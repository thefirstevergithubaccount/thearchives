    <BR><BR>(2) <i>Sunset and Dawn</i> is a novelization of my private diaries. It tells my story pretty accurately, but the names and identifying details of other people have been changed in various ways. I created composite characters, changed who was present during various situations, and in general tried to confuse the facts where other people are concerned. So, please, make no mistake: it's just my story and not anyone else's that is being told there.
