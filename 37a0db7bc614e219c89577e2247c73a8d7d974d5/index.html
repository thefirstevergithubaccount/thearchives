  (1) This material is not public
    <BR><BR>(2) The "Life Story" sections that make up <i>Sunset and Dawn</i> are a novelization of my private diaries. Nearly all of the situations described are true, and most sections were written soon after the events occurred. But many names and identifying details of other people have been changed. I created composite characters, changed who was present during various situations, and generally confused the facts to try to make sure I could show people without seeming to encourage any small-town gossip.
