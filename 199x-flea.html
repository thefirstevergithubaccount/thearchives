	<h2>The Killer Flea</h2><br><br>
            <p>Once there was a dog named Kitty. His owner was Justin Case, an attorney. Kitty led a happy life until, one day, he was bit by Satan de Flea. He ran to Justin, who had a snack in his hand, and jumped right through him. He was just a hologram! The next thing our cute little terrier knew, he was on a spaceship! He staggered back onto a switch. Reverse! Reverse? In space there was no reverse! What was going on? He woke up, only to notice a little flea on his back. He then fell into a vortex to Dimension F. He flew into space, head over heels, tumbling into space. “Goodbye, Justin,” he barked, “Goodbye. Have a nice life, and don’t forget me…”</p>

    "body": "CHAPTER ONE Tuesday, May 13, 1991 8:30 A. M. “…O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave…” sang Miss O’Leary’s class, in Bowie School, on the second floor, in the last classroom. “aaaave. . ” sang Jeremiah Johnson, “Whoops!” 	Everyone sat down. Before I tell you the story, now, I’ll tell you about the uh… characters. First there’s MISS O’Leary… don’t forget the miss, now, because people do a lot. Miss O’Leary is a good teacher, she has a good sense of humor, she is the teacher of 27, I think it is now, kids. There are three Ryans in this class. Ryan Moore, Ryan Purcell, and Ryan Terhune. Ryan Moore is a normal kid, except he always goes on vacations. Ryan Purcell is a lot like Ryan Moore. He’s normal, but he always has something to talk about. Ryan Terhune is anything but normal. He’s one of the three big jokers in the class: Jeremiah, Michael Guammandm whoops, I mean Guamaund, I mean, well, you can pronounce it. (and, of course, Ryan T. is also one of the three). Next, Adam Ares. He is known for Nintendo, we will focus around him the most, um, did I mention that he’s known for Nintendo? Okay, well, I think I’ll just tell you about the other kids as the story goes on. As you read, you’ll see teachers and mothers (in your heads, that is) that, um, enhance the story. Well, sorry for the interruption. On with the story! “Good morning, boys and girls,” said Miss O’Leary to the class. “Good morning, Miss O’Leary,” answered the class. Not much happened during the morning, so I’ll tell you about what happened at recess. “Did you happen to see. . ” “Get out of here!” “Just stop bugging me!” Not much had changed from the rest of the year. The kids were getting along just fine… “Ow! Stop that!” Well, almost. Anyway, as I said before, not much had changed. If you told a noonmother (aide, etc. ) that someone stole your swing, she’d tell you to tell him to give it back. If the kid won’t get off, the noonmother’ll say the same thing. So you just give up. I’ll have you know‑ things weren’t THAT bad. There were only 2 or 3 injuries a week, and people didn’t get in trouble that much. Of course, that was only for MISS O’Leary’s room. No one ever bothered to estimate the number of injuries in the whole school. That would take so long that the number would change and you would have to do it all over again. __ I’ve probably bored you out by now, so I’ll begin with the story. Adam (tah‑dah!) was walking n the playground, hoping he could find a problem to solve. Then he found one. “Hello, Adam!” “Hello, Danny,” answered Adam to the guy who always came up on cue. “So, whaddayawannado?” began Danny, (Adam wished it was his ending. Oh, and by the way, that long word meant what do you want to do?”. ) “Actually,” answered Adam, “I was hoping to spend a nice day alone. ” “Oh, come on,” answered Danny to Adam’s answer. Adam started to run. Danny knew exactly where he was headed… the noonmother! CHAPTER TWO Tuesday, May 13, 1991 11:48 A. M. Adam ran to the noonmother, hoping that for once she would care. Danny didn’t know what to do. But Adam didn’t talk to the noonmother. (he changed his mind at the last second). He just stoof around the (you know), “KNOWING THAT DAN WON’T BUG. . uh‑oh!” Adam had said his thoughts aloud. Adam ran away, and Danny went to bug Matthew Leone. “Come on, Danny!” “Jeremy Lempke smiled!” The rest of recess was normal. People stole swings, fell off of elevated tires, and scaled walls of the playground. There were few injuries that day (34, 35?), and lots of people had just beaten the video game “Super C” (just kidding). As I was saying, the rest of recess was normal, except for the end. That was when someone suddenly swiped Jeremiah’s hand‑held video game, FLASHLIGHT DUDE. No one was expecting it. Here’s how it happened. Jeremiah finished playing, he put the game down, and then yelled to Anthony DelMonte that he could play. Then, as Jer turned around, he saw a figure running away with the game! Anothony saw what happened, and rushed to help. “He went that way!” yelled Jeremiah to Tony, over the roar of the wind, pointing towards the Selser School field. Selser School was the school that Bowie kids go to when they’re in a high enough grade. (the kids will be moving to Selser in Kids #2) “He must be a Selser kid!” YELLED Anthony back to Jeremiah. Adam happened to be nearby, so Tony yelled for him to join the chase. Then something terrible happened. “He’s running into Selser School!”   CHAPTER THREE Tuesday, May 13, 1991 12:14 P. M. “We’re not allowed to go in Selser!” “Too bad!” said Adam, “We have to get the hand‑held game back!” “I don’t know,” said Anthony. Do you… …go with them? if so, turn to chapter 4. …stay outside and cover? If so, turn to… well, keep on reading. “I’ll cover you from here,” stated Anthony. (People call him Antonio) “Okay,” said Jeremiah, “But you’ll probably miss all of the action!” Adam and Jeremiah went inside the school. Then, a terrible thing happened. The bell rang. Everyone started pouring into Bowie School. Pretend you’re Anthony again. Do you: go back into the school? if so, turn to chapter 5. keep guarding the field? if so, keep reading. Anthony stayed in the field. Soon, the figure of Steven Major popped out of Selser School. Jeremiah and Adam followed. “Did you see him?” asked Jeremiah. “Yeah,” said Tony, “It was Steven Major. ” “MAGER?” asked Jeremiah. “No, Major!” said Tony. “I’ve suspected him for a long time,” said Adam. “After him!” yelled Jeremiah. “No, the bell rang. We’ll try our luck tomorrow. ” (Tony said that. ) ADVANCE TO CHAPTER 6.   CHAPTER FOUR Wednesday, May 14, 1991 11:48 A. M. “Okay, I’ll go with you,” announced Anthony. “Well, it look you long enough to decide!” But it was too late. They had strayed into the woods. It took them all recess to find their way out. When the kids watched the news that night, the reporter said: “A boy named Steven Major has been sent to prison for 9,987 years in prison for stealing a hand‑hld game. Unfortunately, the game was crused‑ I mean, crushed by Steve when he became angry as he was being read his rights. ” “Gee, doesn’t that seem a little harsh for just stealing a little game?” asked Anthony. “Well, I have no objections,” said Jeremiah. GO ON TO CHAPTER 7.   CHAPTER FIVE Tuesday, May 13, 1991 12:15 P. M. Anthony went into the school with the others. When inside, Miss O’Leary asked if anyone knew where Adam and Jeremiah were, and Anthony answered, “They went into Selser School to chase someone who had stolen Jeremiah’s little hand‑held electronic game. ” Minutes later, Adam and Jeremiah returned. “Did you get the game?” asked Anthony. “Yes,” replied Jeremiah, “No thanks to you. ” The next day, at recess, Adam asked Anthony if he wanted to come over his house with Jeremiah. TURN TO CHAPTER 4.   CHAPTER SIX Wednesday, May 14, 1991 12:18 P. M. The next day at the school, the kids had a test. Here are problems numbers 1 &amp; 2:    snow: sky=plants:____     2x2x5x8x56x3x98x5x2x1x4=____  They weren’t THAT hard. Anyway, at recess, Adam asked Anthony if he wanted to come with him and Jeremiah, looking for Steven Major (Steven is not in Miss O’Leary’s class). TURN TO CHAPTER 4.   CHAPTER SEVEN Thursday, May 15, 1991 8:30 A. M. The next day, Miss O’Leary’s class received a new student that morning. His name‑ Charles Cunningham! Charles was in Adam’s second grade class. But he was anything but a friend. Charles, or “Baddokid”, as Adam called him, was Adam’s worst enemy. (Oh, and Charles was in Adam’s first grade class, not his second) But he moved away, thanks to Adam, Zachary Mann, and Miguel (i don’t know how to spell his last name, but it’s pronounced man. u. elli. in fact, that might be how you spell it!) Here’s what happened: “All right, Adam! Now you’ll be burned to toast on the burning slide! And you have shorts on!” yelled “Baddokid”. Adam was struggling with Baddo. (Ad called himself Superkid) Then, out of nowhere, came Zachary and Miguel! The kids snuck up behind Charles and blew a whistle right in his ear! (ow!) Baddokid pushed Adam down the slide, as Miguel and Zack watched with fear in their eyes. “No!” yelled Zachary, lunging for the slide. But all he managed to do was knock Baddokid down the hot, hot slide. But what of Adam? “Hey, I need some help down here!” It was the voice of Adam! “I’m losing my grip!” Now that, that was a different voice. The voice of Baddokid! “Oh yeah,” said Adam, “I saved Charles!” CHARLES HAD BEEN SAVED. Later, Adam told Baddokid that if he didn’t stop bugging the Superkid, the kids would blow the whistle in his ear, and tell the teacher about what he had done. Charles agreed. He was the ex‑Baddokid. And now he was in Miss O’Leary’s class! Many of the kids recognized him instantly. Adam raisd his hand. He told the teacher that Charles had been in his first grade class. Charles yelled, “Adam!”   CHAPTER EIGHT Thursday, May 15, 1991 11:47 That recess was terrible! (but it made a great chapter) First, the secret got out, and everybody called Adam “Superkid”. (This part gives me a great opportunity to tell you about some more kids. Amy Cote, some kids, Rachel and Rebecca Roberts, Jeremy Lempke, Jason Slachetka, Christopher Young, Sophia Wilson (I’ll name more later). Second, Charles Cunningham was Baddokid again! He wanted a radical revenge! And Adam would do anything within thinking range that made sense to make sure he coulsn’t. Here’s the scoop: as soon as Charley the bad dude (hey, I like that) saw Adam (Captain A) Super‑Duper Dude Kid (I really like that), he charged. And without a credit card! At the last moment, Adam moved. Charley “Chaplin” crashed into the brick school wall. He never was that bright. Thart made Charley Chalk angry. He started chasing Adam, Adam ran. See Spot run. See Spot sic Dick. Adam suddenly turned around, nailing Charley‑warley in the stomach. Charging Charles ran away. But he soon returned, with a gigantic stick! Charles in Charge swung the almost‑tree trunk‑looking stick aroundm (this is the good part) Adam grabbed the end of the stick, and swung Cheap Charley around and around. Soon Adam swiped the stick out of Baddo‑dude’s hand. “Thanks,” he said.   CHAPTER NINE Friday, May 16, 1991 12:01 P. M. It took a while for Charles Not‑so‑CUNNINGham to find Adam the totally cool, super dooper rad and all around nice guy. But this time both sides were ready. It was army vs. army. The thing is, by the time Charley the Dumb found Sir Adam, it was time to go inside! Inside, the kids found out that Charles Cunningham, a. k. a. Baddokid, had been sent to the wrong school. Charles was gone that day, but Adam will never be able to sleep safe knowing that Baddokid is somewhere in Chicopee. Adam will not rest until Charles Cunningham is where he should be‑ reform school! (what’s that?)   CHAPTER TEN Monday, May 19, 1991 11:49 Adam was just walking around, wondering what to do. He went all the way through the maze on the playground. He finall saw. . a rat! A giant, mutant, ugly rat, about as big as Adam. “Whoa. . what are you supposed to be. . Splinter?” said Ado Ad quickly. “Noooo, I’m Radioactive Rat Man!” said the hairball. “Hey, you know, you sound like Danny!” said Adam. “I am Danny!” “I thought you were Radioactive Rat Man!” “I’m both! You see, I was walking around, looking for you, as Daniel, when I fell into a sewer with rats, goo, and cheese! When I came out, I found I was a rat, and that I had special powers!” “What kind of special powers?” asked Adam. At that moment, Danny lit up, and set a soda can on fire. “Now that’s what I call recycling!” said Rat Man. When it was time to go inside, Rat Man used a spell on himself so that he looked like Daniel. During that time, Mr. Burgess, the principal, came on the intercom. “Good morning, teachers,” said Mr. B, “We have a litte problem outside. Please make sure that no one goes ouside. There’s a 600 pound black bear near us. It’s at the hospital. That’s all. ” Miss O’Leary was out at the time, so Radioactive Rat Man and Superkid came to the rescue. When the heroes arrived, the bear was climbing down from a tree. It looked at Rat Man and Superkid. They were on the menu at McGrizzly’s!   CHAPTER ELEVEN SOME MOMENT OF STRESS… The bear growled. The heroes didn’t want to hurt him. But the bear didn’t care about them. “I have a tranquilizer dart gun!” said Awesome Superkid, “But I have 2 settings: 15 minutes or 30 minutes. The 30 minute one doesn’t always work for more than 2 minutes, and 15 minutes doesn’t give us a very long time!” Pretend you’re Radioactive Rat Man. Do you: Tell him what you think? If so, go to the label X: within this chapter. Let him decide? If so, keep on reading. Radioactive Rat Man didn’t say a word.   X: Soon enough, the bear was asleep (kind of). Rat Man and Superkid flew back into school and quickly made themselves look normal. If you were wondering, Superkid got his special powers from Radioactive Rat Man. The teacher soon came back. No one told her. NEXT CHAPTER: MR. VIDEO! NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: I will no longer write the time with each chapter no. I will instead make a subtitle for each chapter.   CHAPTER TWELVE Mr. Video! It was after school. Adam was at Anthony’s house. Danny had changed back into himself, and Adam had given up being Superkid. Things were pretty much back to normal. (By the way, some more of the pupils in Miss O’Leary’s class are: Deshundra Speigh, Henry Rowland, Mellissa Fargo, Dayna (who cares about her last name anyway) That’s about it. ) Then, Adam defeated the Shadow Boss in DOUBLE DRAGON. All of a sudden, the television blew up! Anthony asked, “Are you all right, Adam?” “Oh, yeah!” said Adam, “But I think your TV needs a trip to the hospital. ” Anthony nodded knowingly. “A‑a‑Adam!” yelled Anthony, “Your arm. . it’s like. . like it’s metallic or something!” Anthony was right. Adam’s arm was a silvery color. “Look!” cried Anthony, “On the TV!” Words had appeared on the screen! They said, PLEASE EXCUSE MY SON. BUT IT IS JUST AS GOOD. WHICH ONE OF YOU HAS A METALLIC ARM? WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU DOES, YOU ARE MR. VIDEO: THE ULTIMATE VIDEO GAMER! YOU NOW WILL BE TRANSPORTED TO VIDEO WORLD, WHERE YOU WILL TAKE A TEST TO SEE IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAVE THE WORLD. xtu‑768j “Did he say what I think he just sai. . ” started Adam. But he was stopped short by a warp zone in his friend’s living room.   CHAPTER THIRTEEN EVENT NUMBER 1 “Hello, aaaand welcome to another contest to see if we can find a person to save the Earth!” said a computerized voice, “And what is your given name, Mr. Video?” “A. . Adam Ar. . Ares, sir. ” “And now for the first event. . Taekwonvideo!” Three minutes later, it was time to start. “Go!” yelled the voice. Adam stared at the obviously trained oppoent. Then he remembered Taekwondo from Track And Field II. He decided to use some of his tips for the game on this dude. The, uh, OPP. used a foot sweep on Adam. Adam fell. Adam remembered his trick. See Spot run. See Spot sic dick. As the opp. tried to kick Adam when he was down, he rolled away, causing his opp. to slip and fall. As soon as both of the contestants were up, Adam ran. The opp. followed. Suddenly, Adam turned around and kneed the opp. right in the stomach. The opp. stepped back in pain, 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8…9…10! “The winner! Adam A‑Ares, also known as Mr. Video!” The crowd applauded like crazy. Adam had passed the first test, but what was this about saving the world? And who was this computerized voice? Adam wanted some answers. “Okay!” yelled Adam, “Who are you? And what is this about saving the world?” “That’s for me to know, and for you to find out,” remarked the voice. “The next event,” thundered a voice, “Is the obstacle course!”   CHAPTER FOURTEEN Event #2 is CANCELLED! “Now,” said the voice, “This is the obstacle course. ” “Listen,” said Adam, “Whoever you are, I’m coming to get you. You can tell me your side of the story when I find you. ” There was no response. Adam looked around. There was a staircase leading to a door on his left. He headed for it. As he was climbing, the stairs suddenly turned into a giant slide! Adam grabbed the railing and slowly worked his way up. When he got to the top, he found that the door was locked! He stepped back, and with all of his strength, kicked the door down. As he stepped inside, the computerized voice said, “I congratulate you for getting this far. But I will now finish you off!” “You know,” said Adam calmly, “I heard something like that in Ninja Gaiden. ” Then he saw him. He was an old man with a cane. “You’re the powerful wizard of Oz?” joked Adam. “I do not understand your humor,” said the old man, “My name is. . Matthew Cunningham. ” “M‑m‑Matthew CUNNINGHAM?” asked Adam, “Are you per chance related to Charles Cunningham?” “Yes” answered the, uh, Matthew, “Are you per chance. . Superkid?” “I am,” answered Adam. Matthew lunged for Adam. See spot run. See Spot sic Dick. Matthew fell back in pain, and as Adam went to kick again, Matthew flew up, punching Adam in the face and knocking him down. Matthew was about to jump on Superkid, to do what Charles could not!   CHAPTER FIFTEEN RETURN TO EARTH! Adam rolled away at the last second, causing Matthew to crash into the hard ground. Then Matthew revealed his true identity‑ Anthony! “I had you going there for awhile, didn’t I?” remarked Antonio. He explained how he took out xtu‑768j. He had used a strange sphere to look like an old man. Seconds later, Adam and Anthony were returned to Earth. As soon as they came home, they forgot all about Video World (for 1 night). The next day, they watched a movie. The name: Video World Tests! THE NEXT CHAPTER WILL BE THE LAST AND ONE OF THE BEST. AT LEAST I THINK SO…   CHAPTER SIXTEEN SCHOOL’S OUT! Date: June 18, 1991. Characters I didn’t name: Erica Leone. Special Events: Last day of school! It was a dark and stormy day. The kids were in school. It was the last day of fourth grade. There was a bad storm outside. A tornado could form at any minute. The kids were terrified, especially during science. The chapter: Wind and Storms. They learned about the great storms that knock schools over‑‑ even brick ones. They learned that winds could break windows, sending glass all over the room. Soon Henry asked if he could sharpen his pencil. As he was sharpening, a window broke over the force of the wind! Fortunately, the glas hit no one, not even Henry. But he got pulled outside of the window! Being on the second floor, it would be a long fall! But then Henry yelled for help, and Jeremy was the first one there. Henry had grabbed onto the window sill of the clinic, downstairs. The wind was forcing his legs into the air. He was losing his grip. Jeremy suddenly got an idea. He grabbed the teacher’s yardstick. He let it down. Henry grabbed onto it. Jeremy tugged with all of his strength. Finally, Henry was up in the classroom! For the tenth time in his life, Jeremy Lempke smiled in the classroom. It was a moment to cherish. That afternoon, the children said good‑bye to Miss O’Leary and promised to visit the classroom. See what happens to the kids in fifth grade in KIDS #2. "

    "title": "Kids #2: Fifth Grade Fear (Fifth Grade Series, 1991)",
    "body": "KIDS #2: FIFTH GRADE FEAR CHAPTER ONE FIFTH GRADE FEAR This was the big day. All the fourth graders going into Selser School would learn what classroom they would be in. Unfortunately, the kids that were in Miss O’Leary’s class last year were split up. But, since Adam’s in Mrs. Well’s class, we’ll focus on that classroom. As the bell rang, all of the kids poured into Selser School, sending a chill up teachers’ spines. The kids didn’t do any work that day. That afternoon, they had a new and interesting way of going onto the playground. During their time on the main part of the playground, Adam, Brian, Zachary, and Matthew Woods (a new kid) were on the swings. Ryan Purcell and Matthew were swinging high. The swings seemed like they might tip over at any second. All of a sudden, there was a thump. Matthew Woods had a broken swing. The thump had been Matt hitting the ground, about a meter and 5 inches away from the swings. He was okay. His arm just hurt a little for a few minutes. Other than that, recess was remarkably a success. The kids were probably just excited because they knew they were growing up. There was an honor roll in this school, and, all in all, it was exciting. It was the beginning of a new era for the kids, an era of- “Shut up!” Oh, yes. I forgot about even more sarcasm and violence. The Selser students used the same playground as the Bowie kids. But as soon as the first bell rang, the torture began. Fifteen minutes without shade in sight. It was nightmarish. There was shade, but the noonmothers didn’t want the kids to go there. It kind of makes you wonder what they’re payed for, doesn’t it? Oh, I almost forgot. Henry’s brother, Peter, is in Mrs. Well’s class, as well as Amy’s sister, Wendy. Personally, I think Peter will let me write anything about him in this book. . so I will. Later on, a dark figure pulled Ryan Purcell into the woofs. “Hey,” said the figure, “You want one?” He held up a box of shiny figures and smiled.   CHAPTER TWO FRIENDS &amp; FOES Meanwhile, the other kids couldn’t believe how fast they were growing. Then Ryan came up and told the story to Adam, Danny, and Brian. The rest of recess was quiet, and no one told Mrs. Wells. . or Ryan’s mom!!!! That afternoon, Ryan Purcell went swimming. He for the first time went to the deep end of the pool. (He wasn’t a very good swimmer!) But, he was hanging onto a kickboard, and using it. But, as he was hanging onto the side, the kickboard came out and was just under his feet. Ryan struggled to get fully back onto the board. But, as fate shall have it, it did not work. The board came out from under his feet, and went flying like a torpedo. Ryan Purcell was not able to climb over the edge of the pool, so he hung on for dear life. He was there, clutching the wall for at least a couple of minutes until his mother came, who was definitely unlike Ryan. She could be a professional swimmer if she wanted. She hopped into a pool, like a baby dolphin returning from its voyage into the sky. She picked up her son, and while Ryan was catching his breath, neighbors were laughing. Ryan had never been laughed at before, but the kids who were at that time seemed to be having so much funn that Ryan Purcell joined in. The other kids found that completely pathetic and took off. “Gee,” said Ryan, “I should make fun of other people a lot. It could cheer me up. ” The next day, Ryan P. was with Jason and Ryan Moore, climbing the structures on the playground. Adam just happened to be nearby, just wondering why the heck Dan wasn’t bugging him today. As he was wandering around, a dark figure approached him. Before Adam had time to react, the figure was tugging on his shirt. Soon Adam was in some strange secret section of the playground. Adam immediately recognized the figure as a video game character! “Grant DaNasty!!!!!”   CHAPTER THREE FLASHBACK! Now, Grant DaNasty is a character from Castlevania 3: Dracula’s Curse. First you defeat him in battle, and then he joins the forces of good. And here was Adam, standing next to him. “COWABUNGA!” yelled Adam, “Grant! What. . I mean… what are you doing… how? Who? Gimme some answers here!” “Yeah,” said Grant, “I’m Mr. DaNasty dude. . But, I’m also Danny…” “Oh, gimme a break,” said Adam, “First it was Radioactive Rat Man, and now. . now look at you! You’re an ex-pirate with a craving to climb around! Okay, how’d it happen?” “Okay, well, uh, well, uh, well, uh. . I was over at Matthew’s house, and I’d just beaten Grany. Then… then I was just. . sucked into the game!” “Yeah,” said Adam, “That for some reason has been happening a lot lately. Oh, sorry. Continue. ” “Now, um, I was exploring Castlevania, and I found a way to get out, and here I am now. . Grant!” “Wow!” said Adam, “Life is sure full of surprises, huh? What’s say we be partners?” “Okay,” said Grant, “But you’ll have to get used to me having to hunch. ” Soon, Grant and Mr. Video were battling the forces of evil. (You think being a hero is easy? Try being one for a day. Or a lifetime!!) It wasn’t very long until they met a dark figure. “Now go!” they heard him say, “You must not fail! There are many depositors in the Bank of The Mushroom Kingdom! I will be rich!” As soon as the men had left, and only that dark figure had stayed, the team charged out. “Okay,” said Mr. Video, “Your number’s up! Now serving 21!” The dark figure turned around. The face would terrify anyone that had known who he was. The face was bloody. . all red, with very little face remaining. “Who the heck. . ” started Grant. “I,” said the figure, “Am Bloody Cough. But, my real name is Richard M. Cunningham. ” “No way. . no coincidence has ever been this big! YOU!!!!” “What?” asked Grant, “How do you know he’s related. . ” But Adam was thinking back. . It was… 1988. . “Charles! What do you want from me? Why? What did I ever do to you?” It was Adam. He was struggling with Charles on the tires. They seemed high back then. Adam… lost his balance…   CHAPTER FOUR EXCITING!!! Adam fell off of the tires, falling several feet. He had dirt all over him. “Charles! You weren’t always this bad! Why? Why. . are you doing this?” “Nnnngh!” groaned Charles, “Because I am me, and there is nothing you can do about it. ” “I’ll change your evil ways in the future!” “Try it,” said Charles, “Because when I have to, I’ll call up my uncle. . Richard!” “What’s his last name?” “By coincidence. . Cunningham!” “You probably don’t even have an uncle! If you did, he probably disowned your. . somebody to get away from you!” “You’ll see!” And now, it was 1991. (Or 1992, or 1993, or even 9997!) Here was Richard. Just before Baddokid had gotten his name, he had forseen this moment. Almost. And soon, a lightning bold landed into Richie’s hand! “NO WAY!” chanted Mr. Video and Grant. Richard lowered his arm and sent the lightning bold toward Mr. Video. “Ahhhhhhhh!” said Mr. Video, “That seemed like a recharge!” But he was cut short by a bolt headed straight for Grant! It hit the G-Man! He changed back into Daniel. “Man,” said Dan, “I can never stay a super-hero for long!” “If you’re not careful, you might not be a human for too long!” yelled Mr. Video. Mr. Video changed into the wolf from Altered Beast and used a flying kick right into the bad dude’s stomach. He fell, and fell, and fell. He landed on his feet like a cat and ran, and ran, and ran. That afternoon, Ryan Purcell got a phone call telling him to go into the woods at 6:30 sharp. Ryan did. When he went, he saw a figure with a gun. “Wha-what are you doing here?” That was all Ryan Purcell could say before he was knocked out cold.   CHAPTER FIVE JUST DO IT! The next day, no one knew what had happened to Ryan Purcell. They figured he just had a fever or something. So, when Brian Rondeau went for a walk in the very same woods, and found a note from Ryan Purcell, hw was kind of surprised. It read: Help! CaPtuRed! THIs Is rYan PUrCell! You WoN’T BelIeVE Who Capotured. . Oh, no… That was all. Brian automatically ran home to call Henry, Peter, Adam, and- no one else. Everyone called everyone else until everyone knew. The kids excitedly made plans to meet in the woods to search for clues. No one told Mrs. Wells because they knew she wouldn’t let the kids help rescue Ryan. After school, the kids met in the woods. Soon the kids found a trail of popcorn. They followed the trail until they came to a swamp. “What now?” “What else?” “You don’t mean. . ” “We must!” After the swamp, the kids found the trail again. “Hey, what’s that?” asked Matthew Burns. “Leaves,” said Katie, “It’s a new trend. ” But… it was a trap! the kids fell in! Only Anthony was left out! But then, a tree began to fall!   CHAPTER SIX ESCAPE!!! All of a sudden, Adam turned into Mr. Video in an instant, who changed into Digger T. Rock. He dug really fast as he pushed the kids down. The kids fell into a pre-dug tunnel! “Gee,” said Mark, “I wonder what your friend Anthony is doing right now, Ad!” He just so happened to be laughing. “I finally got him! Ha, ha, ha. . !” At that time, the other kids were busy dodging spears because Matthew Shea said the wrong password. “Open sesame?!” yelled Matthew Leone, “Oh, you and your big mouth!” Just then, as Adam had changed into Super Mario from Super Mario World for faster running speed, he was struck by an arrow! If you want him to be okay, keep reading. If not, well, too bad. The arrow changed Super Mario into Small Mario! The kids continued on. “Check it!” yelled Matt L. , “sunlight!” It was true. The tunnel had come to an end. When they were out, everyone was wondering where the heck Anthony was. But instead, they saw Charles Cunningham (See KIDS #1)   CHAPTER SIX 1/2 YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE Charles Cunningham. . Adam’s worst enemy. And because of that, the whole class that Adam belonged to was a terrible enemy to Charles… Baddokid. And now he was standing in front of Mrs. Wells’ class- along with some other friends. “Yo, Adam!” said Baddokid, “Shall we?” But, now, they were no longer in the woods. They were in some kind of arena. “Where in the. . amazing world am I?” asked Adam to no one in particular. “This is the KKF Kickboxing Championship match. We now have Superkid vs. the notorious Baddokid!” It was a voice from out of nowhere. But who cares? Adam then noticed that he had a log stick in his hand as a weapon. So did Baddokid. He swung it around. Adam dropped his stick. Charles swung it around again. Adam got knocked out. Soon, he was in the ocean. Actually, Matthew L. was splashing a bucket on his head. “You know,” said Michael, “When I asked you to get a bucket of water so my friend could wake up, I didn’t want you to splash it on yourself!” “Adam!” yelled Dan, “You fainted!” Then, Ad was in the old west! He was at a showdown with Charley the Kid. “Ten paces, you dead duck!” yelled Adam the Great. 1…2…3. . Charley the Kid turned around and fired. Adam was on the cold ground, but he was just outside of the woods. He continued on. He had to hurry. Ryan Purcell was missing.   CHAPTER SEVEN UFOS AND RYAN P. The next day, on the playground, Adam happened to be near Jason, who was in his fourth grade class, hanging from a couple of bars. “Hey, J, what’s up?” Before you could say “extraterrestrial” (even though that’s not very quick), a U. F. O. landed right next to the two. Soon, a very strong force pulled both Jason and Adam towards the object. Once the two were inside the oval purple object, the martians revealed themselves. “Moths?!” yelled Adam and Jason at the same time. “OoomutbaAdokinofvidgam!” said one alien. “He said, ‘You must be Adam, king of the video games. ” explained alien #1. The martians asked if the kids would mind being dissected. The tubular twosome said they would mind. They just wanted to go home. Next Adam changed into Mr. Video. Then Mr. Video changed into Bang from Crash At Demonhead. “Mr. Video!” yelled alien #2. Bang transported home with the power of teleport. Adam and Jason didn’t tell anyone. That day, while searching for Ryan Purcell, the kids found him tied to a tree. But then, Baddokid came and knocked all of the boys into next week. The girls saved Ryan and ran. See Spot get saved. See Spot get terribly embarrassed.   CHAPTER EIGHT I LOVE TO BLAST ALIEN SCUM! Soon, Adam was aboard Zoda’s spaceship! It was the next day. Adam knew that he would have to fight his way through the spaceship. And it would be a challenging task. After collecting two crystals, Adam came to Zoda. Zoda himself. “Hello, mortal Adam!” yelled Zoda from the darkness, “Welcome to destiny!” “I don’t believe in destiny,” shouted Adam, “I believe in fate!” That’s when he noticed the giant hand of Zoda. A chill went up Adam’s spine as he screamed. The scream sent Zoda’s hand back into the darkness. Soon, Adam was able to see his enemy’s head. Adam fired with a high-tech gun lying on the ground until Zoda blew up! But he was still alive! Except. . he was purple! He jumped over a deep hole. Adam took a detour until he came across Zoda again. But then he saw Anthony DelMonte! He disappeared. After defeating Zoda, Adam saved Ryan Purcell again. He had been captured by Zoda. Ryan told Adam that Anthony had kidnapped him. THIS STORY WILL BE CONTINUED IN KIDS #3: VIDEO GAME VULTURES. NEXT BOOK: THE TRUTH ABOUT ANTHONY! BADDOKID’S REVENGE! VIDEO GAME CHEATS! COOL!!! "

    "body": "Adam Ares was (this is real, now) a normal kid, and he was usually found groovin’ to the beat of Michael Jackson. (ages 2-3) Later (ages 4-5) he formed a club by using a laundry washroom of his Grandmother’s house and had each of the members (Adam and his counsins) had a desk. Adam’s cousins were: Kenneth and Christopher Rooney, Amy Fortin, and Jodi Fortin. They named their club “The Kids Club”. Now there are lots of Kids Clubs. But back then there was only one- The USA Network Kids Club. So, the club was in business. They didn’t do much, though. They just put up posters and talked about how much grown-ups were bothering them. Soon, the Kids Club was gone. They were no longer allowed to use the washroom. So, laster, when Grandman bought a new freezer, the kids used the box as a club. They changed the name to “The Rainbow Connection Club”. Later the box was taken away. . to put Christmas presents in! The kids never saw their clubhouse again. Soon, the kids were making clubs at Adam’s house, using his room. The A. C. K. Club, The Isis Club, The Motech Club (Ad’s personal fav) and The Jr. Nintendo Club. The Jr. Nintendo Club was cancelled not long ago. Just a few months ago, or a year, or a decade, depending on when you read this, Adam and Chris, Ken and Amy made a video game creating company: A. K. C. , Awesome Kids’ Cartridges. It was stoopped short by an issue of NINTENDO POWER that said kids could not submit games into Nintendo of America, Inc. Now, Adam is writing this book, and is starring in this book, along with his real fourth grade classmates! "

    "title": "Kids #4: Camp of the Past (Fourth Grade Series) (1991)",
    "body": "CHAPTER ONE PROLOUGE Okay, now, here’s the story so far: the kids were in fourth grade. Adam changed into Mr. Video and Daniel into Radioactive Rat Man. In fifth grade, Daniel changed into Grant DaNasty, but was changed back into Daniel soon after. Mr. Video’s powers are those to change into a video game character and use his/her powers. Ryan Purcell was kidnapped and then rescued by girls, and then Adam was sucked aboard an alien spacecraft. Adam managed to defeat the aliens on the ship and rescue Ryan Purcell again, but soon many other problems arose. Daniel was acting strange, and Ryan Purcell thought that Anthony DelMonte kidnapped him the first time. But Adam had seen Baddokid, whose real name was Charles Cunningham, at the scene of the crime! Soon, Baddokid revealed that he used an image-making machine to create the illusion of Anthony. Adam defeated Baddokid, and soon, Ryan Purcell foiled a plan of Charles’s to blow up the school. Danny was acting strange because he heard about Baddokid’s plan to blow up the school. Soon, a plane flew overhead during recess of the day that was before the first day of Christmas Vacation. The plane dropped something that looked like a bomb! NEXT CHAPTER: RADICAL CAMP OF THE PAST!   CHAPTER TWO RADICAL CAMP OF THE PAST Now, soon, the kids found that this object was not a bomb. They were ads! Ads for a camp. They read: CAMP BUNCHADANGER COME ON! HAVE FUN! BE ADVENTUROUS! THIS CAMP IS COOL! AIR CONDITIONING (ALL SEASON) HIKES, BIKING, CANOEING, TAEKWONDO, COMPUTERS AND MORE! OPEN ALL YEAR All of the kids in Mr. Coburn’s class decided to go. The next day, Matthew was reading a book. It read: (here we go again) Amy: Hello! I’m Amy, the time machine toll booth worker! Where are you from and where are you going? Matt: I’m from 1991, and I’m going to, um, 2044. Meanwhile, in real life. . “WE HAVE TO GET ADAM AND HIS FRIENDS! I NEED REVENG!” It was a shadowy, and unfortunately familiar, figure! Charles Cunningham, a. k. a. Baddokid! One of Charles’s men said, “Everyone in Adam’s class is going to camp. ” “Good,” said Baddokid, “That will be the perfect place to strike. Is my image-maker still working?” “Yes, sir!”   CHAPTER THREE BUS TO NOWHERE Days later, the day before. . we interrupt this part of the story to bring you this special announcement. Baddokid is on his way to the camp as we speak. (ha, ha) He is with two of his men. Right now he is on the same bus as the kids from Mr. Coburn’s class. And now. . oh no! He’s going onto the train, uh, bus section as the kids! Fortunately, Brian was using his Spy Tech rear-view glasses, and he saw Adam’s worst enemy- Charles Cunningham! And Baddokid held in his hand- a brick!   CHAPTER FOUR THE TRUTH ABOUT MR. VIDEO! Adam was just dreaming up that last chapter. The next day, Adam told Danny how he had really become Mr. Video. “You see,” said Adam, “It was one of those sort of can’t-make-up-its-mind-if-it-wants-to-be-gray-or-sunny kind of days. A day typical for Chicopee, Ma. , hope to the kids. Matthew came into his own house that Adam was visiting- oops, I’ve just remembered-okay! The other way was the truth. But here’s the story of Captain Nintendo: It was like soty of can’t-make-up-its-mind-if-it-wants-to-be-gray-or-sunny kind of day. Typical for Redmond, Washington, home of the headquarters for Nintendo of America, Inc. Maxwell W. Powers lumbered into the Research and Development Special Projects Department with a package that had been delivered to Data Entry by mistake. Max’s best friend, Brett Randalls, put his Metroid game on pause. “Ho, ho, ho,” said Max, “I have a nice package for some little techhead who’s been very good this year. It says, ‘Napaji Microchips. Avoid exposure to moisture and extreme temperatures. ’” “All right!” exclaimed Brett, “We’ve been waiting for these!” “So where is Tara? Have you two interfaced yet?” asked Max. “I know this story,” said Daniel. The next day was the bus trip to camp.   CHAPTER FIVE BUS TO NOWHERE 2: THE SEQUEL The bus was putting along the dirt roads, when uh. . Adam flew out of an open window. Yeah, that’s it. And, uh, Baddokid was on the roof. Oh, that’s a lie. Despite the title of the chapter, we’ll tell you what happened at camp. . Baddokid was waiting outside of the camp. He walked in with the other kids. Um. . oh yeah! I forgot! There were seven groups of campers. One had Mr. Coburn’s class, one had a boy named Miguel and many more kids, another one had Baddokid and a bunch of other kids, and the other groups just had a bunch of kids in it. Miguel was in Ad’s first grade class. Baddokid plotted to get rid of Adam once and for all! In an attack by Baddokid (Miguel couldn’t stop it) Adam was knocked out cold!   CHAPTER SIX CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY He began to dream. (If you make this into a movie, fade out into dream sequence) He was Charlie Brown! (bummer) And Daniel was Linus! But he didn’t carry around a blanket! (bigger bummer. . hey how could I tell him from) The kid’s music teacher, Misses (Mrs. ) LaFond was Schroder! (I can’t spell) And soon, the plot thickened. The little red head girl was coming over Charles’s house! (NOT Baddokid’s, unfortunately) Everyone would know who Adam secretly liked! When the Red HeaD (I’m sloppy tonight) came over, she was. . The Little Red Head Girl! Soon Adam moved to his next dream.   CHAPTER SEVEN BULLWINKLE &amp; MR. VIDEO! Anthony was Bullwinkle, and Adam was Mr. Video! The two were walking down the street. Then, Adam was Superkid, and he was battling Baddokid! This was the classic fight. “All right, Adam! Now you’ll be burned to toast on the burning slide! And you have shorts on!” yelled Baddokid. Adam was struggling with Baddo. Then, out of nowhere, came Zachary and Miguel! To make a long story short, the other kids blew a whistle in Baddokid’s ear, and Adam and Baddo went tumbling down the slide. They saved themselves, though. Soon, Adam dreamed he was a baby. He was crying and crying! Boy, that was annoying! Next he woke up. He was surrounded by Baddokid’s men. 	“Now I’ll finally put an end to you, Superpig!” "

Later, the kids saved Ryan Purcell twice, once from Baddokid, and once from aliens. Then, the kids held a video game contest. The winner cheated, so the kids went after him. Later, the kids went to camp. Baddokid knocked Adam out. When our hero awoke, he was in Baddokid’s house. Adam escaped. Now, on with the tale. . in the year 2005, our tale takes place, at least a small portion of it. Adam was telling his friend, 78787878, stories of his childhood. “Yeah, back then Super Nintendo was new, and they only had 2 Zelda and Mario games for Nintendo!” “I remember back then,” said 78787878. Then, Adam told (don’t make me write it) an exciting story. (Flashback!) (We now continue the in intreg–uh–exciting story)(Story of KIDS #4) “Whew!” said Adam, sweating, “That was close!” Adam had just barely escaped from the grips of Baddokid. He returned to camp. “And then, the beautiful princess replied to the prince she so much loved… HOLY COW! WHAT THE HECK’S THAT!?!” said, screamed, and barfed Adam. “Man, what a spooky story!” said Matthew. “No, dude, what’s that thing in the sky?” yelled Ad. “I don’t know,” replied Daniel, “But it’s readed right for us!” “Into the mess hall, mon!” Those were the last words Adam could say before there was a gigantic ka-boom and the kids ached all over.   CHAPTER TWO SPACE JUNK, FACE FUNK, CYBER PUNK, LEAK CRASH!!! The thing crashed into the mess hall. Debris flew all around the camp. “A meteor!” yelled Adam. “Good call, dudee! If we had listened to you, we’d all be toast!” screamed Daniel. “Well, excuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me!” said Ad. Back in civilization, Adam was playing the NES game “Ninja Gaiden II”. No, he wasn’t sucked into Video World again, but as he was battling Ashtar, he got up to get a glass of water, and as he was coming back from the kitchen, he noticed that his mom was on the couch. She accidentally knocked Adam’s water out of his hands. Adam walked outside (his mother had unplugged the Nintendo) Then, suddenly, two hands covered with black, leather gloves pulled him into a dark alley. On his face was a mask made of metal. “Come with me, little boy!” Elsewhere, Ryan Purcell was outside. Two purple gloves grabbed him. “Have a nice day, dude!” He had a metal mask on. “COOL!” That was all Ryan could say before he was knocked out cold. We now return to the year 2005. “Here comes the good part,” says Adam, “Okay, um, I was brought to some room with many gadgets. Then I saw Ryan Purcell in some kind of chari with wires connected to it. ‘TAKE THESE OR DIE!’ Ryan P. didn’t know what to do. Nor I. ”   CHAPTER THREE MR. RAY FILLET The year: who cares? It’s in the future. Our 2 dudes are talking. (Adam and Mr. X) “Okay, I’ll listen to the rest of your story after. Here, I’ll read one of my childhood favorites. It’s in french, but I’ll translate. . CA SENT LE POISSON! (It smelled like fish) “Chouette!” said Michaelangelo of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Cute!) “Ouah!” said Raphael, (Huh?). . ” “Okay, man, just say it in English. Merci. ” “Speaking of ‘man’,” said Mr. X, “I’ll fast forward to the part where… oh, drat, my translator’s broken down!” “Sorry to hear that,” said a voice, “I believe you know me! “M-MAN RAY???!!! YOU!” “The one and only!” Back in 199X, where we left off before. . All of a sudden, a voice said, “Okay, you guys. I’m with the police. We’ve got this place completely surrounded!” Then he ran over to Ry P. and Ad. “I’ve been following your voice. I’m Ray Fillet! Say, Ryan, why do you keep getting captured?” “I don’t know!” SAID SUPER RYAN PURCELL (just kidding) “I know!” said someone, “And so, I now transform you, Ryan Purcell, into Leatherbrain!” “NNNOOOO!” “But, who are you?” asked Adam, “And why did you transform Ryan here into Leatherbrain?” “I changed your friend into Leatherbrain for a reason that is my own. ” Adam charged at the character, but the shadow soon became an image. YUCK!   CHAPTER FOUR COMIC BOOK CONVENTION! Back to the future. . (heh, heh) “MAN RAY?” “Come quick!” “What is it?” asked Mr. X. “No time to explain! Hurry!” Back in 199X, we continue our story…“Who are you?” yelled Leatherbrain. “I am. . . Mary Bones! With the power of the turnstone, I turn you, Adam Ares, into Bubbla The Glubub!” “NOOOOO!” “You jerkette!” yelled Ryan-uh, Leatherbrain, “We’ll get you!” “Mon, what are we? Why did she- Ray! Do you know what’s going on?” “No, I don’t!” On the street, two guys dressed up and bought 2 comic books. “YOU’RE COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS! MARY BONES AND LEATHER-HEAD, AND BUBBLA THE GLUBUB, AND MAN RAY- a. k. a. RAY FILLET! That was the last thing Adam, now transformed into Bubbla, remembered before he blacked out, along with Ryan Purcell.   CHAPTER FOUR 1/2 WHO AM I??? In the year 200X, Adam wakes up to find that his adventure was a dream. He starts to eat his pillow when his dog climbs on his water bed which causes it to leak which causes Adam to grab his dog which causes the dog to yip, and, well, I’ll tell you this story some other time. But the adventure was a fream, although this one wasn’t! Back to the year 199X, the two now-strange animals regained consciousness, and found themselves to be back to normal. “What’s going on?” “Don’t ask me, Ryan!” The two were finally able to get outside. What they saw was spectacular. “HOME!” “Hey,” said the guy from KIDS #1, “Wanna try a little of this? Huh? Try it! NOW!” He stuffed one of something in both kids’ mouths. Soon, again, the kids blacked out. “I’M TIRED OF THIIIISSS…” (Editing note: the rest of this book is missing. ) "

    "body": "CHAPTER ONE CRIMINAL SCHOOL &amp; THE FATE OF EARTH Okay, man, you’re gonna LOVE this book. (NOT literally) You’ll enjoy it even more if you’ve read at least KIDS WINTER EDITION: DEJA VU. When we left off, Adam A. could change into Mr. Video, a dude who could change into any video game character. Ryan Purcell and Adam had been kidnapped, and were being brainwashed into thinking that they were criminals, while Jeremiah and Ryan Terhune were fighting Martians on the moon. Ryan accidentally sent a missle straight to the planet Earth! So now, sit back or lay down and enjoy KIDS #5. (Please!) “I don’t feel like a criminal,” said Ryan Purcell. “Ah, but you are!” said a voice. The man stepped forward. He was revealed to be. . Baddokid, a. k. a. Charles Cunningham. He was the KIDS worst enemy. “Now, I want to, uh, make sure you haven’t lost your knack for crime. ” “This guy’s putting on a convincing act, but I know I’m not a crook. I can feel it. . I can just feel it,” thought Adam. “Whoa, man, this is cool! I’m a criminal! Who’d a thunk it?!” thought Ryan Purcell. “Heh, heh, heh,” thought Baddokid, “Now I’ve got them. They don’t suspect a thing!” Back on some planet in the Andromenda galaxy…. “OH, GREAT GOING, RYAN!” screamed Jeremiah, “NOW SOME KA-BOOM MISSLE’S ON A COLLISION COURSE TO EARTH! AND WE HAVE NO MEANS OF GEE- GETTING HOME? WHY. . would. . we want to?” “Hey, wait a second,” said Ryan, “The Earth spins, and the missle wasn’t fully powered up! It should only do some minor damage!” “But where?” “I think. . Hawaii!” At the same time, Adam made his move and was mopping up the deck with Baddokid. The two heroes finally were able to escape.   CHAPTER TWO AN INCREDIBLE UNDAWADDA ADVENTURE “NOW WHO AM I? I KNOW I’M NOT A BAD DUDE. . SO. . ” “Shh,” whispered Ryan P. , “Be quiet!” “Oh yeah! Sorry!” “Let’s go window shopping!” said Ryan. “Okay! Hey, look, a television!” The TV showed a commercial for Zelda III! “I AM MR. VIDEO! THE NINTENDO POWER IS YOURS!” “Hey. . that’s it! I’m Adam Ares, and I can change into Mr. Video! But. . and you’re Ryan Purcell! Remember. . you kept getting kidnapped! Ya know? Please?. . ” “Hey. . yeah! Everything’s coming back to me!” “Look!” yelled Mr. Video, “That ship’s sinking! It’s not far away! If they can’t swim, we’ll help them!” So the 2 jumped into the water. “Blub, blub. . ” The two were captured! “Greetings,” said a voice, “I mean you know harm. I am Crazy. ” “We know,” said Adam. “Oh. You humans must be smarter than I figured,” said the mer-man guy, “I am an Atlantian, from Atlantis. I am far from home. ” “Yeah, the funny farm,” whispered Adam. “Yo, I mean, where the heck are we?” asked Ryan P. “We are in my submersible yugoyugo, or as you call it, U. F. O. . ” “Why have you taken us?” “For two reasons. One, you were in the neighborhood. Two, I need to show you some things. Before it’s too late. ” “What might that be?” asked Adam. “The future, past, and present of Earth. Come. Speculate. Step into my rererunham, or, ‘time machine’. ” ZZAAAAPPP! “You must be careful. Here is what would have happened if Ryan Purcell here was not turned into Leatherbrain… “Okay, now what?” asked Adam. “I dunno,” answered Ryan, “I’m kinda shook up, after that. . Who are you?” “I’m your worst nightmare. Eat lead, suckers!” BLAM! BLAM! ZZZAAAPPP! “Wha- who- wher- whe- why- how-?” asked Ryan Purcell. “You were ‘pumped fulla lead’. ” “And, so. . ” asked Adam. “So. . you will be. . truly if you’re not careful,” said the Atlantian with a sigh.   CHAPTER THREE NOT-SO-RAMBO “I now return you to your houses. ” “We’ve got to save ourselves!” said Adam. “What about the people on the shit?” “Let ‘em eat cake. . AYYIIIIE!” ZZZAPPP! “Earth-thlings,” said the Atlantian dude. Later, on the playground, Adam and Ryan Purcell were worried. (No duh) “Hey, Ry! Do ya think he’s right? Ya know, about the, uh, part about us getting, ya know, shot at?” “Yeah, well, I don’t know. If we’re careful. . ” “Heh heh heh,” laughed a voice, “I know you. But not for long!” “NOW WHAT?!” “Uh… there’s no place like home. . there’s no place like. . ” “OH, BE QUIET!” yelled Adam, “No wonder you’ve been kidnapped so many times! You’re such a sissy!” Adam kicked the gun of of the strange guy’s hand. Then he grabbed it. “Two can play at that game! Now, come along slowly, or…” “HAI!” yelled a voice, “Try and fight without your gun!” yelled a voice. The dark figure kicked the gun out of Adam’s hand. He picked up the gun. He was still in the shadows. “Ow! Man, will you guys stop kicking me!” yelled the gun. ? “What the heck. . ” started the shadow dude, “I’m outta ‘ere!” The two (ahem) bad dudes ran away. “But. . how?” stuttered Ryan Purcell. “I know Ronn Lucas,” said Adam. Three days later, Mr. Coburn announced to his class that there would be a dance for Valentine’s Day, but it would only be for the 6th graders. That day, in a prison cell. . “Finally! I get parole tomorrow noon!” said some really bad caught dude. He was caugh by the police, “But, that’s too long to wait. I’ll break out today and cause a few deaths– like on kids! Yeah! I could do something to a school! In a little town. . like Turners Falls, or Chicopee! YEAH!” “BE QUIET! I’M TAKING A NAP!” “AHH, SHUT UP, YOU STUPID BARF-BRAINED. . ”   CHAPTER FOUR (ripped) (rip) was working in his “office”, he came (rip) “Oh, man, o manomanomanoman!” Adam (rip) He was refering to the test tube (rip) and fizzing. He was experimenting (rip) “Oh, man! I mixed the wrong ones! (rip) this is! Uh… this is messy. I’ll go (rip) when he got outside, he opened the gate. “Oh, hi, Muttface,” he said to his dog. Meanwhile, at hte prison… “Now to cause some serious damage!” said some really bad dude, “Like in Chicopee!” Elsewhere, at Matthew’s house… “Hey, Anthony!” yelled Matt, “I got to level. . ahhhhh!” “Huh? WHere’d he go? Is he hiding? …ahhhhh!” Back at ADAM’S house, Ad himself was carefully testing out the strange formula. “Hmm. . considering the bio-chemistry, and considering I don’t know what I’m talking about, I’d say this would help the body in some way if consumed. But I don’t know… WHOOPS!” CRASH! The test tube crashed to the ground. “No, Muttface! Don’t drink it!” There was a brilliant flash of light. “YIP! YIP!” went Muttface, “What is going on here? My brain feels like it’s the size of Little Tokyo Town!” Adam had just turned his dog into a mutt version of Mr. Ed!   CHAPTER FIVE (ripped) “You can talk? “What (rip) “Um. . do you know math?” asked (rip) The square root of 16 is 4. 999 x 999 (rip) “Totally amazing!” “Want to see me (rip) his dog, whose real name is Isis (rip) ran out of Adam’s path and tripped him. (rip) Meanwhile, on the playground…. “Okay, (rip) “Yeah. But I escaped from prison, to, uh, (rip) Heh, heh, until it goes KA-BOOM!” The two laughed, (rip) gasped. He couldn’t believe what he just overheard. An escaped convict was going to blow up the school!   CHAPTER SIX A STARTLING CLUE Ryan Purcell ran to tell people about the plan. After school, most of the kids got together to search for clues. “Wait!” said Muttface, “I just got a brilliant one! Did you check for fingerprints on the gun to see who that guy hiding in the shadows was??” “I’ve been outwitted by a dog,” said Adam, “Great idea! Want a Milk Bone?” “Got a Manwich? Or maybe watermelon?” After the kids brought the gun to some dude. “Well, the fingerprints don’t match any of the people’s ya gave me, uh. . do you want to give me yours? People double-cross, you know!” They did. “No, I’m ‘fraid not. Got anyone else’s?” “Yeah, Matthew and Anthony’s. Here, I always keep ‘em. I doubt it’ll matter, though. ” “I got it! It’s Anthony. . that kid you were talking about!” The kids couldn’t believe it. Anthony was framed before– is it true again? Or did Tony really go bad? Everyone went home- silently. They hoped the next day would bring a new clue- to Anthony’s innocence. “Oh, you and your big mouth, Isis!” ‘said’ Adam, “Now look!” “Gimme a break , man, if a dude is bad, it’s not my fault! It wasn’t your fault when Baddokid turned bad. You told me stories. You were friends for awhile. ” “Huh?” “Well, you weren’t exactly enemies. ” “I can’t even agree to that. But please don’t change the subject. I thought the mystery about Anthony had ended! But I guess it’s just the beginning. . ” Elsewhere. . in an almost abandoned warehouse on James Street… “Great plan, Baddo… working together! We can take ‘em! When did you want to blow up Selser School?” “At 10:00. . when everyone’s inside. . including, you know. . ” “Yes. . the kids!” “How was your spying going?” “Oh, fine. . ” “Do they trust you?” “They have no suspicion. . those dummies!”   CHAPTER SEVEN WIRE-TAPPING When I left off. . oh, forget it, let’s continue! The next day, at school, the custodian was giving an interview to Amy Cote. “What past experience do you have?” “Um. . I went to school until I was 16, and, duh, I, uh, are you gonna edit? Because… forget it. You kids drive me crazy. So get your face outta here! MOVE IT!” “Okay, so that was you went to Harvard and work as an assistant doctor for 5 years?” “OUT!” “Okay! Don’t have another cow!” After school. . “Okay,” said Adam, “I can help thinking that Baddokid has something to do with this. So, if we can tune our radios into the frequency he uses his kiddie walkie-talkies on, we can listen to his conversations!” “What do we tune ‘em in to? Do you even know?” “9. 11” After a couple minutes, the kids were listening to Baddokid’s conversations. “Okay, Bras, he sent Anthony back, so if somehow Adam and co. gets in on us, he’ll be to blame. Got it?” “Got it. Do you want me to turn on the wiretap alarm?” “There isn’t one! Only one to warn us if someone’s listening. ” “Want me to put it on?” “No need for now. Listen, Bras. . ” “It’s Brad. ” “Oh. . Brad. Well, I say we do it tomorrow. We already postponed it. And we can watch Selser School go ka-boom!’ ‘Duh, acting like I’m a custodian really fooled them, not dat I really needed to. Uh. . what were we gonna do again?” “You nincumpoophead! We already set the bomb in the dumpster! Remember?” “Oh, yeah!” Adam turned off his radio. “I’ve heard enough. Let’s go. NOW!” Needless to say, the kids moved the bomb to Baddokid’s hideout. (They heard where it was on the radio) Baddokid was not inside at the time. “Woof!” yelled Adam. “Woof?” said Muttface, “Get real!” ALL RIGHT! THE BOOK IS FINISHED! AND I’M NOT EVEN IN FIFTH GRADE WHEN I’M WRITING THIS! LET’S PARTY! COWABUNGA! "

Before we focus on the sixth grade, we’ll for the first time see how the kids are doing in August. “Hey, Muttface, what beach did you say we were going to?” It was Anthony. He was visiting Isis at her huse. “Oh, a quaint little beach in New Hampshire. . Crapton Beach. No humans allowed. ” “But other dogs can’t talk!” “I created it. ” “Oh. ” “Hey, gang!” said Adam, “What’s up?” “Hey, Ad! Been fighting a lot of crime?” “No, not really,” replied Adam, “It’s been a slow summer. ” “I still can’t believe you got Isis her own house!” “Well, she’s become my financial advisor, and…” “Egad!” yelled Muttface, “I’m naked!” Later, at Crapton Beach… “Nice place, eh, boys?” said Isis in her bikini. “Yecchh!” saif Adam, “This place should be called Ton Of Crap Beach!” “Last one in the beach is a rotten. . ow!” yelled Adam as he ran to the water, but tripped on something along the way. “Ow! What was that?” asked Adam, half-buried in the sand. (Editing note: the rest of this book is missing. ) "

    "title": "Kids #4: The Punishing Avenger of Selser (Fifth Grade Series) (1991)",
    "body": "CHAPTER ONE PUNISH AND AVENGE We left Adam (yes, Adam, not Mr. Video) on the school grounds after losing his powers as Mr. Video to an alien named Bluberbrainiac. His dog could now talk and is called “Mufface”. Now, a bunch of big brats were before Ad, Tony, Muttface, Ryan Moore, and even Charles! (All will be explained) “Well, lookey here!” said Daniel Boogers, “If it isn’t Adam ‘Madam’!” “Don’t worry, dudes!” yelled a voice, “I’ll beat up these bad dudes!” Out of the shadows appeared… Matthew L. ! In a COSTUME! “Prepare to face the wrath of the Punishing Avenger!!” The Avenger put one jerk in a headlock, and then kicked him to the ground. Another he burnt with some kind of ray. And it went on until all the bad boys were gone. “Well, Mr. Video, what do you think?” “I’m not longer Mr. Video. ” “Oh. Here’s my story! Listen! You got sucked into a television, I was sucked into a Marvel comic book! And I became… THE PUNISHING AVENGER!!!” “Tell me more after, but it’s my turn. I was up against… CHARLES! HE ESCAPED! Well, um… okay. But I was up against Charles, and I was sucked aboard an alien spaceship with my talking dog, Anthony, Ryan Moore, and Charles. I met the alien Bluberbrainiac and played a game of Nintendo with him. I lost, so he took away my powers as Mr. Video. You’ve got to help me get my powers back!!” “I will!” yelled the Avenger. “Shut up, wimp!” yelled a voice from behind. “What the…” stuttered Anthony, “Who the heck are you?” “I am Daniel Boogers!” announced the figure, “And I shall see you again!” “Wow!” Wow. Amazing. Sorry. Did you know that everything I write is true? Of course, that might not be true, because I can easily lie about that. Did you catch all of that? No? Get your brain into hyper gear. That night, Adam (I hate saying that) went to sleep. In the middle of the night, though, he spotted a DARK figure in the living room. A thief! Adam springed up and into the living room. The thief knocked Adam aside. Then, the Punishing Avenger jumped in through the window! “Where’d you get my address?” “When you were Mr. Video, you gave me your card,” answered the new super hero. The Punishing Avenger whipped out a machine gun. “Go ahead. Make my night. ” The thief ran away, screaming. “Was that loaded?” asked Adam. “You bet,” said the Avenger, “Say, man, you wanna go shoot squirrels and environmentalists tomorrow morning?” “Leone! You’ve changed!”   CHAPTER TWO VIDEO POWER… YEAH, THAT’S RIGHT. Adam had written to the video game show “Video Power” before his powers had been taken away as Mr. Video. One morning he received a letter saying he had been accepted! The other contestants were the Punishing Avenger, Ryan Moore, and Charles Lummingham. (I wonder who that might be in disguise…?) “And now, here’s the guy who introduced Mr. Rogers to Mr. Coffee to help wake up his neighborhood, here’s JOHNNY ARCADE!!! Yeah. ” “Thank you Terry, and thank you Steve! Well, I’m going to kick Castlevania in the… chin, but first we’ll watch these rad ads, Chad!” “Video power will be right back. ” “So, Adam,” said Johnny Arcade, “Think you’re gonna stump me later on?” “I’m gonna kick your video gaming… chin. ” “And, in 5…. 4…3…2…” “Welcome back, you video game freaks…” Adam was ready to attack. He hated it when people called him a video game freak. “I’ll have these kids put me on the pot, but first, the Video Power Edge. Okay. In Castlevania 2, to defeat Dracula, use the Flame Whip and golden knife until Dracula is as flat as a spatula. And that’s the Video Power Edge. ” “BOO! Everybody knows that!” yelled Adam, “You’re no Johnny Arcade! Hey! What’s your real name?” Johnny ignored Adam. Terry, the announcer, spoke. “And now, it’s time to put the spot on Johnny by putting Johnny on the spot. ” There was a noise like the good fairy chanting a spell. “What’s your name?” he asked Adam. “Adam. ” “That is correct. Now, you’ve got a question for Johnny?” “You bet!” In the Rat Race of the Battletoads, how many pillars are sticking out of the walls?” “How many?” said Johnny, “Okay. Well, I can easily tumble with your cold-blooded question. There are… oh, heck, I don’t know. ” “Yeah, I think it’s a stump!” Terry gladly said, “So you get the Game Genie!” “Lucky… just lucky,” muttered the Punishing Avenger. Everyone stumped Johnny. Except for Charles. He asked how to get past the first Gooma in stage 1-1 of Super Mario Bros. At the end there was a tie between the Punishing Avenger and Adam. “So, what do we do now, Terry?” asked Johnny, “This has never happened before. ” “Forget it, guys,” said a mysterious voice, “Those two won’t last long anyways!” “Who is that?” asked Johnny. “I am Daniel Boogers. Hi, you two! Remember me? I’m here to kick your… chin. I’m outside of the studio. ” The two ran outside. The guy was so… I think I’m gonna faint.   CHAPTER THREE DANIEL BOOGERS &amp; BLUBERBRAINIAC- THE RAINBOW CONNECTION? Huh? Where am I? Oh, yeah. Um… that HUGE guy…… Daniel Boogers kicked the terrible two so far that… it hurt. “Hi! Nice to see you!” Who was that? “Matthew Woods… wha. . ? You’re changing!” exclaimed Adam. “No duh!” said Matt, “I’m Game Genie!” “No,” said Adam, “That’s a video game enhancer. I won it on Video Power. ” “So am I. ” Is this too much for you? Matthew- I mean, Game Genie explained. He had played too much Nintendo, and was hit by a Game Genie falling from the table as he was getting a very small shock while turning off the television. This rare combo of events at the exact same microsecond created Matthew W. to turn metallic and gave him powers to do many things, but only in the normal world- not Video World. Fortunately, Matt’s new body came with instructions. “This guy’s too much,” said Adam, “I hoped we’d never have to use it, but. . ” He was interrupted by a refrigerator falling from the sky with the three in it. “Whoops!” said the second Game Genie, “A few seconds too early. ” “Well,” said the original Adam, “Now we know we survived this part of our adventure. ” Suddenly, Charles Cunningham jumped out of the building. “Master Daniel! Shall I destroy Adam?” The group of heroes were running back at that time. “Master?” said the 2nd best video game player in the milky way, “Daniel Boogers has control over Charles! That’s why he suddenly…. ” “Kill!” ordered Daniel B. , “Kill them all!” “If we want to break the control over Charles, we’ve got to hit his main dude… DANIEL!” yelled Game Genie. All the heroes charged. Adam stayed behind. Then, Bluberbrainiac appeared! “Oh, Master Daniel Boogers! I am back! Oh! Well, if it isn’t Adam, ex-Mr. Video!” “Bluberbrainiac! I know you’re under Daniel’s control! Find it in your heart- or whatever emotional body part aliens have- to give me back my powers!” “You…. I…. cheated. Here are your powers. I don’t need them to defeat you!” said Bluberbrainiac. “By my powers combined, I am once again MR. VIDEO, CHAMPION OF ALL!” “Gee,” said Game Genie, “Kinda dramatic, ain’t he?” Mr. Video rushed back into the battle. “Guys!” yelled Mr. Video, “Hop into my portable refrigerator time machine!” Everyone did. “Gee,” said the Punishing Avenger, “You know someone for 4 years, and you think you know what they carry around in their pockets!” Off went the heroes. But little did they know what kind of evil they were dealing with…   CHAPTER FOUR I’LL BE A MONTH AGO HERE IF YOU NEED HERE When we last left Game Genie, the Punishing Avenger, and Mr. Video, they were rocketing through the circuits of time. They traveled to one month before the big event. They trained every single fifth grade student in Selser to be a super hero. Their mission was to be prepared for Daniel. Daniel Boogers, the controller of Charles Cunningham and Bluberbrainiac. “Daniel Boogers,” read Mr. Video out of a book of myths, “The controller of evil. Able to possess absolutely anyone’s will to be his slave. Head-to-head combat is useless. ” “Great,” said Game Genie, “We’re up against a guy about as bad as the devil! We can’t…” “We can’t,” said the Avenger, “But after gathering every fifth grade “Selserian”, we just might stand a chance. ” Later that day (or before that day, depending on how you look at it) Daniel Boogers, Charles Cunningham, and Bluberbrainiac appeared in a fancy time machine! “Yo,” said Daniel, “Follow me to the year 2099! Or are you afraid?” Before following them, the heroes decided to go back to where they came from to get some weapons. They came a little early, though. “Whoops,” said Game Genie, “A few seconds too early. ” They set the time machine for five minutes later. They came back. Game Genie was equipped with a pair of nunchuks from Double Dragon 3. (Mr. Video gave them to him) and Mr. Video had a baseball bat. The Punishing Avenger already had a machine gun. The three soon took off. If the final encounter would be in the future, no one would be able to help! Darn! Into the future they went.   CHAPTER FIVE THE FINAL BATTLE! The setting: 2099. The final battle of good vs. evil. (Or was it? Only time will tell!) “Welcome, dudes. ” “Yeah! Welcome to your doom!” “Shut up, my subjects! You had lots of guts to come here. Unfortunately, this is where they will be spilled. Ha, ha, and all that. ” “I’m Mr. Video, dude, and no one can beat me. Nobody!” “I did,” said Bluberbrainiac. The Punishing Avenger’s heat laser took a lot of energy out of Charles. But it didn’t matter. Charles was now SuperChargedCharles. And Bluberbrainiac was Unbeatable-Bluberbrainiac. Charles flew up, grabbed the Avenger and slammed him hard onto the cold ground. Game Genie used a well-placed kick to knock Daniel B. off of his floating chair and onto a car-disintegrating machine. “AAAAahhhhh! NO! I gotta get off!!!…. . ” ZZZZttt! His control over Charles and Bluberbrainiac was gone! “Whoa,” said Charles, “Where am I? Why am I so big in second grade? Adam! You’re big, too!” “Charles,” said Mr. Video, “We’re both in fifth grade. It’s a long story. Very long. ” “Yo!” yelled Bluberbrainiac, “Why am I not at the video game championships?” “It’s a long story. Very long,” said Game Genie. “Ouch,” said the Punishing Avenger, “Like, the story’s pretty long, you see?” And so, in a bizarre turn of events, Charles and Bluberbrainiac joined the side of good. IT’S THE END, BUT MORE ADVENTURES WILL COME FROM THE KIDS… I GUARANTEE IT! (NOT REALLY) EPILOGUE: Later that day, Fishhead crashed into the ground. “You heard of Rocketguppies, the new kind of fish?” "

She’s probably snotty, anyway‑ he’s rich!” “That doesn’t mean nothing!” “I just don’t want you to dump me and go on a wild goose chase across Death Valley to try to find your dear martial‑arts jerk. Besides, he’s human, Codette! HUMAN!” “Oh my god, Fishhead! You’re right! I’m going crazy! Help me!” “Not in public!” “Then let’s go home!” “Can’t. I’ve got skydiving lessons at six. ” “Oh, man! Um. . let’s meet tomorrow. My place. ” “You got it. See ya!” And so, Fishhead set off to the airport for his skydiving lessons, and Codette went on her way home. Fishhead was madly in love with Codette. When he jumped out of that plane over Mt. St. Helens, all he could think about was those little cute troll dolls with optional clothes. That was hardly the thought of Codette, though. She was much too mature for that. She was saying to herself, “That’s not a stranger that snuck into my house into my corner (man, that came out wrong)… that’s just a coat rack with a bunch of clothes on it. Wait a minute… did that coat rack just fart? Nah. It must’ve been my pet skunk. Then why is it nudging towards me? Okay, it’s one of those coat racks that walks. Right. Are they supposed to climb on the bed? Guess so. ” And she just fell asleep. Fishhead was still falling. Codette was still sleeping. Less filling! Tastes great! “Oh, great!” whispered Codette, “I left the TV on!” She got up to turn it off when the coat rack knocked her out. Fishhead was still falling, expecting to hear a voice saying, “Welcome to the Twilight Zone. ” But there was no voice. Just a thud. He had landed. "

Twilight) contents of the jar revealed! pay the price of admission and see the insignificant wonders that are there to see… knife driven over and over and over and over into the difficult pickle jar, finally it could not withstand the pressure anymore. tall trees toppling over, domino orgy wondering how they could possibly have withstood the test of time apart, then reflecting upon it and deciding that they never could have and never did. force of gravity overcoming the initial driving force of the universe, child of beauty coming home to me. . i love you as you set it free, i’m wonderful as you let me be. funeral march playing to the elephant and the donkey, to the black and to the white, to the establishment of the obscurity. if you don’t understand that’s because it’s verbatim. if you do understand then it’s meaningless. you meat me down by the bay where the watermelons grow, but not in the command center of atlantis. and for this, know that i love you. There is no self but what one finds in others. . and if one chooses to deny theirself that privilege of unindividuality, then they can only seek to find solace in the one thing which can possibly be considered solely theirs- emotion . emotion being a convoluted stew of nonesense, to be arranged in whatever way. love is desire, love is an aim, a goal, an ideal. . to receive love is a miracle. . so you’ve found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts. . what’s so amazing about really deep thoughts? is that respect? is it that you’re starstruck so much that the miracle seems like so much more, and that the miracle coming from the ordinary soon becomes nothing? the selfish love of feeling good brings forth relationships not based on what the significant other is, but instead the love that makes one feel so wonderful. . making everything else seem so magnificently pointless, and yet paving the way for disagreement and separation. . and the whole time, making the other wonder infinitely. . how? i rarely wish that i wasn’t thrust upon this world, i only wonder at the futility of trying. it’s the trying that makes it worthwhile, as opposed to the outcome, but nonetheless it’s unlike the walking of a million miles for a crushing of the self and for the wonders of eternal salvation… no, it’s walking blindfolded for a million miles, knowing that somewhere along the line one will find purgatory. is there a point? of course not, other than that there is no point. is there a point to the point that there is no point? yes. satan nice, jesus masculine, jesus nice, satan masculine, it’s all in their perception. . but it matters not, for they tread the middle ground. and this is where the true futility lies! it’s simple to live with the concept that ‘tis all for not. . but that the rest may as well be dead, as they are already floating around with a dimmed sense of reality. . that they have antilucidity… and that it destroys lucidity upon contact and drives sponges to an early demise. you’re right next to me but i need an airplane. . i’m unable to hate i’m unable to want sleep unable to close these eyes out of tune with the rest of humanity so unloved inside loving lucid of my dreaming. the reciprocal of the reciprocal never equal to the original. the very act of reading a love alters its structure formulating the reasons why why there really is no why when you get right down to it. but just in case, a prenuptual sarcophagus that will help you sleep at night. never doubt the overall scope of my love for you, never mind the intricacies that would hold us down and rape us violently as the other watched and our innocence died. though in my mind i am gagged, in my mind is my voice. the facts are never truly plausible… domino orgy sticking its fingers in its ears and trying desperately not to hear us our voice our love the everything as we look around, having found another nothing to wish for, nothing to want. but share with the dead as we refuse the ankh pacifiers shoved in our faces. if you’re giving in then you’re giving up. real to you, facade to others. the propaganda of the dark enlightenment thrust upon us while bibles are the truth in hotel rooms only if they’re truth in the home. if customer is ever wrong, see rule number one. you’re right next to me but i need an airplane. . i’m unable to hate i’m unable to want sleep unable to close these eyes out of tune with the rest of humanity so unloved inside loving lucid of my dreaming. the reciprocal of the reciprocal never equal to the original. though in my mind i am gagged, in my mind is my voice. the facts are never truly plausible… domino orgy sticking its fingers in its ears and trying desperately not to hear us our voice our love the everything as we look around, having found another nothing to wish for, nothing to want. but share with the dead as we refuse the ankh pacifiers shoved in our faces. if you’re giving in then you’re giving up. real to you, facade to others. never doubt the overall scope of my love for you, never mind the intricacies that would hold us down and rape us violently as the other watched and our innocence died. will it matter even if these are simply the ramblings of a madman, as are the ramblings of the mad leader of the free world or the mad rock star who speaks the voice of the found generation? don’t wonder why emotion overwhelms me, why i cannot simply reason, for my reasons are emotions. whose reasoning does the scientist subscribe to? what impossibilities of the past do the schools teach today? what will the catholic church change its mind about next? how many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop? be as generous as you are frank. i would love to say that i respect you as you respect yourself, but respect is nonexistent, and i abstain from what is mine, the rights inherited by class. there are no stories that can be written that have not already been written. and everything i’ve written is null and void. it sounds good, it looks good, but it means nothing. it’s crap. even the time when i mentioned how much it was crap? that was crap. you are crap. i am crap. kick me in the head and call us even. jam a red hot poker up my anus and call us straight. i wish you would come here so i can strangle you. i really didn’t understand the joke, but everyone else was laughing, so i joined in. letter from the editor. salmon swim upstream. nobody seems to like salmon all that much. love my flatulence, love the fact that i can make you feel like scum. only then do i love you. i’ll love you as you twist the knife in my back, and i’ll love you forevermore. though it frightens me as it invigorates you, together, hand in hand, we can go forth. . into the great unknown. together. united we stand, divided we fall. the embers shall never fade in the time where once. . once i was able to write of happiness and optimism. i can write of love, and i can be in love, and i can make love. but i shall never be able to kill love when it would do me the most good. the angst fades along with the thoughts of being unloved. to be loved to be loved to be loved to be just a friend it is wonderful. and the rest don’t matter. . i look. i often look. and i scream inside while i begrudgingly make eye contact with the love of my life for that instant. to turn left, to turn right, and to nod, and to stand frozen in the place as you know that the world is so deep a chasm, and yet so bare. . so naked. . so freezing in the vast winters, to love them and to know that it is real, to know that there is more to life than population control and free love. you know that einstein was a very nice fellow, but that when it came to the sciences, he was positively clueless. i want, and i know that they want, but the want is desire and desire is a slap in the face by the old man of purposeful sardonic inspiration, released by the child and fed in the forest by a pack of wild savages in business suits, all longing to get a piece of the sheep which the man must sell to stay physically fit and gain enough credits to graduate. wishing wishing wishing that the world as it makes sense the words are forced the words are real the reality is abstract as i attempt futility to add some sort of a bossa nova beat to the horrible obscurity. agh! and i know that it’s pointless. and i know that whatever i love is out of mutual disgust. and i know that if i keep combing my hair enough it’ll go the way i want it to go. it hurts sometimes when i comb my hair. . the snarls, the snarls, my hair has snarls. am i a different person than i used to be? no, but i are a different me than i used to be. do you see me? if you see me let me be me i am ME! salivate masturbate look at the other and turn around 360 degrees only to see me. and i don’t mind. for you know what i am to me and you know what i am to you. and you know what you are to me and you know what you are to you and the truth is we are all the same in that we are different. but look, there are more of us who are not trendy than there are those who are. and we all agree that your ways are wrong. in your face! mock individuality lived in the happiness/sadness/anger/suicide/orgasm of others, but we’re not. we know how individuality is obtained, we know that by being together the other is but means to an end, which is love of the other. love. anger crushed and destroyed violently. never mind that which they shove in your face, mind what is already your face beneath the layers of mellon collie and the infinite cream pies. to look to the future is an impossible necessity. it’s easy to come up with profound thoughts on cue. just look within. even if that in itself is a lot more difficult than it sounds. this is the first song i’ll sing for you, mute though i once thought i was, newfound though the voice i now attempt to sing with is. please excuse the mess, we’re renovating to better serve ourselves. i am loving it i am loving it for as you skim as you pay as close attention as you ever possibly could i am one. i am one with my duality, and it forgives my individuality as the beautiful river gives way to a beautiful waterfall. . beautiful until the world crashes loud upon the cement for the little billy corgan that could’ve, should’ve, would’ve, if only his reality had not been brought to a swift end by the eternal conglomerate city of his intoxicated father. organic fingers clutching newfound sheets… insecurities a thing of the future. more of you more of me more of us. . why? parce que le soir est notre amour et notre fin… et le crépuscule est maintenant. dorian gray was a cheese-loving smurf…. wishing for a world devoid of quantum theory, a static world without static cling… now existing within himself, paper clips melted in a large pot and bent into the shape of hearts, the cords of countless toasters peeking their way out of the garbage pail. hold me as i once held my pancreas, to remember and to never again care, to lose ourselves in the dream of lucidity. relax your body, relax your soul as the soma corrupts and entices you in a way that nothing else can. give what you will for the cause, laughing at the insect corpses that finally got the hint… hit in the head with a golf club and pleaded with, until we attempted to love them and they scurried away of their own free will. make sure the bugs remain dead at our naked feet as we possess ourselves in the beautiful melody that is. . everything. and once again i feel it as i re-reiterate that i feel so naked, and it’s wonderful, the pain is something to know, such a brave young soldier armed against a world of independent thinkers. i look and i think and the beat’s going on i scream and i climax for so very long i wonder i plunder i harvest and kill i bleed and i maim and i slaughter until i know that it’s pretty, i know that it’s bright, i know that the longing can sleep for tonight. to always be happy to never be satisfied knowing the truth as it stains and it stops and it dies and i wonder i think i say why and i ramble and gamble though they may speak reflectively of the future tense though the gerunds may be irregular extraterrestrial life is truly possible as the tears swell up in my eyes and i cry out to the dead corpses of the once-glorious gods and they refuse to answer me refuse to help me as war and famine and pestilence and death death death death enlightened by pain as i’m fucked to the limit and my account has been logged off for my safety and the 21st century looms in the past and in the 1920s they didn’t have trains and when the first atomic bomb was created i’m sure everyone had the same silly doubts as they do now as i passionately kiss them to the grave. a simple smile from me can kill you, you know. . do not look directly into me. i might explode again at any moment, pardon my stickiness. i can hardly control myself pertain to myself as i write this down as in my head in the world in binary digits to be uploaded to the same ftp server, same fad, new precedent. and yet i’m still the horrible 15 year old boy who flips off the mirror in a brash expression of his incurable love for himself. i am not levi, and yet i’m adam. love us if you will, hate us if mommy tells you to. destroy us in your mind if you will, you’ll find soon that there’s nothing left to take. the personality welfare checks might run out at some point… only then will you search for individuality. . or kill yourself. or start over again, forgetting that you ever ran the course before, over and over ad nauseum, until the guinness book of world records is sick of hearing about your incessant love of madagascar. the black wings just reach out to me over the distance. the white wings protect me here with a cloud of haze as i turn the page of the script and wonder why i signed a contract to say such recycled garbage. i wonder why sam malone didn’t just leave his damn bar and get a life. i wander within myself until i wind up tripping along a pressure point and become so much more the introvert extrovert. i wander within herself and i trip along a pressure point and both of us refuse to notice. and once again i think i know why my mind continues to wander over the same five songs over and over, and i know that it’s because these thoughts don’t have those stupid annoying guitar solos that existential cacas do. i wanted to rape the blarney stone, but then i found i respected it too much and i just couldn’t do it. so i raped everyone else within the immediate vicinity. ask the man on the pedestal what it’s like to have all of your desires surrounding you, having no sadness or hatred to let out, only outstanding happiness and joy to spread. he will tell you that it’s better, that the thoughts of poetic death are nothing but silly ideas. what is the point of this garbage i’m spewing at you? what is the point of adding the pointless to that whose only point so far has been to allow you to relate, while never really knowing truly, for you could never experience, never touch, never feel the aura of the presence of another human being, another mover, another shaker, another disco dancer who finally realizes how silly disco dancing is and takes off to wander the streets, alone and unmourned. lightning cackles around him as he wipes a tear from his eye and jumps off a bridge, the silent echo his only way of realizing that everything is gone, that as he is falling, limbs swinging wildly in the wind, as he splashes into the water at an acceleration of 9. 8 meters per second squared, as he is still standing on top of the bridge silently crying and wishing he looked as good in a trenchcoat as that detective guy on tv did… he is completely and utterly alone… and he would never throw that away for anything in the world, or beyond. i love you and know you love me. . and i’ll kiss you a million times and never get tired of being with you, always wanting you to be a part of my life, always wanting me to be a part of yours…. dollar sign im underscore off, it’s coming up, it’s coming back. bubbling over with youthful energy at how wonderful it is to be one again. never wanting to live and let live, live and let live, knowing why people don’t want to be loved… please don’t take this the wrong way, nothing i say is ever true, know what you know in your heart as i don’t. i can never i’ll never i’m never… i’m dead. i’m gossiping about you, and you should do the same in my situation, and there’s something wrong with you if you don’t know why you shouldn’t do that. i’m going to hate you and everyone else is going to hate you and the world is going to hate you because you can’t write you never could write no one can write unless it’s of betrayal. within betrayal is the loving that you’ve seemed so preoccupied with. nuh-uh infinity plus one equals the omnipresent collective mind that breaks down your door and decides what it’s going to say after the fact. and the truth is hard to take. . and what’s fake is hard to break. . and the real is never real… kill the world, and kill the zeal. leave me alone please. . you don’t know what your nonexistence might do to me. there are others for always, since now, never then. . let me be, let me water and murder the men. sitting so close standing so close living so close thinking so close to lie to say that caring is silly to say i don’t to say i won’t to say i wouldn’t to say i’m not to wish to wish to lie. a straight face a dead face immune to the tears a face that’s devoid of the sorrow of years to detour to retour to remorse to dehorse TO KILL ME TO KILL ME TO LOVE ME TO NEED ME… and as the world waits by with bated breath, wondering what the hell the problem is this time, suspecting what it’s not and yet knowing what it is. . somewhere beneath all that seethes under skin. to regress to undress to want and to hold to consume the quantity, it once made you bold. to laugh at the old and the new and the bored when it’s new and i love and it’s love and it’s dead. it’s ugly it’s dreams and it’s fountains it’s plain i never once knew what i. . never once dreamed what i. . KILL ME BEFORE I KILL YOU. . christmas christmas time is here time for toys and time for cheer. . we’ve been good, but we can’t last. hurry christmas hurry fast. . want a plane that loops the loop… me, i want a hula hoop. . we can hardly stand the wait. . please christmas don’t be late…. . and please, i beg of you, really, don’t get the wrong impression. i still love everything. i’m still me. i still love you more than i hate everything else. . the only problem is, i’m lying through my teeth. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack. i’m not even thinking about any of that but i hate is as i want to be cleansed i am dirty i am dirty i am dirty i am dirty bathe me and wash me and bathe me and bathe me and make sure i’m clean please and don’t forget my testicles for they are too dirty for words too dirty too much rolling around in the chimney soot. i don’t know what i’m saying and neither do my testicles. my testicles are asleep. please don’t wake my testicles. thank you. apologize later. aaack! the guitar is acoustic only if you don’t wish to hook it up to an amp. any acoustic guitar can be made electric in two shakes of a lamb’s tail. . can i lay down? are you gone for the night for forever? will i see you tomorrow as you demean yourself and don’t mention the Girl because she’s mine and mine alone to rape and pillage as i desire among the unhappy ones the unhappy ones but i’m happy by myself as i so desire as you so desire as we we we we wee wee. ack! damn possers molesting fish eggs again! going insane as i scream the f word out to the crowd and no one seems to notice. going sane as i scream “love” out to the crowd and everyone calls me a faggot and refuses to let me touch them. parentheses are never a happy thing as they linger on and on throughout the oh so long nights. wonderful wonderful everything’s wonderful death it is wonderful happily wonderful great to be a hypocrite great to never rhyme great to wonder how the great can truly be sublime. I AM NOT IN LOVE and i never was in love, it was only a simple caress and the state of caring more for one person than for anyone else in the world. please excuse me if i overreacted. now leave me alone and cry in your fucking corner and let me die amongst the infidels watching you from afar and realizing how little we could have gained from this all. i wouldn’t cry i couldn’t cry i don’t know how to cry can you show me the way hey hey we got the beat we got the beat we got the beat yeah we got the beat i cannot lie to you. scattered are the remnants, i can never know how i ever managed to get myself into this neverending tos violation. denouement is an english word. rock music has nothing to do with rhythm and blues. and you must search to find the truth and the future and the knowledge that it’s better that time is your enemy and my friend and the savior of both of our truth or dare futures. nevermind the fact that that i never knew you felt that way that you’re everything i never could be and i was really hoping that the martians would kill us all and get it over with. bring bring bring. that you are, pud. you’re a fine and fit specimen. why thank you miss jaka, i try my best. pud puts on a seductive outfit and does a dance. pud is existing under a mask. pud is really a woman. pud doesn’t realize that i am meeee and that pud made me and that i am not and that i am not and that i like to reiterate reiteration as the millions ack the tired masses yearning to get free cinemax……i’ve always wondered how the end of the tour would be.

why me, pleads the man, permanent question mark imposed upon the end of each sentence which could have ideally been declarative if only he would dare to CARE, visions of the future spurned by the simplicity of the past. human nature is. ack. animals are better than we now, to be respected and loved more than the rest of our human race. ask for homework and you deserve to be killed. ask me why, and you are already dead. words have been destroyed destroyed destroyed……. . i don’t feel anger, i feel frustration. so silly to feel repressed, ‘tis against all that i am against. i am not a poet i am not a writer, i am simply god. god to many, so many, infinitely more in number than the small population of this silly pointless world in which i reside so much of the time. a is always a, but only in this fucked up definite world. a is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196197198199200201202203204205206207208209210211212213214215216217218219220221222223224225226227228229230231232233234235236237238239240241242243244245246247248249250251252253254255256257258259260261262263264265266267268269270271272273274275276277278279280281282283284285286287288289290291292293294295296297298299300301302303304305306307308309310311312313314315316317318319320321322323324325326327328329330331332333334335336337338339340341342343344345346347348349350351352353354355356357358359360361362363364365366367368369370371372373374375376377378379380381382383384385386387388389390391392393394395396397398399400401402403404405406407408409410411412413414415416417418419420421422423424425426427428429430431432433434435436437438439440441442443444445446447448449450451452453454455456457458459460461462463464465466467468469470471472473474475476477478479480481482483484485486487488489490491492493494495496497498499500501502503504505506507508509510511512513514515516517518519520521522523524525526527528529530531532533534535536537538539540541542543544545546547548549550551552553554555556557558559560561562563564565566567568569570571572573574575576577578579580581582583584585586587588589590591592593594595596597598599600601602603604605606607608609610611612613614615616617618619620621622623624625626267628629630631632633634635636637638639640641642643644645646647648649650651652753654655656657658659660661662663664665666 in the world of the wonderful indefinite. when i can, i will destroy those who usurp my rage, love those who are apathetic and make them whole again. one night, same as always. she loved me for my pancreas, for her hatred for her loss of her anastasia. like linus shoving his penis in sally’s mouth, it was… and i still ignore such things under the hopes that it may turn out all right… you will be shocked until you understand what i say for yourself. . and that most likely will never happen.   fluffy the tyrants enthused are the slaves   kiss me, for my mind is blank. . it is all stopped as i FUCKING TRY to get something down on PAPER. . IT’S GONE. . flee this physical world by experiencing all that it has to offer. . kiss me, for this is the greatest poetry of all, that which can never be shared with the idiot masses, never to be shoved in front of the children who don’t really want to experience it. may they never make love, may they struggle with the instructions for using a condom, may reality ever set in, may they believe that i forgot to place an “n” in front of “ever”. may they believe that i feel angry when the only one i can ever feel comfortable demanding anything out of is myself. a notebook full of cynical sarcastic cacas. a tickle me elmo tossed in the compost heap to rot. freed inmates staying in their cells because they want to, begging that they are not yet fully rehabilitated, and getting nonetheless thrown out into the street with nothing to live for, nothing to die for, no stuffed animals to hug like they had always had as captain of the football team. time has lost its hold on me, floating around. . floating. . breathing fire upon the hellspawn who are freezing to death in the cold emptiness of solitude. wonder why i squeeze you so tight… wonder why i cannot kill those whom i cannot touch…everywhere. funny how the wind refuses to blow upon my poor and lonely back. funny how my back refuses to support me when i would need it most. funny how we pretend we’re still a child when we’re simply adults, cursed to an eternity of sitting up straight and flashing a painted on smile to everyone we see around the office. funny how i never seem to have anything truly original to rant about, and yet i can still go on for hours about the same tired garbage that has plagued everyone from time to time to time FOREVER until they finally break and beg to the same old man for forgiveness, because they are weak they are weak they deny what is theirs. they deny that i have any talent and they declare that i am simply a hoarse voice screaming into the night constantly for more cathartic ketchup with my french fries. why can i not be literal? but i am being literal. . of course i am. i’ve said it once, i’ll say it millions more… if you don’t understand, that’s because it’s verbatim. i am a notebook i am a glossary but i refuse to be organized, and i refuse to be clean. i refuse to hand in assignments the way my english teacher would like them to be. how many times must i make the claim to myself before people will accept it as a universal standard? how many times must i scream into the night that i am not a catholic, that i never was a catholic, that my father was never a catholic, that it’s all just a horrible chain letter that doesn’t really date back to 1887? wind me up before you send me out into the oncoming traffic and i’m positive i will find my way across the street to the omnipresent child of beauty who awaits me there. never mind that i once associated the child of beauty with a thing that i don’t know how to rid of myself now. . when will i realize that it is far too much to ask of this world for it to send me what i truly desire and will need to get me going in the morning like 20 cups of scalding folger’s coffee in my underpants? maybe i would even be waking up in the morning in that case. maybe i could sleep at night. maybe i could move my hands through her hair and the hair would never really be there. maybe i could stand and whistle tunelessly as she removed her clothes that were never really there and exposed the skin that wouldn’t really be there. oh, how wonderful it would be if such horrid things could be so untrue! oh, how i dream of past experiences come true. . never will i lie to my god, never will i hug the rest of the world, never will i finish this sentence. gleeful is the vomit that comes out of my mouth. bile is something to be considered our eternal enemy. drops of water are human society, and we are in freefall. tell me how horrible it is to never have anyone you really like be willing to talk to you, and i will describe the loneliness, no one ever willing to pass a fleeting glimpse somewhere, anywhere, within your general direction. pages and pages will pass, and i will still be describing the same very moment, the eyeball is always mine as i stare and i stare and i reflect upon it and i love it and i know that it will never be mine. never mind that we could should WILL love every ONE else and loathe the rest of the world simultaneously and never once question the physics of it all. this is what your mother never warned you about, this is what television learned you, and learned you good. my throat is so sore, and i sit here in bed and i really should go to sleep. but i want this notebook filled and i want it to be shared and i want EVERYONE who has ever played the tiniest significant role in my existence to read it from start to finish and understand and dream and wonder why i like tootsie pops so much. the scum of the earth is barbara walters. i can’t quite move my hands into the right position for the E minor guitar chord. bruce wishes i would be nicer to him and wonders why i wish he would simply leave me alone. i have a pen and i don’t have a heart but i still have a mind and it wonders why why why why it has not bonded, why this great fusion is loss and why it desires loss and is sick of such gain. why must i crush the snowball when it comes time to do so? why do snowballs melt indoors? why don’t i just stop this charade and sleep like a good little teeny bopper. careening off of a plane, pondering the texture of jell-o and knowing that the nervousness is only infinite in a finite world, finite in my infinite world. hm, my pen is starting to run out. baker baker bake me an olive. bake it damn you! I WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY EXCUSES! lobotomize the antichrist with your sane counselors. terminate the inspired by siccing upon them the nameless, the obsequious, the beloved. the meaning of life is something that everyone seeks. ha! how a hypothetical creator should laugh at such nonesense, it’s like finding an objective in tensofmillionsofpeoplewhorefusetoshutupand letmewritejustletmewriteJUSTLETMEFUCKINGWRITE. but i digress. to wonder why vampires may never laugh and hum showtunes. . to consider how hollow their shell, how introverted their entire world. to wonder if i am truly an introvert or an extrovert, and to realize that they are simply words, and nothing more, meaningless labels, the likes of which have destroyed many a civilization. to only be shortsighted in that which i care about and need… to never bother to look at the calendar and count how many days are left until the end of the world as i know it. funding for this program is provided by? perhaps it is simply the question mark which is the driving force of my existence. to mix together millions of philosophies and to formulate a silly plan, the likes of which have never before been experienced on this mortal realm. . existential petunias the same as scientific petunias. only the ugly, the raw, can ever have meaning. but then you think, and you wonder, what defines “superficial”? or, more appropriately, what does “superficial” define? which is more superficial, the body or the mind? the general consensus of this world is that ‘tis better to love one for who they are than it is to do so because of their beauty. and yet who is actually responsible for who they are? what to love for? the answer for me is the obvious, to simply do what i think makes myself the happiest. to love those who can serve my needs. they who hinder my progress by their mere presence will not earn any significant place within my life. so who will i love? such superficiality it is to love one for anything at all… be it beauty, sense of humor, breast size, intellect. . ‘tis all the same! kind of funny to look at the rest of the world stumble around within a cloud of self-righteousness which is not even theirs. to look at all the paper which is still left to challenge me, and to sigh. my foot hurts. always. if i did not talk to myself when the voices came at me i would go insane. and there is plenty of time left to class this period at school. this is my notebook. these are my chronicles. this is all written in handwriting which probably only i could ever understand. numbers numbers to thrust knowledge upon those who find it useless. . how can this be justifiable? i sigh, realizing that it is so easily justified by laughing at the idea of challenging any precedents. if i had been around during the civil war, i wouldn’t have known which side to take. today is monday. it is january. i do not know the date. i am writing i am writing i am writing mindlessly, endlessly, reiterating myself over and over and over. thousands of brain cells dying as i scream “FUCK IT!” and throw my pen down on the desk of the one who lent it to me and plop my head down on my desk. why not look upon them with hatred and stars in your eyes, for they are not you and you are not them and wheat thins are swunky. buenos dias, i will never have a high school diploma because everyone has such a fear of education. precedents are the only things which are worth writing about. to place individual experiences upon paper in a manner which could never even partially echo the infinite meaning that once existed in each moment of such an experience is to play a beautiful symphony on a child’s keyboard and to expect a standing ovation. the present is the most meaningful to those of us who deserve to be reading these words. . but another’s present, past, or future can never mean as much as the present, past, and future smooshed together and explained in a way to give hope for the future by redefining the past and showing the present from an entirely new perspective. annihilate the beloved and love the unloved. spit upon jesus and finally come. . to the place where the world is not what you were told, but instead now the world that you’re being told now. i am an advocate of individuality who does not even believe that such a thing exists. i’ve loved, i’ve lost, i’ve lost, i’ve loved. such satisfactory things that could be mine if only there were no me to hold onto these things! music is the most beautiful distraction that this world has to offer to the lonely and the forgotten. to judge them who refuse to judge is, in my humble opinion, a horrible atrocity that you deserve to die because of. is the action worse than the thought? everyone wants to do it. everyone wants to write down that one thing that i had wanted to write down before i decided that even i didn’t agree with it, and never could. whom do i love? how many may i count amongst the most important in my life? whom do i have sexual intercourse with? what the hell’s the point of a pedicure? why ask questions when you can easily find the answer within yourself? the ideal society would not be one where no one had anything to be strongly opposed to, but do we really need to make enemies of our own brothers and sisters? the enemy, the only true enemy, is self-apathy, selflessness, repressiveness. masculinity is considered a good thing in this world. . how horrible is that! people wonder why i am so strongly opposed to sports. i wonder how they can support a thing that endorses the glamorization of putting time and effort into doing your best to crush others. my only competition is myself. if athletes were to help others instead of crushing them, no one would watch them. ESPN would not exist, and a world without sports would be an even worse place with the pathetic foundation we have set for ourselves in this pre-postmodern world. we would all be the outlets for the superiority complexes of the meek and the eternally not hungry. hello. to be curious about the inner workings of the damned. i am fun. how much longer will i last? i am happy. i’m better than you. i have nothing to write about because i forgot to do my homework. you all look exactly the same because i look nothing like you. you don’t know what i truly look like as you scoff at what i look like. my pen refuses to die as it runs out of ink. . stay in line, my indolent friends. get a word wrong on the vocabulary test and then use it in everyday conversation. george washington was the first president, but the first president wasn’t george washington. i remember feeling so captivated by that which i never really cared about as i came so close to it and make myself look like an idiot in front of it. at an event that was not even particularly entertaining. entertaining myself with the delusions that they could ever truly be human. though i still wonder how long it will take for my renouncing of the word “human”, to battle between what humanity has become and with the hidden potential that humanity has to offer. such terminology is quite silly, actually. . and yet i always feel that it can do so much for me, make my thoughts truer, make all that i say make just a little bit more sense. these words are the aftermath of my catharsis chronicles. these words are that which is empowering me, giving me the strength to do what is right in this world, even as i wonder at the ways i will continue my education, my mind expansioning. to never shut up simply because someone said so, not to care that they want to pretend the constitution does not truly exist for the youth of america, that the young are only symbols to be used to gain money, support, prostitutes, bad one-liners to use at campaign rallies. maybe this is all nothing. maybe this is poetic. maybe these words will be burned and denounced as heretical. maybe these words will be misinterpreted and misquoted as someone comments on the certain denouement of a fancy restaurant. it just makes too much sense to ignore. to be happy at the words which they could never understand, only to be happy at the fact that never will they have to learn. to be an idiot, to die, never to learn, never to stop laughing at nothing in particular. this is a high school classroom? one is not a pronoun that relates to these things which surround me, which i never could consider even human. poems about flowers winning first place. looking something up in the book because you’re an idiot. reading between the lines only for stoopid geeks. hi. i am adam. i can’t write this fast enough. i haven’t written enough. never enough. never enough.   cry, for you are the last to try contemplate all the dead rhymes gaining the approval of the public opinion and never wondering where the public opinion comes from kill it i live   they will never understand they will never desire to understand the poetry of a perpetual standstill, demeaning every meaningful word and calling it systematic because that is the only way they have ever known. curses! foiled again by the same old futile writings about futility. corrupt me please. i don’t know, to even live under the silly idea that i would enjoy convincing myself that there could ever be a point where i could convince myself that it is worth it to convince myself of anything…. it’s nice to encounter friendly people. and such a rare occurance, it is. not long ago i would have laughed at the idea of one individual’s presence serving as a statement about the world, representing the infinite in ways which words may never express. i would like to be a painter, then, now that i see the true beauty of such artwork. that something so pointless on the surface might be so. . sullen, smooth, expression never denying that which words will never admit. to find captivating beauty and to not desire, to wish only to wind up and laissez-faire as i scarf down another handful of artificially butter-flavored popcorn. to hate the idea of a period piece, but to enjoy the art of fiction that exists in the past, the present, and the future. looking back on the past and thanking them all, though i always thought the aftermath would be the same for me as it often is for others. to be reassured that i am fine and fit, fit and fine. to tell myself that i should make quite the incredible god. to know that i will control this world, to know that we will control this world, so that the evil will no longer be damned to hell. everyone else just drudges along, day after day, a few will be happy, but they’ll simply push it all away and deny the truth to be happy. perhaps i am the only one who understands it all and does not lie to himself, and yet continues to exist happily. and people will always believe that i am a sadist when all that matters to me is love. the seven deadly sins are the seven deadly virtues because they are not about harming others, they are instead about helping oneself. that the entire world is convinced that they are evil and everyone else is god is disgusting to me. i love myself and am hated for it. i love those who are nothing like me and i am considered insane. perhaps i am in fact insane, if the rest of the world can’t see that there is no difference between jurassic park, twister, and dante’s peak. to be insane is to not think the way others do. therefore i am insane. i admit outright that i am quite insane. i am so insane that if i could find myself someone important to share my life with, i would not hit her, nor yell at her, nor be jealous as she stayed out with her friends. i would not get angry at her for being herself, i would not blame her for my faults. how insane must i be, for i never “feel like i could just kill someone”. if i ever felt that way i would kill them. but that kind of thing just does not happen to me. i do not feel this way about anyone. and how i feel about someone is how i will feel about them for the rest of my life. and i really need a hug. and i feel the life being drained from me as i upload. . again. we used to wander around the town aimlessly for hours, she and i. and then she died. now i stay at home. the end. a pencil to write with. i was never extremely fond of pencils. i prefer to leave my marks in such a manner that they are more pronounced. . pencil is just so dull, like a background in the foreground. but i’m not writing this because i enjoy writing about pencils. as a matter of fact, i’m not writing at all. goodbye. i hug and i take a glance at the clock and i see that the period is almost over and in my mind i scowl and in this world i remain the same as ever. i know that i could be accomplishing something- everything. i know that the better part of this last summer was wasted chasing that which i never even wanted, hugging futility and simply existing for nothing at all. another thing to occupy my time with was such a spectacle to me. in a way the same is true today, that contact with other humans is possible is one of the few things i believe i have to be thankful for in this period of my existence. cathy likes to deny that she is a female. i like to deny that i am fundamentally the same as these things around me, the cdefghis that rule this world. so what is the point of my existence? it has no point. the entire term seems to suggest a sort of culmination into some single product, all that my life has to offer reprocessed into beef jerky to sit on the shelf next to copies of the national enquirer. my life will not be summed up into a sound byte for the six o’clock news broadcasts. my life will not end as my body is placed in its coffin and buried six feet under where it is to rot for the rest of eternity. what i will have accomplished with my life will have been something so intangiable that it will not be visible with the naked eye. i will be the one who walks into the costume ball wearing the masque of the red death, only it will be a masque of the dark enlightenment. and many will curse me, and precious few will thank me for my efforts. it is 1997 and i feel that this is to be an incredible year. . though by no means a simple one. i am god to the infinite, satan to the finite. i pretend i can think while they are around me and considered not only equal but better than i! BETTER! these worthless pieces of shit. . it’s hard not to let it get to me, it really is, when day in day out ‘tis all that i am told forms me, to be told what i need to know, but never to be taught. i know i know i know i have been over this before. i have heard love defined as a feeling that you could never possibly live without someone. . if that is what love truly is, i know for certain that i could never love, for i will always be able to live, i will always be able to carry on. always. and so will you even as you are rudely interrupted by a world of such sharp contrast to the wonders of emotion that had consumed you but one moment before. . and you harshly scowl and ask why you have been awakened (put to sleep?), and they forget and they forget and they forget but you can never forget as you know what they have done and these precious things those precious seconds gone destroyed as you wonder where anger and frustration come from and you sink back in but it’s just not the same. . never the same. and they return at your greatest moment of triumph wearing a dopey grin and doing nothing in particular. even if i had lived in the past, i wouldn’t have been friends with beethoven. even if i had lived in the present, i wouldn’t have been friends with myself. to curse them for caring too much and to scream but to realize that you’re not really there, that you’re time-traveling from one second to the next, a pathetic hologram whom they will never be able to hear as they fall into an open manhole and get devoured by flower-bearing teenage mutant ninja turtles with long flowing hair and a football with the words “i love you” engraved in it. i enjoy writing as it comes, but it doesn’t come as the pipes are clogged as i am distracted by all the otherworldly things that can exist only in this world. as i ask myself whom i should consider myself whom i should call everything worth fighting for, as one must always have something to fight for even as they need an anastasia to fight for them even as they sit in a buddhist temple clutching rosary beads and praying to elvis that they won’t fart and have everyone look at them. hello, i am adam. really. and i exist and no one knows this and no one understands this and my aura hasn’t had any answer sheets to cheat off of for awhile. hm. i need a drink i need something and again i don’t feel like writing but i do it anyway because i know i’ll enjoy reading about not wanting to write when i do want to write but don’t bother because i’ve written enough recently. to see the hair hanging in front of my face but not to suck it. to place my glasses on the table and to be able to see so much better. i think i’ve exhausted it now. i don’t think i believe much of anything now, except for the fact that i need to do something. i need to make something. i need to accomplish something. i need to show the world that their idea of “relationships” is disgusting and that satanists have good intentions but can never be free as they don’t think of everything, how they consider themselves satanists because of everyone elses’ standards and don’t bother to label themselves by their own. nothing is disgusting “just because”. i won’t feel strongly for nor against anything simply because everyone around me was disgusted by it as i was growing up. i grow sad as i think of how marriage and “relationships”, which are the same thing anyway, have caused such sorrow, such pain. “you must devote yourself completely to me until you no longer desire to care for me at all. it’s nothing or everything. one or two. divided we stand or united we fall. ” it cannot be let up nor down gradually. . no one has the opportunity to go through different periods of their life, different emotions, while still maintaining at least the lowest common rapport that they will always share. we’ve been told all along that we can only “love” one person at a time, that otherwise we are evil and must grovel at the feet of tradition. i, for one, will never do so.

something and don’t like it, or when there’s a piece of paper that’s resting in such a way that i think it clashes with the flowing of the shapes that surround it and i feel that i have to move it i have to move it i shouldn’t move it but i do anyway. i delete the opening paragraph of “labyrinth” for the second time and consider this take three take one. i wipe my damn glasses and hope i don’t have dandruff because then people will ask how many inches they’re forecasting off my head today. i clear my throat and i sit making eye contact simply because i can. i don’t think back to when i could never have done such a thing, i simply look. and you give me an impatient look and ask me when we’re going to get started and i say we already have and you give me a little smile and i know you know. i look past you, i look out the window, i see the clouds as they float by and they seem to be floating by at a faster speed than they used to back when i never bothered to watch them. you ask me how we’re to go about doing this, and i confide in you that secretly i have no clue, that i just pretend i understand the means to the end that already exists within my mind within most of my worlds. i expect to see that look in your eyes that you get when you realize you’ve been cheated and disappointed but really don’t want to hurt my feelings, and yet to my surprise all i see is understanding, as if my ignorance of these things is a virtue in your eyes. you tell me that you know no more than i, that both of us are just stumbling backwards down the yellow brick road, tripping every couple of inches but still gathering ourselves together enough to work our way back just the slightest bit more before we can fall back down again. i ask you why we would be traveling away from the glittering emerald city and back towards the desolate boredom of a black and white kansas, what is so horrible about desiring something so awe-inspiring, and you smile once again with that beautiful smile of yours, and you tell me that i still have so much to learn, but that i have even more time in which to learn it. you tell me that i have already rejected the emerald city once, and that unless i can carry myself far enough away from it, i will feel a yearning for it once again. you tell me that i have been slowly traveling in reverse ever since the final minutes of twilight finally passed. you tell me that black and white is a wonderful thing in a high-quality resolution. you tell me that if every tiniest electron is either a black or a white, that the resulting shade of gray is greater than any blue, green, and yellow hybrid formed simply for the purpose of looking pretty. i think for a few minutes and i look into you and you look into me and neither of us can find anyone on the inside that is not on the outside and for that we know it’s real and we know that for once there is nothing to doubt. i look out the window again only to see that the sky which had been only moments before a beautifully clear shade of blue had now become the darkest starless night i have ever before seen. startled, i frantically search around for my coat as you smile smugly and ask why i don’t instead simply stay for the night. i pretend i don’t see my coat hidden behind your chair as i accept your offer and ask for a bag of popcorn simply because i can. and i sit and i watch as the popcorn pops in the microwave, and my eyes never never once wander from the bag as it grows ever-larger, as the microwave tray rotates round and round and you give me a quick kiss on the cheek and whisper that you’re going to slip into something a little more comfortable. i stare at the popcorn until the microwave finishes its cycle and i notice the cautionary notice warning about steam and yet i hold my face directly over the top of the bag and breathe it in and feel nothing at all. i sit down on the couch as you walk out of your room in skimpy lingerie and stride seductively into the living room and i ask you where the remote is and if i’ve missed seinfeld tonight. you run your hands softly through my hair and i say thank you for the thought but that i always carry a comb in my pocket anyway. disappointed and frustrated, you stand up in front of me and strip completely naked and i look at you questioningly as you remove all of my clothes and ask firmly if i would be so kind as to have sexual intercourse with you and i say of course, and you look excited and lead me into the bedroom where i do as you requested, and in each other’s arms we rest, and for a moment i think that perhaps i know… that perhaps i understand… and for once i fall asleep contently, never suspecting that it will by my final, my permanent voyage into the everlasting realm of the infinite…………. . you are excited by the shock value as you stand alone in front of a mirror and you unzip your pants. you know that you will be making some sort of a vulgar statement about the vulgarity of that which is not vulgar. you walk onto the stage expecting the venue to be full but you instead find that it is five hours before even the soundcheck will begin. you count the number of chest hairs that can be found on your head and then you manage to convince yourself that you might as well round it off to the nearest hundred thousand when you write it down on your latest mcdonald’s application. you try to make another immensely profound statement about humanity but instead wind up writing a poem about a quail and suddenly you begin getting phone calls from the people who used to beat you up in the seventh grade as they now want to ask you if you’ll be so kind as to do an old friend a favor and sell them the movie rights for 2. 3 cursed magic beans. clutch your book of nostradomus, my friend, and tell me what every jumbled sentence means. . read quotations from the book you have never read and never will have any desire to read, and tell me how wonderful a book it was and tell me how i should read it sometime as you hand me a xeroxed copy of some cliff’s notes for it and tell me that you want it finished by tuesday. it’s beginning to look a lot like valentine’s day. . repressiveness is in the air. i can always tell when i am around one who is repressive, because they are always the ones who are drawing breath and circulating blood throughout their veins and their arteries. so you look at me and you touch me and neither of us will ever know if it is fear because it is not fear and what it truly is something that i can never express because it’s so easily understood that words could never express it. to deny everything and to deny all previous thoughts and feelings and to realize that to act upon feelings is a wonderful necessity but to place them through a water filter and to label them is a horror that so many feel they have no choice but to do. how many times must i scream at them that there is always a choice? there is… always… a choice. and people will laugh in my face and ask me what the hell i’m going on about as i explain to them that cain and abel were identical twins, that i am so close to reaching the tree of life, so close… that i will not do because i can, that instead i can because i do. that one may put misery on pause for several seconds while they answer the telephone. . is that the eternal solution? and if so, what is the eternal question? am i the eternal question? i am that which you question, i am that which you claim can be decided by the others, by anyone but you, anyone whom you have been told is so far superior to you. i am that which you ignore while you scream in the face of the one whom you refuse to listen to me say you do not truly love. and for that, you will always hate me. you will refuse to help me, you will refuse to deem me worthy of my unalienable rights. and for so long i have decided that i can not care. . but for now, at least for how. . i hate you more than words could ever express. and for that, i love you. point point point point do i have a point? ack i have no point and i have no ink and i have no issue and i wander and dream and i salivate justly and thick and and thin and i know who i am and i hip hip hip hip hippity hoppity easter’s on its way. leave me alone. bleed in your own light. stare down at your foot as it slowly but painlessly falls asleep and you damn it to hell and you damn it to hell for you’re hip and you’re hop and you know just what’s up and you know that our memories are through.   soft to the touch      rough to the surveying           hair hair flesh                nothing nothing glance the ever-obscured unobscured ever-intangible dead   i never knew i never knew i never knew i never will know i always will look back and i will realize that it was such a stretch for me to pretend that i could ever write. please allow me to let my superiority complex show, please allow me to stand there at the podium in front of millions millions millions piled in far past the horizon line, but binoculars belonging only to those seated within the first ten rows. tapping the microphone tapping the microphone test test test echo echo echo though there is nothing there to truly echo. millions screaming die in agony and are brought back from the dead in two and two, shamelessly trying shamelessly fighting for a piece of a pie for a token audience and watching the music videos to find out the latest trendz yo and exploiting them six months later. it’s so pathetic, so laughable, and yet the saddest part of it all is that it works. kill kill kill scream and i stand and i shake hands with every passerby and i can count on my strands of DNA all the people who deserve to die who were never born who will never be born because they declare themselves born again they declare me unborn they declare that they worship what they could never truly comprehend the place of other than what they’ve had drilled into their heads for the last couple millenia. again again for once touting that the buck stops here that i am a sitting duck that never never never ack die goodbye. . once upon a time a man was born. and as that man was born he had it he knew it he realized it as he was told to wiggle his toes told to do so and yet they could not wiggle them for him… he had to do so himself. and it was taken for granted, as it should be taken for granted, as so much should be taken for granted, the grass, the trees, the sky, for they are ALL granted and only an ill society could deny all of all and the from they and and and and and and independence was described as something that could only be accomplished if one had a shadow looming over them telling them what to do with their independence and that they were independence YOU’RE INDEPENDENT NOW SHUT THE FUCK UP BEFORE I KILL YOU SIMPLY FOR DENYING THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE INDEPENDENT BECAUSE I SAID SO! and they loved it. they all embraced it, for it was several notches above the sickness they were so accustomed to by then. and they gave their lives away and they gave away the lives of their children their children’s children their children’s children’s children. and they gave away the right to any future independence by embracing the idea of independence as defined by a new kind of fascist dictionary which had only just appeared on store shelves. and then a few a few some minds more minds than ever before saw and realized and longing for others longing to help themselves by helping others by having others help them saw and found and loved. zeroes and ones in an infinite number of arrangements for an infinite number of reasons, and they were free, and the man was born anew, and all was good. and then they tried try will try to take it away. and never will they do so. okay, fine. you know what’s best for me because you know what’s best for the lowest common denominator and you don’t know how to multiply but you have a calculator and that should do the job just fine. ack. congratulations, your public relations are fine. is the hypocrisy your own fault, or do we blame the liberals who wish for more DARE programs wish for wish for never look back prohibit never never prohibit only never never awake an example if only kill kill kill only make this world a better place and i can’t believe it as i am told by my mother to kill my silly ideas about becoming a writer, why don’t i get a job at blockbuster video? that’s all i’ll ever be able to amount to, anyway. unless i unless i declare that i have become what everyone else what i am told what i am told i should be i never could be and then i could then i would be the greatest everyday joe to walk the streets, equal to all the others, all the dead living never bo7rn hybrids of good and good and yes yes yes and then pay for more of the same beg plead oh yes please some more give me some more…. sorry, but that will not happen. know and understand and feel what’s right. and go with it and if it’s in your way kill it. play by their rules until they conflict with yours, and then do things your own way. . that, my friends, is my advice. this is the word of my lord. thanks be to adam. ladeeda i have not seen me in action. contemplate nothing my eyes do this weird funny thing against my will and i can’t control it i can’t control it and yet i am expected to control it. i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed my madness, starving, hysterical. but i am the best mind of the past, present and future all mixed together, and therefore i shall not be destroyed. ever. how tall is the tree in actuality? it’s amazing the kinds of illusions the kinds of illusions ack ack ack and i will be told to fucking dumb myself down to their level because they are the majority and therefore they are oh so much more important than i, for i am nothing nothing nothing. kill kill love love love love love hug kiss passionately and receive the same in return and sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh. gee adam, why don’t you like going to school? what’s the problem, you’re too good for school? haha. YES! i am far too good for this petty little educational system never never never nothing it’s all worth nothing fuck it all i am sorry if i’m unhappy but if you’ve got a problem with it too bad i’ll fucking blow you away with my fully automatic spitball shooter. die die die i am not whining fucker DIE! so i want to learn and i am told that no no no never learn just fucking get a job fucking 2. 3 magic beans cursed cursed cursed never will that cursed cursed cursed as a society should’ves would’ves could’ves and hanging them out to dry dry DIE DIE FUCKING DIE I’LL KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER goodbye… ding ding-a-ling ding dong ding dong. do you hear it? i call out with my nonexistent voice for my nonexistent friend. and still i hear it. ding-dong. the ringing. ceaseless infernal ringing. it’s music, it is. ever-present, ever-controlling. the bells are ringing, they hear the sound. i’m drowning in blackness. ding-dong. ding ding ding-a-ling. it controls them. the ringing is what controls them. ding-dong. everything is black, and i feel. . nothing. i see. . nothing, yet still i can hear the ringing. sigh. kill kill kill kill. so what. . i am adam. hello. what am i supposed to accomplish in life? i am to be myself. and i am to be happy with who i am. i’m already there now, i suppose, but there is always more. there is so much more to be found. so much life, so little life. so much desolation, so many friends. so much futility, so little compromise. grandiose ha-has. a convoluted stew, love it, love it, kill it and then wish for it some more. i am reason desiring emotion until i can actually attain it. tiresome. i am on the subway home after a long day at work. a long day at work. a long day helping out the things all the things all the dead walking rhymes and now you did you’re alone and you sit all alone and you hear a faint noise and you hate it and you curse it aloud but you were raised a lady and you are not insane you are not insane you are not insane YOU ARE NOT INSANE! you hear it and you hear it and you shove your fingers in your ears but you cannot stop it. do you see do you feel can you finally understand? that is me as i hear it and i tire of the stupidity and all i ever wanted was some peace and quiet and alone alone i just want to be alone till i don’t want to be alone for i’ll be lonely. lonely, disenchanted, as the world will try to break me but i’m strong, i’m strong, i fucking knew it all along. to say you will survive and um ack and um and ack and um and um where will my future lead me? oh to be a starving artist i will be a starving artist till i am rich and famous and i have thousands of admiring lunatic groupies beating down my door with a sledgehammer and screaming at me that i’d better come and sign their fucking autograph because they have a tape called polka party they’re not afraid to use it. oh, if such horrid horrid happiness could be could be but it cannot be because it is but a pipe dream as is everything i am what i am is but a pipe dream but i know that it’s real, and i know that i’m real and i know what is reality and i know just what is dreams. and i know that she doesn’t know, yes and she wants and she dreams but it’s bad and it’s harmful and ack and i don’t want to think of it demons alive and in bed and asleep for i must sleep alone and i like and i want when i think of the truth and her dreams and her dreams what she wants injures me and i don’t want it don’t need it underscore off. she loves me she needs me she wants to receive me alive and unmourned and i’m tied up with bows a meek shadow existing to her not to me but to me never there i was never ever there. i was never within her, never a part of her never never never never. simply a damn pathetic shadow and i wish it would disappear for it is tearing her us apart. and i am done it is done i am here i am starting to know and to want but to be so so happy and satisfied sweetly with love of myself and the everyone not them all everyone loved shake hands and give hugs, passionate kiss, oodles of noodles and garlic and bread. sally and susan are flying a kite, steven and allison loving what’s right. hi ack wish dream blah blag ick ack yakkedy smakkedy yin yang AAAAAAAACK! i write this down in a spiral notebook i am so so goddamn tired i need sleep oh please ack i need sleep i need sleep and i’m here and i’m dying my life is so through about ready to cry i have so much to do i know and i fear tha it’s all sad it’s real, real time and real thought and music this time. it……. is……. only…. . natural. i write this down faster than the speed of sound. feel the sonic booms love the happy shockwaves love that i don’t know what to say what i feel if you do if you know then i’m loving you so and i call to you let me know let me know now. i love in such ways that are odd, they are strange but i want and i need and i know. working and working, delusions and fears, desolate boredom, erupting in tears. know and to love and to conquer true past, ladeeda it’s all gone it’s in the past. maybe i’ll just look back upon all of this as crap. maybe i’ll hate it all and maybe i’ll kill it all. maybe that it has such a rhythm but that it was never intended to, maybe then it’s a sign from myself that it’s time to KILL EVERYBODY. i would consider this a fairly major roadblock, that what should be my greatest hour of accomplishment and spectacle dying and ack i know i know i know killing school because all i want is an education and to spread the word. this is so so tiring tired so tired you have no idea how tired i am so so tired. yet i cannot sleep because not cause i write but no cause i’m in school and that’s all and that’s all and it’s dead and i’m dead we’re all dead till we die. everything is swarming around me people are swarming around me surrounding me encompassing me and yet like a nucleus with the universe circling around it, i refuse to give in, i refuse to become a part of everything that is around me, just another meaningless portion of it all. these pages are already beginning to yellow and i am a bisexual but i am not attracted to males. i am not attracted period, i am not attractive period, i want to kill kill kill again isn’t that nice isn’t that fine isn’t that monotonous isn’t it time to reach into a new era? okay okay i’m going to try to write some more and i’m going to fail miserably. do you understand the labyrinth the labyrinth do you understand that i hold a bird’s eye view that you are all nothing that i am everything and that i am but a child and that that is why i am so much greater than all you pathetic adults because you have been crushed crushed crushed by the rest and now you waste your days away as another pointless mindless statistic. and you will always consider me a statistic as well, because that is the only way you know how to look at people. i can’t even get upset at everything that is thrown at me anymore, i just feel a quiet silent night, holy night. these are the most fucked up memoirs this world ever did see. and i’m proud to be the one to present it. while i was chatting online last night, someone said something to me that i’ve kind of had to think about. . “why be proud of anything?” it sounds like an incredibly christian question to ask, since pride is one of the seven deadly sins. . and yet it kind of makes me think. should i really be proud of accomplishment? i don’t really accomplish things simply to feel proud of my achievements… no, i work to achieve things for the ends. . if i want to take over the world, it’s because i want to make it a better place. if i want to make the world a better place, it’s because i want people to better serve themselves. and if i want people to better serve themselves, it’s because that’s the kind of society i could truly exist happily in. if people would know what they wanted and not waste time with others. oh, how great that would be. yes, spiffy indeed. wow, this is quite literal a writing format, compared to the way i’ve been writing in this so far. they all look the same they all look the same. isn’t that so sad? i mean, i’ve kind of stopped feeling the contempt and i’ve stopped feeling oppressed, but still. . it’s just kind of a numbing sensation. like a hazy dream of something you can’t really stop, something that you don’t even really wish to stop. it just fades away before your eyes and you shed not a tear for it, it vanishes and you couldn’t care less. sigh. grand it is, grand it is, that i am here and i am doing and i am accomplishing. i’m actually working on my writing, and i’m working on getting a source of income and though no one will believe me that i hold in my sweaty little palms the potential to be somebody, let alone the potential to show them the way to pave a way to a new enlightenment and become a great mind like all the other peter pans of the past refusing to grow up. i will come like napoleon’s rise to power for some, i will come like jesus’ rise to power for others. i will show them the concept of ideals, but i will show them that they cannot accomplish anything by working alongside the enemy and lying through their teeth about how lovely that dress is. labyrinth labyrinth stuck in a labyrinth. they are rats who don’t even like cheese, wandering around aimlessly, searching for nothing at all. i could understand existence without any goals, honestly i could. it’s only when they stumble around and are not satisfied with their stumbling around, and yet they don’t do anything about it that i feel upset by such a horrible waste of potential. and even then, as i’ll look at them for a bit, yes i’ll stare at them for hours on end and i’ll think and i’ll contemplate and i’ll pass judgment, when i tell them the truth and what i think and what i feel and what i truly believe, my verdict will forever be… guilty but eternally mindless. it’s not worthwhile if music does not make one feel happy. thought-provoking music is horrible and satanic and you must not listen to it because yawn. we interrupt our regularly scheduled rant about absolutely nothing to bring you something completely different.   she walking out of mirrors no won’t deny the lack of it i the insignificant die   you sit down and you look at the paper and you whine that this is worded differently than it was when it was spelled out in the notes. you see the question marked “raison d’être” and you peek at your neighbor’s paper and see that she also is looking at her neighbor’s paper, on and on and on until the last person in line the first person in line is the person on the other side of you, who is peeking over at your paper because no one knows no one knows and in stumbling around searching for the truth they ignore the fact that it is nothing to be spelled out in bold print on the front of the new york post, it’s something that can be found within. to switch between the affirmative and the negative, the whiny and the assertive. to be the introvert and the extrovert whenever one will better serve my needs than the other. make the decision, adam. decide what will be now for the next two years for the rest of your life for the rest of all eternity know know ah what an interesting COINCIDENCE. something just happened that made my decision that much easier. i am dropping out of high school.

    "body": "(4. Macocosm) hello. i know that most of you don’t know me, and i know that most of you won’t understand. and i’m sorry. i’m sorry. i truly am, and when i’m finished with you all you will be ready. i stand here before you all today not to tell you my ideas, my beliefs, how i say the ideal being should live. i won’t tell you which bands i think are brilliant musical geniuses and which ones are simply mindless ripoffs of everything which has come before. i won’t tell you how many licks it will take to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop. no, my friends, none of this i will tell you, for all of that is yours and only yours to discover for each one of your own selves. you’ve always seemed like a looming shadow cast over me for all of these years, you all standing out there in huddled masses waiting to hear the news that will affect your lives and never once imagining that you could ever have any say in it. forever i’ve seen you as you wandered the streets with your heads held high and your ego held low. i will be completely honest with you, even as i know that it will increase the feelings of hatred which i’m sure most of you are already feeling towards me. i don’t like most of you, i really don’t. and i couldn’t if you held me in a torture chamber or a brainwashing center, if you shut me in a dark basement with 17 loudspeakers blasting over and over the feelgood sounds of yanni. it’s really only natural, when you’ve always had such an effect on the simplicity, or the lack thereof, of the events that take place during every day of my existence. perhaps my life has indirectly been made better by your collectivism. perhaps this having something to fight for, something to believe in, is what makes me truly happy and my silly thoughts of love and kindness are really just what’s left of hours upon hours of saturday morning cartoons interrupted by public service announcements. but even if it means destroying that which gives me the reason to continue on, to have something to strive for. . i know that i have for once put my all into something. and that thing. . is you. not you as a whole, not the masses, not the statistics that you read in usa today. i’m not talking about the people who decide the people’s choice award, i’m interested in the one person who buys that one copy of the band whom nobody else has ever heard of before in their lives. the “you” i am referring to is each one of you. with the potential to stand up here, at this microphone, to stand alone, but to stand with others by your side. this is the world that i am offering you now- it will be a world where children will speak freely to the other siblings about the joy of where babies come from. the man who wears a neon t-shirt to his workplace will not be laughed at, nor shunned from the conversations of the others around. no one will think twice about the black man as he kisses the 17-year-old caucasian boy whom he loves. no one will wonder at the reasons why we live in a world such as today’s, for all of you will know or be prepared to find out. anything you want and everything you need is here for you to find. here. here inside your mind. and only you can untap it. never again should you question the integrity of your own existence, never again ask, beg, why can you not be as selfless as the woman who futily throws herself into the hail of bullets being fired at her only son? listen to me here. don’t nod if you don’t understand, don’t nod if you do understand. simply do. reach into yourself, look beyond the awkward feelings. don’t just go along with something because you don’t feel strongly against it. compromise is for the weak of heart, the weak of mind, the weak of stomach, the eternally not-hungry who look up at our president and declare that he is not a model american because he is just like that guy down the street whom they’ll forever hate because he’s an asshole because he doesn’t say please and he doesn’t say thank you you just know that he’ll sleep with anything he find that has a nice pair of legs on it. you don’t realize that you’ve given these people, these media-endorsed, media-scrutinized demigods, with a power that should not be granted to anyone- the power to become a role model, an idol, for your children to worship as a template for their existence. the lowest common denominator magnified for all to see. politicians will tell you that you as the parent should be the role model that your children look up to, that you should determine who they will become as they stumble their way through the same labyrinth as everyone else who has ever lived has gone through. i will tell you that they should be the ones to teach themselves values. picture a child who has not been told that hitting is wrong, but has not been hit as a punishment. perhaps they’ll hit someone accidentally, and they’ll see their pain. they won’t feel it for themselves, but they’ll see that they’ve done something with their own strength and they’ll simply be confused until they themselves are accidentally hit, perhaps by another child or by a ball as he plays out in the yard. he will know the pain, and he will know the natural sensations, he will understand, and he will have no reason to want to hit because the only outcomes he has seen from violence have been confusion and pain. this boy will not hit another human being for any reason whatsoever. he will be kind and follow his dreams. now picture instead the boy who is told over and over that hitting is wrong, but is hit himself when he accidentally does so. what happens then? he gets the sensation of pain as a consequence of violence, but he also gets the sense of accomplishment from violence. violence can solve problems that reason can’t, the boy will feel. and the boy will hit, and the boy will be violent. it may be argued that such an indirect approach to parenting would still be thrusting one’s viewpoints upon their children, because the parent will have started out with such things in mind, but all i am explaining here are the precautions to go through to be certain that they will develop as little as possible through habit, and as much as possible through experiencing the natural ways in which this world works. common sense can actually be developed through such attempts. . but common sense is something that is ignored completely within our current educational systems and our current collective mind. common sense. perhaps i should define the way i am using this term. the actual phrase may be misleading, since what i have been denouncing all this time has been the sharing of opinions without individuality of any sort. what i am describing as “common sense” are things that have been figured out for oneself without any scientific or moral reasoning behind them. that killing should be wrong, but not because the bible says so. would you like this? would you like to understand everything and would you like to have meaning within your life? all this time you have been searching in the wrong places for these things. all of it is within. all of it is within. deny that the government has any authority. anarchy is not a good thing by definition- and yet i cannot believe in government, because while it may have the consent of the governed as a whole, the governed as individuals are left to live or die as their “peers” decide for them. this is all well and good for one who has decided to live life this way, but who as they were born were given a choice whether to pay taxes and whether to take part in what the taxes go towards? we are forced to continue living this way because our forefathers decided it was the right way, and our fellow americans decide it is worthwhile to continue. what we believe has no say anymore. even our second amendment rights are destroyed as militias are shot dead with weapons they would never be allowed to carry. here is the revolt. make the claim to yourself today. let them know, and let yourself know that you will never again be controlled because everyone has decided it’s right. no one can make your decisions for you. so make yours now.

That) do you——can you————-please—– and i listen but i don’t hear and i block out the sounds as i insist that this is not possible, that it is all about being rational and that all i’m trying to do is induce a greater interest in myself from myself. and i know i’m right, but it’s too much fun, you know. . because i laugh as i spend hours pretending and never truly finding the realizations until i finally drop dead of exhaustion with walking sticks who refuse to stop poking at me.   a boy a pen thoughts his crushed told never never your thoughts are wrong write what you know fucker but be nice   to finally achieve happiness, one must first fail at achieving their most desired goals. i know the things that i want and i believe that if i achieve them that i will be happy, and i know that i don’t want what everyone else has that i don’t have because what i have is so much greater than what they have. but i am wrong. it’s not exciting to have it all, to know it all, to be it all. it’s not exciting… anywhere. no one thing is ever truly greater than another, the people simply take what they have for granted and scoff at the people who don’t have what they have, even as they desire what everyone else has. it’s a stupid, horrible waste of everything, for everything’s waste and everything’s garbage and every last glimpse of flesh takes me a little bit closer to what i don’t have. existing in a world that all makes sense and wishing that it wouldn’t make sense. being a donkey and slaughtering the bee out of jealousy jealousy jealousy is such an interesting thing now. forever i’ve thought that i knew nothing about such a thing, being centered around myself, knowing what i want, knowing what i need, etc. etc. only now. . i see that jealousy is not as it has often been described or portrayed as. the grass is no greener on the other side of the fence and i know it. but it’s different and it’s different and i hop back and forth back and forth playing chopsticks on a foot piano thingie eek eek ack ack ho hum kill kill pout pout whine whine complain complain how do you figure that i am what i am and that i am nothing and that what you want is what you get and what you see is what you want and what you cannot have is what you desire. all i ever wanted was everything. . all i ever wanted was everything. . all i ever wanted was everything and all i got was shit. sigh. ack. another one bites the dust. kill maim slaughter. . feel. you sit down reluctantly as they all begin to stare at you and you ask what this is all about and they tell you to spread your legs and that it won’t hurt too much. i have no daily doubts i have no daily pressures i thought i knew what was going on and i was just fooling myself some more, the same way i’ve always been. fuck, i can’t believe this. i couldn’t write a diary because nothing ever happens in my life. and i know and i. . i. . i. . i don’t want it anymore. now something new has begun. please please be there as i tell you that i love you and my nose grows to enormous proportions and you proceed to eat it up with a spoon. you thought you knew. you thought you knew. you thought you were strong and you thought you couldn’t cry. well, i’ll show you how to fucking cry. take this, asshole. taste the fear and taste the sorrow and taste the pain. see the crap that is nothing and i hate it as i kill the yak and the crowd breaks into enthusiastic applause. you can’t write quite as quickly as you used to be able to, can you? if indifference’s fucking murderous final blow could only consume them all and you feel your will being crushed in the second person everyday of your life. and you see the saliva as it slowly falls down past your chin and as it stretches out through empty air and as it falls onto her body and as she doesn’t seem to express much as as you know you’re just going to be another fucking nobody because you can’t make up your mind and as the saliva she feels and she wants and she… it’s not going to hurt much. it’s a fragment as you realize that oh shit and as it’s different and as it isn’t right and as it isn’t loss and as it isn’t the widely accepted fear of giving into the monstrosity that is human nature. because there is no human nature besides individual nature. i am so fucking insane and i am so fucking fucking and as our innocence is broiled as it is nice and as my argh and as my ack and as my yeesh and as my every word is nothing anymore as i don’t want anything anymore but to be lost for i can get out of shit though still it’s there and as the money stolen, to fuck over the little helpless zombies and i know i can do it but do i care? i use myself in them in it in her and as i am so lost i am so found as i am so antiprofound and as within anywhere anything it’s all just nothing. don’t listen to me, because i’m nothing but a hypocrite. think that there’s a twilight as the doggies pull the sleigh chasing the red red meat that’s dangling only inches from their faces as they want it they want it but when they find it it will be so empty. ohhh no. ohhhh god. oh i want the something i want to hug i want something for i am nothing but myself and though i am happy i still want more i still want more and i’ve felt this way before. don’t question it as i kill the ones whom i once intended to keep. fuck the neon neckties and kill the deadly plight. why must you cut me to the core? why must you cut me to the core? still 2. 3 2. 3 2. 3 3 and 7 and even better is when you cut it down to 1 and fuck it all except for power not to keep in mind the excess of the many and have no idea how this is. i don’t… BLOCK IT OUT bastard BLOCK IT OUT block it out as you unslit your wrists and you have no idea where babies come from because you cannot test your theories with the scientific method. this is great for writing shit, for truth is dead and gone. let me please i need i want i need i am i no i know oh god oh please oh no. i know i mean it this time i mean it this time FOR ONCE IN MY FUCKING LIFE i don’t know anything. i have to hide under the covers and i have to hope that you will come after me and i can only hope that you will keep your clothes on for that will be the only way i shall be able to love you until i can experience yet another mood swing but never harm you never harm myself never question never never. oh, i’m nailed to the cross and i am given a little kiss and for that it has all been worth it as i die a slow and painful death. how can i be green in a world of munchkins? how can i. . question the how? how can i have something at last? please shoot me, i want again.

    "body": "(1) This is new and this is different. sad songs no longer have any effect upon me. this is old and this is ancient but to me i can finally truly know that i’ve found the various cornerstones of the world, that there’s no longer any mystique left to this world. it’s an interesting point to reach, a point which is so odd to actually reach… even if the mystique is oneself, even if the mystique is based upon something that doesn’t even exist anyway. . most people don’t end up where i am now. . just here. . just kind of standing alone, standing on a pile of rubble that was my kinetic anxiety, which was stonehenge built on a sinkhole that served as a rocket to shoot me into outer space. things. . happen. and when these things happen to me, i usually milk them for all they’re worth rather quickly. . and i throw it away, and i look back and i tell myself that it was quite all right, that it just formed me into the human being who i am today. but the thing is, i’ve just always done that. every couple weeks i would look back at something i’d done that seemed so right at the time, so vital to the direction i was trying to head in at that time. and every time i would think about it, i would find myself disgusted by it, and i would say to myself, “never again. thing x was fine back then, but never again. thing x has no place in my life whatsoever. i have seen what it has to offer, and i’ve realized that it’s not worth it. therefore i deny it. ” the only thing i never truly thought about was. . nothing is truly “worth it”. i mean, honestly. i would experience something and i would become completely enveloped by it for a short period of time. . but since it just isn’t in my nature to allow things to go unnoticed, i could see the price i was paying for this temporary satisfaction. and i saw how horrible and detrimental it was to everything that i was and everything that i stood for. and i would always be right, as i looked back on these things. i was always right, and i don’t deny that i was. The only thing is. . pointlessness really is a necessity. one cannot work towards creating a lifestyle for themselves that is based completely around reason, simply because emotion cannot be created nor destroyed. . it can only change forms before being released. and emotion is antireason. emotion will find a way to be released, even if it’s in the shape of determinated nihilism towards itself. aesthetic philosophy is widely accepted as it preaches the stupid pointlessness of aesthetics.   What guidelines are the universal standard that i should look at as i measure beauty in one form or another? i can’t truly spot out the beauty in the things that i don’t find beautiful. . and the ugliest thing in the world to me would have to be myself. love is writing what you don’t know and never could know and keeping it in RAM and shutting off the computer frequently but always writing more or less the same thing whenever you turn on the computer because you want to. marriage is writing something and making it appear on the screen every time you turn your computer on, and not knowing how to make it stop doing that because your 5 year old put parental controls on the computer so that you wouldn’t be able to edit the autoexec. bat file.   It’s kind of silly when i’ll flip through a book of nietzsche and feel like i’m being talked down to. it’s kind of silly that i will grow bored when someone explains something in a long and drawn out manner, breaking it down to the tiniest, most exact words that could possibly be used to explain it with, and will theoretically get the idea across to someone, and tell them that these are their observations. . in a situation like that, the reader is expected to say “yeah, i kind of understand what this person’s speaking of. theoretically, this really works. this idea is a true breakthrough. ” you see, i find it rather difficult to write about things in that format. . because words, art, these silly representative ideas serve a tiny purpose, and that is to get across something to the reader. . BUT. . the things i write about don’t wish to describe a beautiful sunset on a remote island in the carribean. they don’t want to tell you what the aroma was like as the fragrant candles burned around the altar a small boy has made to his masters of the universe action figures. they want to enlighten. these words are written to point out a little speck that’s off somewhere in the distance, something that you see, and they want to whisk you away to see it… and they want to show you that you’ve been there before, that you’ve lived there before, that you’ve done horrible things there before, things that don’t seem quite as bad now that you’re looking at in the third person perspective alongside 20,000 other yous projected as holograms, each with its own distinct characteristics that are noticeable upon closer inspection. i don’t write to make you jump up and down jump up and down, i write to make you feel that it’s okay to jump up and down jump up and down, and i write to tell you that it’s probably a good idea to take a gun to your head and blow your brains out if it’s something you feel fully capable of. i write to tell you that it’s perfectly natural to shut up and stay in line, and i write to tell you that if you give me everything i want in life, and make me the happiest boy alive. . you’re still never going to get a passionate embrace from me.   There’ve been some times in my life when i’ve felt that it’s a bad thing to just eat and eat and eat whenever i feel like it, never ever attempting to hold back the cravings i feel for a nice, big ice cream sundae with strawberry sauce and caramel, all topped off with some delicious reese’s pieces and served with one of those nifty long spoons that they sometimes give you when you’re eating a particularly large sundae. but now that i really think about it, i should take the advice that i so often give to others. . i shouldn’t concern myself with bettering my physical appearance. . i shouldn’t care if my gut grows to huge, enormous proportions and can be seen from jupiter on a clear night. and if i don’t care about weight or anything, then any other reasons for not letting myself eat whenever i want to would really be just plain evil. if i want, and i can get, i’ll take. end of story. thank you.   It’s kind of amazing, but what we love is what we hate and what we hate is what we love. what is near holds no importance for us, because we take it for granted and it’s become such simplicity. what we hate on the outside is what we are in awe of on the inside. but we never want to admit to ourselves that something completely against what we stand for could ever conceivably be the same thing that could help us accomplish things by blanketing us with the silly and the pointless…   I don’t listen to what others have to say under any preconceived goal of either agreeing with or agreeing with the ideas they have to say. i really don’t believe that anything anyone has to express, any ideas that they may have been able to gather up in order to figure out some sort of order to the convoluted racetrack that we all only recognize on some other, subtler plane, could ever really have any effect on me. i don’t want to know the views of aristotle so that i can decide my opinions on his beliefs, i want to know his views so i can compare and contrast his own existence with others’. i want to think about how his life was lived, what his mistakes were, how he relates to the rest of society, what his life’s story may represent in our modern world, in the past, and in the future.   Irony is what keeps us laughing at the rest of the world. laughing at the rest of the world is what solidifies such irony.   As of this very moment, i’m completely disgusted with everything i wrote in “kinetic anxiety”. i think it’s sloppy, miserable, self-demeaning, and an overall miserable attempt at a work of art…. i lasted an entire three months before i reached this point. that’s a new record.   Once upon a time there was a small boy not talented enough to write any kind of decent fiction. he’d been writing stories since he was quite young, but for several years of his young life he never really pursued it at all, even as he told his friends how much we wished to be a writer. in eighth grade he began writing on a semi-regular basis, doing silly assignments for his english teacher about alcoholic squirrels and paper clips of death. he also began writing more serious works, but in the back of his mind there was always something missing in these attempts. actually. . a lot missing.   What he wanted from his fiction was not just something that read well, something with a lot of big words making it sound more intelligent than it actually was. he didn’t want to sit down before writing a story and just try to pick out random traits for his characters that would have no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the story. all of this always seemed so… empty.   Eventually he began writing poetry. at first they were just silly little poems, in the style of the nonsense he’d been turning in to his english teacher for extra credit… but then he started experimenting with the idea of actually writing serious poems. now, these things were never meant to be seen by anyone, but rather just. . experiments in writing. something new for him to work on…. . the first few attempts were disasters. he tried writing a love poem, but had no clue what love was and had no clue how to express it… he tried writing poems about sadness, but it always just seemed like paint being thrown towards the general direction of one specific corner of a canvas about two miles long…. until his poems took a turn towards the… difficult to interpret. these poems began as mostly garbage, as just a bunch of terminology thrown together that somehow, somewhere held some kind of relationship with each other, deep somewhere within his mind. these poems were never really about anything in particular, but. . they started taking his true dreams, his feelings, his insecurities, and giving them life, and somehow definite truth, by having them expressed on paper or on his computer.   Eventually it reached the point where he would write poetry about the way he was feeling on a somewhat regular basis. . perhaps two or three poems a week. and they would be about himself. . and he would look at them and really feel good about them. . but the only people he would ever show these to would be his friends from the internet… any friend of his who would actually be interested enough to ask to read some.   One day, though, in the summer of 1996, he decided to go all the way. he took most of his poetry and put in on his web site… and began editing it. not deleting old stuff, usually, and never altering what already existed… but he began adding to it. the only thing was, he had mixed the poetry together. . meaning, there were no line breaks, no separate stanzas, just words flowing. . and so he began to build around that. words, sentences, ideas. . just kind of floating around… ranting. this is where the first chapter of the first book comes from… various stuff, taken directly from the web site. and that’s how these writings reached the point where they are today.   Okay okay fine. i have nothing in my everyday life now. . again. and for one brief period of my life, i had something. . i had everything. i had things that i could write out and things i could express and reasons and reasons and more importantly antireasons to make everything just seem so… perfect. well. where now? i didn’t do anything with my everything that week. . i just kind of enjoyed… which i suppose is probably what i should’ve done. . but still… it’s kind of a shame how much i’m kicking myself about my horribly boring existence when just two days ago… just two days ago i actually had something. now there are a bunch of kids in the living room, and i’m sitting here with a cup of soda that i have to use because they hate it when i drink out of the bottle even though i can finish off a two liter in a short enough span of time so that it really shouldn’t make any difference, since once i’ve claimed a two liter of soda for myself it’s basically finished and done for. . of course, they also hate the fact that i drink so much soda, but i don’t really care. . maybe if they had any reasonable supply of food here i’d have something to eat to occupy my time and my tummy… of course, that’s probably a miserable lie, since i’d need something to wash down such food anyway. . even though it’d be really nice to have some food. i have they might be giants playing on the stereo. the cd’s “flood”. if by some miracle someone happens to have a they might be giants cd, it’s usually this one. i have four others, but this one happened to be in my cd player. it’s quite nifty stuff. hm. i’ve run out of soda now. they’ve already warned me not to drink too much of it, because it’s for everyone to share around here. . i guess they felt obligated to buy something, now that alyssa’s down, and bill, katie, ashley, and kyle are over visiting. . it’d be kind of nice if they’d feel the same obligation to actually keep those kinds of things around the house for us. . i really don’t understand why they never buy any soda, even though it’s the drink i love most. i drink as much kool-aid as i would soda, but i love soda so much more. . well, i suppose it’s most likely because i like soda so much that they don’t buy it… maybe they think that i should drink something more healthy than soda. . though i don’t really think kool-aid is exactly a healthy, get-you-going-in-the-morning-with-all-the-essential-vitamins kind of drink. hmmm… ack ack ack. well, isn’t this coming out perfectly. . book two of the yet-to-be-named larger work. . the “um, what the fuck do i write now” book. yay. hope you’re enjoying your reading experience as much as i’m enjoying kicking myself for having no talent.   I vaguely remember my seventh grade reading teacher telling us how brilliant it was that the book we’d just read had begun with “happily ever after”, and had ended with “once upon a time”. i find that rather amusing.   It’s kind of neat how people can look at someone who’s pointing out the stupid hypocrisies that can be found in our everyday society, and by trying to copy the successful originality that they’ve accomplished, they instead become what the butt of the joke originally had been, as they put words in the mouths of anyone who happens to come their way, never considering that there are some people, some things, that just are not horrible and disgusting and against everything that the meaning of human existence pushes towards. oh well. just a thought.   You know, people make things so goldarn complicated for themselves. i mean, come on, i could yell at the television screen for a half hour as that guy from charles in charge tries to juggle between two dates that he’s set up for the same night. i can just yell out to him, “what the fuck’s your problem?! neither of them obviously hold any significant place in your own little world, if all you want to do is get through the night without having to lose your sense of invincible masculinity… if they don’t want what you have to offer them on an individual basis, ignoring your relations with any other human beings as they well should, then they should be let free to find the kind of human being they would be compatible with- or, more likely, would be more convincing when they pretend that they’re compatible, when all they really want is the silly adrenalin rush that they can feel when they can look a woman in the eye whom they would usually feel weak and nervous around. . when they can just say, ‘hey, i’m one helluva stud, i got this gorgeous girl and i don’t have to worry about nuthin’ cause no one can touch me. i’m god’s gift to women. ’ and i know those girls would absolutely love that kind of phoney guy, because no one nowadays seems to appreciate honesty very much. . all they wish for is the feeling of perfection, they want to know that they’ve lived up to their potential, that they’ve found their place as a servant to this world. you don’t even live up to those standards of idiocy, because you can’t even restrain yourself well enough to keep some sort of order to your fledgeling dreams of normality!” i know i would never be attracted to the “beautiful” women that charles would die for, and that the crowdthatdoesntevenexist loves to scream out “woo!” for. because i can look at those synthetic beings, and i can realize that makeup is the ugliest, most disgusting thing in this world. . that big breasts must be kinda neat just to play around with and watch go jiggle jiggle, but that they’re otherwise really just fatty tissue that gets in the way… i can see that these women have no direction, no purpose, not even any satisfaction or initiative in theirself, and that they’ll be worshipped by the rest of the world for just that reason. but i know that love is friendship and friendship is love and that if you think you have one without the other you just have a pathetic shadow that you’re holding onto, dragging its physical self along for the ride. so i just say. . follow your heart where such matters of the heart shall lead you… and follow your mind as it leads you to the path of greater love and hope and, overall, happiness. and most importantly, don’t bother yourself with watching charles in charge reruns. it’ll just wind up pissing you off.   I have been online for 365 minutes, but i haven’t actually been doing much online during that time. i was watching some television a little earlier, and tv nation was on, a wonderful show, i quite enjoyed watching it. then the daily show came on, and it’s sometimes amusing, but often kind of disturbing when one thinks about just how much they just don’t get. it’s kind of sad and demeaning to myself when i actually just lie down on my bed and watch some television. i shouldn’t be allowed such opportunities. . i think it means that i’m not trying hard enough when i actually have time to waste watching episodes that i’ve already seen and not really thinking much about the fact that i already know what’s going to happen next. . instead i just kind of veg along with the passenger train that’s heading for a cliff that’s kind of hard to notice, mostly because the scenery just before it is really beautiful and lined with cute fluffy bunnies. i don’t know, what do i really have to work on to kill all of my lazy time? i mean, it’s wonderful when i have time to kill by sulking or loving or doing any of those other matters of emotion, since that’s kind of a necessity. . but when i watch tv, most of the time i just might as well be sleeping, because my mind is sleeping, and my heart is sleeping, leaving only what most people govern their lives by to take in whatever program happens to be on at the time.   I wonder what kind of a sick human being could actually consider robert frost a decent poet. i wonder if they’d find his works as beautiful if they were about fucking dogs. . um, well, actually, i don’t wonder that for very long. . i think it’s rather obvious that the most preferred is the pseudoromantic, without anything to actually be opposed to, and therefore without any of the complexity that romanticism offers. . robert frost fans don’t wish for their mind to race with all the wonders of that which gives them such joy. . instead, they want some stability, and they want to be stable in something that won’t upset them. . so they want to read about how beautiful a field of flowers is in the springtime.   Some people wonder why kurt cobain killed himself, when he had everything he’d ever wanted. . when he’d reached the point that millions of others dream of every day. . stardom. . it’s something that’s become so important, the driving force behind the existence of so many angst-ridden teenagers. that everything could be. . all right. that they could flip off the people who’d ridiculed them and called them slackers, that they could do whatever they wanted. . the only thing was, when kurt cobain reached that point. . he had nothing more to want… i mean, honestly. . people so often will live wanting to accomplish something. a lot of people don’t even get going on this. . they’ll just sit around. . wanting. and they won’t be willing to work for it. but even the people to get to work on reaching their dreams. . what are their dreams? again i must question the terminology i’ve used for a long time without really considering the true meaning of. . dreaming. they don’t want not to be hungry. . they just want cheese. they don’t want for any reason other than having some meaning… something to want. it’s so empty, so so empty. they don’t even want to be happier, as much as they can convince themselve that they do. they don’t want to be happy, they just want millions of screaming fans chanting “rock and roll”. . they want money, they want the items money can buy, but not the horrible emptiness that is left when they have everything they’ve ever wanted……. . fame. money. someone to hold onto. whatever it is, it’s always. . their lives are kept stable- not miserable, that is- by having something to wish for and to work for. . but what they’re working for are stupid shadows of what the things actually are. they don’t even want happiness to be gained from these kinds of things, they just want the things themselves. think of it. look at your own life. the way i live my life is kind of simple. . i’m happy. but i want to be happier. so i do the things that i think might make me happier. if what i do makes me happier, i consider the paths i could choose, and i take the next one that could make me even happier. if what i do makes me less happy, i take it into consideration for the next time a similar situation may occur. it’s kind of difficult when what makes me happier is changing the way the people around me work. . and it kind of reminds me of the way people want to change me because of how certain they are that they’re right, that everyone else is right… but oh well. i really think i’m living the way i should. . because all i want to change in people is to let open what they truly want inside, and to show them. . show them the world.   i don’t want to be a good writer.

    "body": "(3) Dipshit. why did that word just suddenly appear in my head? i’m kind of wondering a little more because it’s kind of taking effort to actually have something interesting to write about here now, and i really can’t rant, but none of is being written as it comes into my head, even though i’m typing it out rather quickly. . it’s kind of like, there’s not as much crap to carry me on. . typing endlessly with the ideas that my stream of consciousness are giving me. .   I’ve always taken each new encounter with a human being as a new challenge for me to actually work on. someone will come into my life, and i’ll be sure that i can actually do something with them, something to help them. . and i’ll be sure that i’m just the thing this person needs to help them through the difficult times they’ve been having (and i kind of realize how really pointless it is to have different chapters in here when the writings are basically all the same, even though i usually plan for the writings to be completely different each time i sit down to type them out). . anyway, i’m also usually quite certain that any female could be a female for me to finally hold onto, for me to be able to comfort, to be comforted by the comforting and to be comforted directly by her. and beautiful is rarely a word that i won’t use within my own mind to destroy the latest one who has entered my life. . eventually i realize the reasons why they couldn’t handle a relationship with me, or why i wouldn’t even want a relationship with them. . but the reasons for that are always stupid reasons that take me back to the crap that is our modern civilization, what it says is right and what it says is wrong. . that it’s something different to have someone to hold onto and someone to love. . that love is something oh-so-difficult to achieve, that there is one person out there for you to love, that everyone else is just a piece of shit that shouldn’t matter to you anyway unless you’re going to donate your fake smiles and your child support to them (which of course you must do, because not doing that is yet another way to solidify your status as an evil hellspawn). i tell you now, that if you are lonely, and if you are tired, if you want peace or if you want disruption, i want to be here for you. . but i can only be here for you if i know that you want me here. if you think i’m a piece of shit, if you think i deserve nothing more than to be laughed at. . if you think my long hair makes me look like a fag, if you think that i’m nothing, that i’ll never accomplish anything, that my writings are so incredibly pointless because they don’t even tell a story, they don’t even have a cast of characters, they’re not even fiction, they’re not even about a typical family in a typical town disrupted by a force that they know nothing of, a force that is so greater than anything they could ever control… well, then, i suppose in that case i don’t want to help you at all. but if you can understand at all, or if you want to understand at all, i hear you, and i understand you, and i want to help you and i want to hold you and i want to love you. and i’ve never found a male whom i’ve desired to hold and i think it’s rather sad. but whether that’s a negative statement about males, females, gods or peasants. . at this point i just don’t know.   I’m not very smart.   I’ve kind of realized just now exactly how stupid i am, just how very… teenaged i am. i know it’s living by the standards set down in front of me, but first of all, i really have to weigh the different ideas that are coming into my head but somehow seem disorganized until i try to settle out their order on paper or on this computer. first of all, everything i’ve come to think and believe about the human race, how people think, how people should live. . all these things have come mostly from observation and careful consideration. i think about that, and i look at exactly how long mankind has been on the face of this planet, and i look at how little they’ve actually managed to determine about themselves, and i really begin to realize that i should find out a little more about others’ considerations before i even make a pathetic attempt to solidify any of my philosophies and ideas by writing them down here. first of all, i’ve tried the categorization of individuals i know, or knew, very little about. . only to find out through further reading and such that i was completely, 100% wrong in my simple assumptions about these people and what they were doing with their lives and what their errors could have been. the errors were truly errors that are often made by humans that i see everyday on the streets, so in the most. . spread out, anticoncentrated way, this was an observation of all. . a simple psychological evaluation, and a true one, simply not of the human being whom i’d initially thought it was applying to. i could try looking at myself and i could try to be unbiased about it, but i would come to the conclusion that i’m exactly the same as everyone else and that i’m not truly an original, that i only long for intelligent conversation with others so that i can listen to what they have to say that sounds reasonably intelligent, and comment on that with similar things i have heard or read about, and then steal the intelligent ideas that came from their mouths and use it the very next opportunity i happen to get to do so. i suppose that when i try to look at myself and describe the kind of person i am. . and i find that i’m so very different from one day to the next, i can look at it in a few different days- i can say that i’m striving to become the greatest adam ares that i can possibly be, i can say that i’m evolving, that all the silly mistakes i make because of my ignorance are corrected with each newfound enlightening thought or idea, or realization that just comes from nowhere because i’m such a damn creative fella. . but, um, i guess that doesn’t really make a lot of sense. because, again, i’m fooling myself…. . i can’t look at the people who really think that i have something to say, who think that what i want is right and that the way i think is right and that if i think others have more profound things to say simply because they’ve been building off of the principals of others (completely ignoring the futility of building off of an idea that appears sound, but has not been built from anything else within one’s mind, but rather being stolen from someone else, seeing that it appears to make sense, judging by the observations and prejudices that one holds as their own), that i’m demeaning myself and what i could possibly accomplish, that i could change this world and that i could make it better. . that the people who just stumble around everyday, the people i see shopping through the sacred halls of k-mart with their 4-year-old toddler on a leash like an inhuman mexican jumping bean that can’t be allowed to do anything but stay by their mother’s side, the people who come to my door and ask if my parents allow me to choose my own reading material before handing me a pamphlet about how we’re gonna rot in hell unless we worship a demystified version of hitler in the way that only their religion can do, are the very same ones who push the idea that building off of your own ideas and your own ideas only is a stupid, juvenile thing to do and makes you an egotistical bastard with no regard for the omnipotent skeleton of our modern day society. . that these people are silly weenies and that we are the power, we are the power. . we. . are. . the. . and then i look around for a moment and i see that i’m standing underneath an undetermined light source in an otherwise empty dance hall, dark as pitch, with the stench of bad cologne wreaking havoc on my olfactory nerves. i call out the name of anyone, of everyone, and there’s no response except for my own hoarse voice as it returns to me with a long-dead fig leaf that doesn’t effect me the way i might have previously predicted it would. i look at all the people who might agree with me, and come up to me in the mall and ask me sign their pet donkey so that they might sell him for the money to buy an antidote for my beliefs. and i look at all the people who were racing with forrest gump with such a determination, as they declare that forrest gump, in his silence, is the reborn messiah. and i decide to stop my running, and i decide to turn around, and i tell them all to go the fuck home…. and i walk on my own for a little as a small raincloud opens above my head. and i walk through a park that i’ve never seen before in my life, and it’s surrounded by forested areas, and i begin to feel soaked to the bone and i love it more than i’ve ever loved anything before in all the years of my existence. . and i sit down alone on a park bench and i think to myself and i wonder if i look as cool as trent reznor would as i sit here considering what might happen to my future, to my past, to my everything. . and i pull out a laptop computer that i don’t really have in real life, and i log onto america online but i don’t actually have any mail, and my buddylist is empty, and i throw the computer into a puddle and i look up at the raincloud but see somewhere above it a light that’s shining down on me, or attempting to, through the raincloud. i consider it for only a brief moment, however, before just deciding that it’s not worth it and walking around a bit around the children’s play area. i touch the wooden structures designed for young ones to climb on, and i feel the cold dampness of the rain-soaked see-saw… i see no children on the playground but i feel the lovely desolation and the wonderful misery. i smile for a second as i realize just how much i’m reveling in this nonsense and this crap. i walk into a nearby bookstore and i see my latest bestseller sitting next to “chicken soup for the soul part 10: chicken soup goes hip-hop”. and i play with my hair a little bit and i see the people i’m used to seeing in k-mart again. only this time they’re here, and they’re buying a couple dean koontz books for the only friend of theirs who didn’t get good grades in high school, who ironically is also the only friend who actually enjoys reading anything. and i suck on my thumb for a little before i walk back home and just go to sleep because i couldn’t find anything else to think about in any sort of a semi-meaningful fashion. and i hate it all again, because reality is such a curse when you try to avoid it by trying to find it.   i have some friends. but i can never truly respect them nearly as much as i can respect myself. because they like me. and i could never truly like myself. because i come so close to violating the sanctity. of what is. myself.   I used to think that i was a cynic, because i hated and despised most of the people around me. then i became enlightened to the fact that my self-glorification makes me an idealist.   I’m not writing with my muscles clenched, and i’m not having my train of thought interrupted every couple of seconds by someone asking another stupid question or dismissing everything that i could ever love and cherish and consider worth living my life for with a “pssh! whatever!” and that stupid hand gesture that you see everybody doing on ricki lake. i’m just. . alone. i only go to school for first period now. . and i’ve only started doing that because my mother got a phone call from the vice principal saying that if i didn’t start coming to school they would have to send a truant officer after me. . and i really don’t need that kind of garbage getting in the way of my life at this point. this is really the most stable i’ve been in awhile. . i don’t know what this is now. i really just have nothing to do and nothing to complain about, nothing to love and nothing to hate, and i’m not even bored with it. i don’t know what exists in my life now besides my vague impressions of the future that i see inside my head… and i could complain that perhaps living like this is just living for the future, something that isn’t now, and i could say that that makes me a horrible hypocrite and that i hate myself. . but, really, i don’t even feel that now. and if i can’t even criticize myself, then wow, what an interesting state that makes me in now. . well, not interesting for these writings, at all, but instead interesting for myself. . because it’s uncharted territory and it’s really a difficult thing for me to even guess where i might end up next. i mean, before there’d always been desire, there’d always been that silly pursuit of the child of beauty, sitting there on what i’d always perceived as the twilight. . but then what was supposed to be starlight instead just turned into a new dawn for myself… the same dawn that i’d experienced several times before. because i reached the child of beauty, and i saw that she wasn’t as beautiful as i’d imagined she would be. and i saw that the child of beauty was not what i wanted, what i needed to lead me away from what i’d been whining about in my repetitive rants about how it was everyone else and how darn stressful it was for me to stand up in front of the world with a romance novel in hand and declare that i was god. and then. . then i found the world that the child of beauty was but a shadow of. . and that was the greatest outlet i could ever have imagined. . and it helped me with a lot. . but left a huge, gaping hole in what i’d started with these writings. . because i can no longer sit here and write about how i want to kill maim slaughter and how i want to love hug hold dear. . because. . um. . i don’t really want anything now. it’s kind of neat when i look at the way life actually tends to hold onto the essential plot elements, if you look at it the right way.   My determination is gone, and yet so are my feelings of futility. i don’t feel that i’m so miserable now, that i actually have anything to gain from putting my all into any one thing, as i thought i had done with my ideals of accomplishing things in this world and making it a better place for myself to live in. i’m happy, but more importantly i’m content. and i suppose the different parts of myself shown in this book should feel bitter contempt for certain other parts, but i guess i’m not a hypocrite, even as i’m contradicting my previously stated claims that i am. i just. . i just change. a lot. and if i can change so much, i guess that kind of shows that maybe we should all just pack our things and go home. maybe the show’s all over and we have nothing to gain from continuing to toy around with the silly ideas that we once had. . but still i feel the child that’s within me, and i still feel the same way that i always have. i still refuse to live life the way that people will tell me to directly. . but maybe in that i’m just like most human beings anyway. maybe i’m just like the people who stormed the bastille but still believed in jesus christ. maybe i’m controlled by my hatred towards authority… but no. . no, it’s not that. . because i don’t try to contradict the rules set down upon me. . i simply refuse to live by them. but still, that’s nonetheless defiance. . no, that’s living life the way i want to, free of outside influence. . no, no. . it’s. . ah, screw it, i don’t know. and the sad fact of the matter is that i don’t care anymore. i’m like an addict who’s just had his fix. what am i now? what have i become?

    "body": "(4) “if you’re happy and you know it, clap your handS. ” a horrible silence fills the room, and everyone stares at me as i sit in a chair onstage with my hair tied back and with my glasses on, musical beats disrupting everything that i’m trying to say. i’m supposed to be addressing these people. but instead i’m singinG. “if you’re happy and you know it, clap your handS. ” FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! …sorry, i haven’t done that in awhile, i thought it would be a good preview of the shit that is yet to come…. i actually think i’m regressing already. . i’m probably gonna wind up being whiney and a sorry piece of caca again. . because i’m rocking back and forth in my chair quite a bit now and the feelings in my mind and what i want to do with my body are all so unsatisfied, even as they’re so unsatisfying when i do it. and i know and i know and i know and i know and i don’t really know much at all. sarah is dreams, she is my dream, but she isn’t everything and i want you to know that i’m now using her name and that’s gonna make this more fucked up than ever. and it’s going to make it harder for me to feel caring because i can’t lie if i’m feeling badly about her, but i don’t know how or why i could ever feel badly about her and yup i think it’s a pretty safe bet that i’m getting back to whining again. damn, i’d forgotten just how quicky i wrote these things even as i wrote them so rarely, at least not even close to as often as i’m writing these things now, as this is actually kind of neat, to see the amount of material i’ve written increase by such a huge amount… and i faintly think i smell the scent of alcohol, yummy wine, but it’s probably just the smell of something i can describe but don’t want to describe. heh. well, i guess i wasn’t enjoying my peace all that much, because all of a sudden it’s started to come back, and really i just figure it’s my mind’s way of keeping myself interested with my writings by making up its own little story as i go along jotting down all of my thoughts that most likely aren’t even my own fucking thoughts because i’m just some stupid character i’ve thought up with a little help from all of my little friends, like anastasia and all those other stupid people i don’t even know much about, who belong in the comic book that i’m never gonna write. and i know all of a sudden why i was never really writing a heckuva lot of things when i was writing things like this. . because i just keep stopping because of the music in my head. i don’t know how i stopped the music, but i’m feeling it again. heck, maybe the next time i sit down to write it’ll be completely different and i won’t be thinking like this. . but when i sit down to write and have to interrupt myself because of all my nervous, hyperactive energy. . yeesh, i guess that’s when i write that kind of insane irratic stufF. i watched some of that show about the teenage witch. she had a talking cat named salem. that. . that was pretty awful stuff. i also watched boy meets world. . right now, i can look back and talk about how much i hated that stuff, but for that one hour when i was watching those shows, i was completely under their spell. it was like i was writing about before, when i was watching the episode of the daily show that i’d already seen. . the show was just there controlling me, and i was only along for the ride…. i really don’t like that feeling… and i don’t think that’s what television should be abouT. don’t let me fool you, i’m not writing this because i like it. . i’m writing because i want to get this finished as a book, and i want to show it to people and say, “wow, adam, you’re a genius. ” all of this is shit, don’t believe it for a minute…. ow, i have a headachE. boy, do i feel like an idiot. . i guess that’s because i really am one. hm. . “hello, i’m adam. i’m the stupidest, most pretentious asshole on the face of the planet. ” i don’t see why anyone would enjoy this shit, except to look down on me and spit on me and kill me and kill me and kill me… in the same way that i kill myself every day. maybe some day i’ll be a decent thinker. maybe i’ll be one of those nifty scholar people who write new introductions to moby dick. heh. i was going to call this book “the yet-to-be-named larger work”, but now maybe i’ll just call it “i’m a pretentious asshole”. that’d be neaT. i have two guitars in my room. one of them’s named trendy- she’s an electric. . one of them’s named broken- she’s an old classical-style acoustic that used to be my uncle’s until he left it over here years ago, so we got it restrung and now is decent enough to play on. i’ve been playing for six months. . i went and took one lesson, but it was an insult to my intelligence and much too expensive, so i decided to learn on my own. . everything i know about guitar now, i learned off of internet tablature. i need to get some books so i can learn about theory and such, though. . i mean, i have a few songs, but they’re just sad acoustic stuff. . i know nothing about scales or anything, so i really have to work on that. i really doubt i’ll ever be in a band or anything, but i think i could do it well if i did. . though i’d probably piss off everyone else in the band because i’d care too much about the music and not just want to play the same kind of crap over and oveR. well. i suppose at this point i’m adhering to the laws of human nature. . i suppose that anything i do now could be summed up in a few words by some liberal arts major who just got a job as a review column writer in the newspaper. i guess i can be dismissed as any kid you might happen to see on the street, only with a larger vocabulary and a hell of a lot more time on his hands than anyone should actually have. i suppose that i should be upset, but one of the strange things about the way i live my life is just how gracefully i can accept the idea that i’ve been living a lie for so long. i really have no idea how that part of me came about, but nonetheless it seems to be true. i never did actually get around to finishing that role-playing game that steve and i were programming. i never did get around to finishing that “understanding the truth about everything” thing, either. . but for awhile, i thought i knew everything. now if that isn’t stereotypical, i really don’t know what iS. so here’s the plan. tell me if you think it’s a good one. i sit here, almost asleep now, unhappy with having written almost 7 pages’ worth of new material in one day, and i try to calm myself down, and i try to kill the funky dance beats that i keep feeling that longing for. (it’s a really strange part of my existence- i can hardly contain myself even as i read. . i need to release all that nervous energy by rubbing my hands together and stuff. it’s quite odd) i realize that i’m just about ready to fall asleep (at least that’s what i was writing about here. . but i’m starting to think that perhaps i’m a little more awake than i thought i was). . and i wait for the moment when i won’t really be thinking and i won’t be disrupted by any music inside my head, instead i’ll just be able to write some more about the stupid evil direction that i’m going in. . and i kind of laugh for a second as i think about the fact that this entire thing has been about my questioning of myself. . and exactly where i thought my life was headed… and exactly what i thought i should do with my life. even within the writing this book so far, there are countless times when i’ve changed my mind about the way i think about a certain thing. and i really don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing, but i also don’t know how i should be using such terms. (dance beats again- annoying the hell outta me) (i wonder if the one or two dance beats that keep coming to me are some kind of deep, horrible secret that i’m cursed with the awareness of. maybe these beats are something metaphysical that i stumbled upon unknowingly, designed to torment me for the rest of my days, designed to drive me to suicide. . kind of like the guy in “the telltale heart”, with his “overacuteness of the senses”. . hmm. . it’s something to consider. and maybe if i demonstrated these beats to someone else, they’d be cursed with the same thing, and it’d be like a horrible plague. . and people would spread it unknowingly to others, because they wouldn’t really be thinking, and all of a sudden wham! they’ve started playing it on their desk at school and half a dozen other children have heard it. . what a horrible kind of disease that would be, to have spreading around the world. eventually it would end up like “the stand”, except only the deaf people would be left. ) hmm. i was talking about something deep and meaningful back there, wasn’t i? eh. i didn’t think so eitheR. you know, i’ve been told that my writings really conflict with the way i act around other people. . they say that it’s like the total opposite of the adam they know. . and, well, it’s true that i’m usually nice and happy and jumpy and friendly around others, at least around others who’ll talk to me. . but the thing is, the part of me that writes this stuff is there waiting to be unleashed. it just takes someone who actually wants to find it. . of course, usually if someone wants to see this side of me, i’m so excited by the prospect of actually holding intelligent conversations with something that i won’t be able to be the angst-ridden screamy guy who feels so lonely and miserable, the guy within me that was so well-represented within parts of “kinetic anxiety”. i haven’t had many chances to have intelligent conversation. . i’ve had it with cathy several times, and also with sarah. . other than that, probably only short little bits of conversation that actually had any thought behind it. . most of the time when i’m around others, you see, i’m putting into action the ideas that these words simply preach about. . i really just want to spread kindness and love and all that other sappy stuff. . and above all, i want to have fun, without having people being so defensive and stuff like i always seem to run into them doinG. i journeyed through the abyssal darkness that lies within and all i got was this lousy t-shirt. and i lick my wounds and i beat the shit out of everything that has helped me as i reason with myself for a bit and i really that i can never truly have anything, that trying to reach anything and trying to learn and trying to produce art is all SHIT and i have no reason to try to do anything anymore except be happy be happy but how the fuck can i be happy? i’m happy as i sit here, alone in my room, at my typewriter. . no, it’s not a happiness, it’s a determination. . jeez, i can figure out anyone but myself. . even though before a couple years ago, i was even more lost within myself than i am now. quite a bit moreso than i am now, actually. i would lie to myself so much, and i would pretend that i had understood things in the past that i couldn’t even understand in the present, and i would hold myself up at the level of a really manipulative little boy, pulling the strings of all the ignorant grown-ups who were always so certain that he was nothing he was nothing BUT HE TRULY WAS NOTHING, and then now i’m at the point i’m at now, where i can see what’s messed up about the way i am, and i can see what’s messed up about the ways of everyone else, but i can’t see the light of all that’s good. . the light of all that’s true. because. . what is truth? we build off of foundations we know nothing about. we know the fruits of others’ labors, but we don’t know the labors. we don’t know how others have determined the “facts” and “truths” that dominate our everyday lives. . we only know whether or not we agree with their ideas, based on our prejudices! grr. who is anyone to question the calculated judgments of another when they could never have followed the exact train of thought that had brought this person to reach their conclusion? even they were most certainly building off of the ideas of others building off the ideas of others ARRRGH and i just see how really pointless it is and i don’t really need to give a shit about philosophizing, because all i want is to get people to stop saying “no i can’t, i’m too shy” and to get them to follow their hearts and their- ah, fuck their minds, what matters more than personal satisfaction? we can live we can live we can live and the only purpose that ones mind should serve is serving everything that is entirely against it. . to plan for the future’s now… temporary satisfaction, all-encompassing opiate of pleasure, sex, drugs, rock and roll, all being forecasted and worked upon, improved. . improving what is the future now, so that when it is now, it will be oh-so-much better. to do this until one is content… or until they are dead. this is what to do what to do what to do THIS IS WHAT I DO.

    "body": "Day One: Wonderland alice in wonderland. how do you get to wonderland? over the hill, or here or there? i wonder where… wouldn’t it be nice to visit wonderland? i think to myself as i sit in my room with the light turned off simply for the added effect of scary, all-encompassing darkness- a weak attempt that doesn’t work at all, thanks to the blinding whiteness of the computer screen in front of me- a whiteness i could change if only i really cared about it enough to do such a thing. i think back to my third grade play, when i played the white rabbit, and i was so incredibly certain that i was always doing a wonderful job and that i was really really talented and that i felt right at home onstage. i didn’t even think of myself as a pathetic nervous freak as i stood there on stage that day, but that’s exactly how i appeared. down my shirt was stuffed a pillow to give myself a belly, which i didn’t really understand, since the white rabbit, to the best of my knowledge, had never been portrayed as especially fat. this pillow kept slipping and falling, and every few seconds i would be playing with it, trying to keep it up. . other than that i just stood there, staring blankly into the audience, not actually paying any attention to what any of them were doing, but living in the odd haze that i was always living in back in those days- when i wouldn’t grow bored, when i wouldn’t be thinking of all the better things that i could be doing with my time… i simply existed as i stood there at the front of the stage, and the play went on behind me. . and i listened for when my next part would come up, and i would say my lines but not really care, and i never even thought for a second that i was doing anything wrong. i still remember a lot of the songs from that play… even a few of the parts that i spoke. it never held any significance for me then. . it was just a silly play. . based on a silly movie… right? i never would have suspected that i could ever write anything like this. . even though i’d always wanted to be a writer. . i think i always just pictured myself writing bestselling novels, instead of just sitting here in my room with nothing at all except my stupid, juvenile mind and a computer and all sorts of hyperactive energy that never seems to die down. of course, nothing like this has ever been written, to the best of my knowledge, and just when i become familiar with a style i always feel drawn to just crushing it and seeing what i have left over. i am not going to be a writer. i’m going to be a computer programmer, and i’m going to spend long nights working, and my life is going to be hell. . but i’m going to come home some time, and i’m still going to have the energy and the emotion and the humanity to type these things out. . if not things like this, they’ll be things… things. . things. . anything that i can put myself into. i don’t have to write about myself to write about myself…. because i don’t want to write about myself because it can be…. so. . painful. and my eyebrows sink to the floor and my face tightens up and it all concentrates itself into my brow and the area between my eyes. and again i’m reminded that i simply don’t know how to cry. but i don’t know how to let myself free, either. . free of all these voices that you, too, can now hear, free of all that which people can beg to me not to wish to destroy. . things that i can’t even convince myself i truly wish to destroy. i think i want a wonderland. i started my writing of this section with the assumption that i was ready to turn myself upside down and inside out and say that i’m really a lobster named misanthropic and that i’ve just had you fooled all along. . that like the young boy who i once was, who i will always be, that i’m just the greatest manipulator in the history of all mankind… i want to have. . i want to…. have. i’ve never really wanted. . much. cathy was over today and i began drifting off into sleep until she all of a sudden questioned me about the things i’ve said about antireason. and i tried telling her that it was for her to figure out herself, but she didn’t want to. . she wanted me to tell her. and i told her that it was nothing but just one of my pointless ways of looking at emotion. . and determination. but as i spoke about these things, and as i tried to make myself sound reasonably intelligent. . i fell into a rabbit hole. i fell into a rabbit hole hole and i fell for a mile for a mile for several thousand fucking miles. and i hit rock bottom and i suddenly decided that my fall was a metaphor for something greater, something that i’d have to figure out later on because i had some more meaningless things to give meaning to on the other side of the room. for on the other side of the room sat a table. and on that table was a naked girlie and she was dancing but she was falling several times and she didn’t have very large breasts but she was clutching a book whose title i couldn’t exactly make out and she was in danger and she was crying out for help but she was also simultaneously cooking bacon on a stove that didn’t actually exist. tied to her ankle was a tag reading, “do not open until xmas. ” christmas christmas christ was born and i wanted him to die a more painful death but that just wouldn’t make me happy enough because again i have no clue and again i have no dice and again i’m only just typing as catharsis of the stuff of life of the stuff of lap lap lap lick lick antireason. and i’m not baking a cake for anyone but myself, and sometimes i don’t feel that i’m up to the responsibility of sitting in front of the oven all day waiting for the fucking cake to be done when the oven’s not even on because the oven doesn’t even have an “on” switch. i really started thinking that i could cloud my mind with weenies, roast them on what’s burning up inside. burning up the inside of my own mind is the angst-ridden sanctuary of nothingness… i haven’t been disappointed by anything, and i’m not being overwhelmed by loneliness. . i’m only being overwhelmed by the fact that my only outlet, and the only thing that i really have to live for in the present right now are these writings. and i am hoping to visit soon, and as i lie there bleeding i will have my tongue in a nicer place, and a nicer home, and i will learn to love the… why can’t i have her and why do i want her (because you don’t want anything else. everything has become so monotonous and pointless that you fear you will become the 9 to 5 working scumbag whom you’ve always despised so much. you make yourself sick with your delusions of grandeur and your delusions of self-depreciation. being with her gives you something to take away the pain, while writing only brings it out as a manifestation, and you write these words until you tire yourself out and you collapse onto the floor writhing with the agony of being unconscious). . thank you, i was curious about that. how much of my life will be spared as i go onto college? will i become famous and have all these silly rants published, as i am the billy corgan of writing and as if i keep going at this rate i’ll have to get a bigger hard drive just to keep all of my writings about the same old nothing that i really shouldn’t be worried about at all. there is no such thing as contentedness. contentedness is only the lack of emotion, a natural result of getting rid of it all in one way or another. . and contentedness is boring, it’s just. . nothing, it’s just. . sitting there in your chair and being kind of happy-bouncy but then looking around and realizing that you have nothing to even accomplish with all that happy-bouncy energy. wow. i mean, all i’ve been talking about is how i’m just going to keep working on making myself happier until i’m content with my happiness… but for that i would have to have faith. because to be content, and to know that you won’t have to work any more to become happier, one always has to believe that nothing will change. one has to have faith that the love of their life will not leave them and that they will be able to live on a pretty farm out in the country and make love and make love even when they’re old and 90 and they’ve removed the mirrors from the house, not because they find themselves ugly but because mirrors are a sign of vanity and vanity is an evil satanic thing that has no place in such a wonderful place of happiness, the sanctity of a nice house with a cool porch to sit in on breezy spring mornings, watching the grass blow and the cows be cows and hearing the gunshots in the distance but not really caring because you know they would never be mean enough to try and hurt you or your wife or your dog rover. heh. so is that to be my future? is that all that i’ve worked so hard for? am i just going to give up all my silly dreams of independent thought and being myself and never truly holding any beliefs because belief is not to notice, belief is just some faith? if i am to be happy, i will. because the final answer is ignorance is bliss. and i hang my head and i cover up my face and i brush aside the people trying to block my way from the dressing room and i sit there and i look in the mirror and i look at my eyebrows and i stare into my eyes but they just don’t care for themselves and when i try to make some contact with myself i just spit in my own face and i watch it slowly slide down the mirror and i’m glad that my reflection, my shadow isn’t actually myself because it’s so damn hollow and in reality i’m a lot more charming, obviously, since no one finds me ugly but this reflection that i stare at is the ugliest thing i’ve ever had the misfortune to look upon. go drown in your own piss, you fucking oysters.

    "body": "Day Three: Letting What Could Normally Slip By Unnoticed Live Forever in Writing I was just talking to tarma (katie) a bit. i was basically trying to convince her that writing out one’s thoughts is basically the key to self-understanding, realization of the ways your mind works, where you’ve been, where you’re going. . because you can’t hide from what you’ve written. and thoughts are so easily changed to suit a theory you might be going over in your mind. doublethink, my friend, while letting the potentially damaging thought drift away into realms forever (or at least for a long while) to be locked away, unheard from. i really don’t think people could find much out of these writings that is extremely interesting, unless they actually know me. in that case most people would probably be pretty shocked. because i’m completely honest with people, but only if they’re curious enough to care and to inquire about the ways of my mind and my life and my dreams and my realities. very few people care about that nowadays. but i do. i really, really care about that. because i can never be satisfied with what lies on the surface. “Give me life. give me pain. give me myself again. ” “Yes, m’lord. ” I wonder where that wonderland idea slipped off to. “to often look, and for the definite to collapse into the idols of the past. ” heh. i mean, the big picture is there now… i can point behind me now and i have some stuff behind me, but i have even more ahead of me. wow. that’s a really odd thought. because what lies behind me i can see so clearly and i can understand perfectly. . but could i possibly find anything new and interesting and could i think in new and interesting ways in the future? hm. how can i explain to someone that i love them and that i can just see people fucking flipping through the pages of this book thingie and just throwing it down and saying that they don’t really have the time to read it or worse yet just keeping it and fucking smiling and saying thanks i’m sure it’s great stuff and never reading it and just whispering to somebody else, “what was adam’s writing like? i just couldn’t sit through all of it those fucking shitty ramblings what the hell’s the point i just don’t get it he’s just a lunatic what the hell’s the…. . point. . what the. . hell. i had some momentum there but it died. and i feel like i’m having a heart attack now but i know it’s just some more of my annoying chest pains that i have and i really should see a doctor or at least complain about it but i don’t know and i remember the little thing by they might be giants on apollo 18 that’s part of that fingertips thing, which is just a compilation of a bunch of fun stuff and he just sings, “i’m having a heart attack. . i’m having a heart attack. ” that’s not really funny. i don’t like having chest pains because (they still haven’t gone away) you never know which pain could be your last, so you kind of learn to treasure every little pain that you feel oooo yay soothing and invigorating damn i like it. scratch scratch i have a lot of itches. domino orgy domino orgy. heh. i haven’t cared much about them for awhile. probably because i’ve been here writing about how bored i am while they’re worshipping their little quail poems and as they’re being oh so beautiful to the oh so ignorant and again i don’t like the fact that i’m thinking about how ignorance is bliss and how i only live to be happy and therefore i only live to be ignorant. i mean, what other possible. . what… how. . how fucking stupid is it to think that man should try to accomplish anything other than be happy? i mean, then again. . sadness is. . happiness. . and happiness is. . sadness. . and it’s all just a convoluted stew… woohoo. ain’t this wonderful. i don’t know where to go from this little stalemate. i could scream the f word again, but hey, what really would that do? i don’t know, i have no one to blame but myself and i’m not being repressed and i’m still just sitting here and it’s still just kinetic rubble and i’m still not barney rubble and i still don’t know what the paper clip could do for me as it guides me through the paper-walled labyrinth of wonderland. why do i not only have chest pains now, but wrist pains as well? that really must be a pretty bad sign. heh. maybe i should write a little faster just in case i die. i’d like to have enough shit here to be able to publish as “journals of a teenage madman”. right next to the latest bestseller by rush limbaugh. . dennis rodman. . bill gates. . o. j. simpson… stephen king. oooo, how wonderful. they could drag my corpse onto politically incorrect and i could pretend i don’t mind the fact that they’re not on comedy central anymore. i’m always tired as soon as it’s too late for me to possibly wake up in time for school. less than a month left, but still. . gr. . then lenny’s decided he’s going to use the fact that i told him i’m going to drop out as reason to pull a bunch of shit and try to get my mom in trouble when she’s nothing anyway and he knows that i know what i’m doing but he’s just nothing he’s just nothing but hey, what the hell, it’ll all be okay because jesus will come and save him. . right? right? (no, cannot add any question, it is all about faith, it is all about faith. . but why? [don’t fucking ask that! god works in mysterious ways, that’s it. ] yeah, that’s it. ) praise the lord… but i \ can’t even \ write / can i? \ anymore \ it’s just shit \ it’s all \ shit \ fucker \ me \ to \ your / dreams / all your / seven \ dreams. all seven. and we’ll watch. them. fall. and we will have nothing but we will be dancing in the moonlight we’ll be tiptoeing through the tulips and finally we’ll be happy just like the people who found it quite humorous to shove me around to shove me around to Never leave me alone as i know that they will just get sick of me if i just keep my fucking mouth shut and i just move as quickly as i possibly can and why the fuck aren’t they opening the doors yet why must i be trapped outside here with all these people who won’t just let me exist and cry inside in the cold loneliness the desolation the solitude that i’ve come to love because it’s better than the rest of the world the rest of the world is shit and what the fuck does anyone know i just wanna go home and then i can be happy and i won’t have to think about coming to school and they’re kicking me in the ass now and i just want to go home and i can watch my mtv and this world will not exist at all as i flip the channel as i cook myself a pizza in the wonderful toaster oven that’s not school because school does not fucking don’t you try to spit on me or i’ll show you that i’m not GRRRR i’m sorry oh i fuck now they laugh how can they laugh i’m just displaying emotion is it evil to display emotion? please tell me oh god why can’t i just why do they single me out look at all those other fucking dorks i’m not the lowest of low i know i like that kid and i talk to him but he’s a piece of shit nerd why don’t they just pick on him and why do they have to be so mean and why is it it is everyone else i have a dozen kids who think it’s fun as hell to just torment me and there are never any adults around who seem to want to give a fuck even as they allow they allow you better not fucking bring a walkman into school you young deviant as i get the shit beat out of me but they’re not beating the shit out of me and i’m not bleeding not physically fucker and the door’s open and i go as fast as i can but i won’t run won’t run they’re all pieces of shit and i have dignity i have dignity it’s okay because i will one day rule over them those pieces of shit and the tables will be turned and haha! and i won’t just be 12 years old anymore and i’ll be able to run them over with my established superiority and what’ll they say to that? when i can shove in their face that it was all just a sick little game that i was playing that it wasn’t in my plan to stand up for myself but you’re all pieces of shit, you hear that? of course you don’t, you can’t read my mind but i can read yours you all have the same mind and it just says “i’m a fucking piece of fucking shit” and perhaps you kick me now and shove me here and shove me there and it looks like there’s at least 20 of them now everyone who’s behind me now everyone sees how fun it is because i’m nothing and it’s time for me to go to my locker so you shove me as hard as you can and i hit my face on it and it hurts but no that isn’t a tear but they would fucking love that wouldn’t they? i won’t give them the satisfaction because it’s not there the fuckers i need to know my combination are they gone? they’d better not see my combination at least i wouldn’t fit in this locker cause i’m so fat but hell what does it matter anyway it’s time to go back to class and at least i’ll have my little world because in this class the mean people aren’t sitting right next to me like they seem to be elsewhere but more importantly they don’t bother me either like they do in every other class but heh, okay i have my book and it’s okay and oh that’s fine and oh, i know i could love and be loved but i’m not going to think about that because that’s yet to come and why oh why okay i’m going to class now i’m going to class now i’m going to class now (i’m no longer human). Well what an interesting little (where was i then where am i now?) i accidentally pasted the lyrics to “snail” by the smashing pumpkins here and i didn’t leave them here but they made me think and i’m going to listen to it now…. . thank you snail thank you phew wow ack i like to think that that song means a lot to me but what does it mean? i can understand the words and i can understand what they mean but as a whole, as a whole? how many kisses will she deliver before i understand that it’s not a question of who delivered the kiss and why, it’s just the knowledge that i love the kiss and that i couldn’t imagine anything greater than to kiss to be kissed by things that don’t even exist that don’t even have lips even though everything i’m speaking about isn’t to be taken literally unless you’re a complete psychopath like myself. . what you wait for? flower chase the sunshine. . for the sunshine is evil and i don’t know why, but i really don’t like sunshine… i never really liked sunny days. . heh. yeah, i agree. . and sometimes the sadness is such a wonderful thing to be in love with and to love and to masturbate to because heh heh heh you know it’s true and you know you agree and i smirk i dunno if you do too but you would if you were me and if you were me you’d kill yourself but not really because you’d be me but i smirk when i’m sad and when i’m angry i wear no expression because i show no emotion i write it out and i preserve it in a can and i bury it just long enough for it to grow to the right size when it holds all those really nifty important vitamins and i can serve it cold and i can call is mr. rutebega and i can rape it repeatedly but i can show everyone and they can tell me how much they didn’t understand it and how i really should look into psychological counseling. . heh. that’d kinda make it worth it, just to have people tell me how mentally ill i am. or maybe how mentally healthy. . for maybe everyone (do you hear me everyone? i know you’re out there. hi. you’re beautiful and i truly mean it. and i love you and i’m begging here). . everyone experiences this but they don’t let it ever reach the foreground and i let it encompass everything in a special little world of mine right here and i was literal for awhile but heck i’m not very literal right now as i tell things exactly as they are and if you don’t understand that’s because it’s verbatim and if you do understand that’s because it’s verboten. eek. are you tired of having yourself and i want to cry i want to cry i have no idea why but i want to cry i want to cry and i want to cry to a fucking disco beat mommy. i have too much and i will take you there let me take you there and hey that break wasn’t supposed to be in there so i shall delete it my friend my brother my proud fellow stereotype because we. know. we. seek. revenge. by KILLING by using by submitting to what they are trying to demean us with. and that’s kind of really going off on a tangeant but hell that’s what the mind is for and i unravel and i’m just thinking just mentioning the brother thing kinda makes me think of all those preconceived ideas of where one should fit in and again with the idea that it’s all kind of set up that from birth it’s all set that it’s fate but hell if i were black and i were educated i sure as hell wouldn’t want to talk like an idiot just because i’d been raised to believe that showing myself as ignorant would be showing respect for where i came from. because i’m all about myself. and i’m all about my beliefs. . i don’t come from a particular culture that i should try to respect. . i’m myself. and i’m not going to change the ways i live my life because of the way others did. that’s pathetic. one can easily have respect for something without becoming it… or at least i can. i really can’t stand it. there is no black there is no white there is no family and there is civilization there is only what you feel in your heart, everyone, please understand that we should all love one another but not rely on one another. no one seems to understand and intelligence seems so hard to come by from here and howard stern is actually an okay guy but he doesn’t really explain himself very well but that’s what he’s all about so oh well and hm, america online’s dead for a few hours. i wonder if i’m going to go to school today, that would be neat. maybe i’ll write some more stuff there, probably not, i could just neat. more than likely, actually, i won’t be able to see myself going to school and surviving the walk home and i really hate that i have to live like this but the consequences of doing otherwise just aren’t worth it.

martians even with the odd level of gravity and the circuitry of the existence that we’re so sure is the same as the atomic explosions that take place on the sun everyday as someone comments on the certain ambiance of a medium-sized star that’s one day going to fry us all (but that we really shouldn’t worry about because our lives are quite short anyway hey hey) \\no no no you should not think that way, you should live your life for the betterment of mankind but never even give a shit about them do you see what i’m saying mister? you can make it happen and you can question the metaphysical and you can become the metaphysical and you can explain the ideas of the metaphysical to your children and your children’s children as they sit in an old folks’ home at age 2 and you still sleep in a crib in a coffin in a world that you’re certain can’t exist, in an existence that you’re certain can’t be the world. try to believe that i mean anything when i put my heart and soul into a piece for myself to look back upon and hate and hate and hate as i tend to hate everything that i cut in this world because i don’t even know how to cut cheese without invisible celtics dancing the macarena around the PAPER CLIP!   all of my friendships always seem so empty, as they’re tainted by the individual characteristics of each human being. why must so many humans be lesser than or equal to the number one, i ask myself, and how can a human being who will never understand what he is not so easily decide that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, that he is an ever-growing brownish grass blade just waiting to be mowed? when one’s point of view cannot even come close to revealing the truth that we are all the same in that we are different, they nonetheless believe that what exists on the other side of the fence is that which is worthy, simply because they have heard from many other grass blades that one grass blade long ago heard this truth from the homeowner. very rarely will i come across a human being who can hold more than one truth, more than one reason, more than one perspective within their mind and see the thusly improved depth that such an existence has to offer. and even when i do meet a being such as that, i even then look down upon them almost in pity, as i see the “human spirit” that i have always subconsciously relied so heavily upon being crushed, and i see the individuality that i have so loudly touted the importance of being overshadowed by the knowledge that every small piece of this puzzle is shaped in its own form, but that it, like the bible, like the sensations of pain and pleasure, like the scientific observations of the basic fabrics of human existence. . is not a definite map to follow. it means, once again, that we are left here to live every day as we see fit.   the idea that selflessness, as rooted in self-deception as it is, has been the thing that has moved us into the position that we are in today, and has been the seed of every civilized advancement humankind has had to offer, is wrong in that selflessness itself does not exist. break it down to the simplist form that one can find of what causes pleasure and therefore helps the individual, and what causes pain to the individual (which can be representative of the opposite of pleasure, in that with the knowledge of pleasure comes the longing for pleasure, and with the longing of pleasure comes the uncomfortable pain that comes with the knowledge that such pleasure has been forsaken). let us base ourselves on the ever-prevelant christian standards of what is moral and what is immoral, that goodness comes from being kind to others, that the poor woman who gives her last coin is above the rich man who gives many more but is left with many as well. if, for the sake of the example i’m putting forth here, we establish as a hypothetical truth the idea that the more of oneself is given for the sake of others, the closer one comes to the divine ideal of what humanity should become (which is, in christianity, jesus christ- the martyr who helps the largest amount of beings possible). the devout christian who lives according to these established moral guidelines feels in exchange for his selflessness a feeling of pleasure. . and as with any other compromises, he feels that it is worth his while to give up, for instance, donations towards a charity, simply for the joy of giving which he himself receives. therefore, every act done is a selfish one, since we as humans, despite the obvious attributes only we possess, nonetheless have based, in the process of the development of our culture, our ideas of what is good and what is evil on the basic primal sensations of pain and pleasure. our every act is dominated by these forces, though more often than not they are mental sensations as opposed to physical ones. not many would give their life up to get a fatally wounded serial killer a final glass of water… but the perfect christian would, as he gains pleasure from being good, which under the christian dogmas is being a sacrificial lamb, whose most extreme manifestation would be that of the being who may give his life for the sake of another. all of this shows that the advance of civilization comes not from the selfless giving of others, but rather by a larger force that controls the actions of humans, which is quite simply man’s ignorance of where he comes from. the one who doesn’t understand why he acts the way he acts, why he enjoys what he enjoys, and who doesn’t feel any desire to understand such things, can easily have his feelings of an empty, confusing existence that comes from somewhere he doesn’t understand, and leads to somewhere he doesn’t understand, be magically cured by being given a goal, or an ideal to reach, however metaphysical, and have it be established as an ideal that would help out the rest of mankind. but when we reach a stage of civilization like today’s, it makes it painfully obvious that with these kinds of morals being thrust upon the children of such people, at an early enough age so that it becomes difficult to break away from them, the bettering of the world that comes from such ignorance can only end up as frankenstein’s monster, leaving us to say to ourselves: “what have we started?”   individual days cease to exist, and it all begins to mush together.   don’t you dare walk onto this sacred dance floor, you poser, for i have a pearl jam shirt and i’m not afraid to use it. i don’t take any pleasure in this as i have to beware of my friends, as they have to beware of me, but nonetheless it brings such a smile to my face because i’m around others… and for once they’re actually accepting me.   genocide: the happy paper.   it really hurts me that other people exist and exist and have to exist with me when i’m all alone and they’re the fucking worldly things that only exist in other worlds… why can’t i write this anymore? everything nothing whatever. i am leonardo davinci but i am the one holding the gun to my own head and telling myself that if i ever realize (but i realize everything, only i don’t accept it for an indisputable truth because there is no truth, obviously. . there’s only) (there are many, and they’re all only echos of what you’ve heard)….   it is all environment.   “they’re so lost. they. . are not. . what they could should would be. . ”– such crap crap crap. as is “YOU ARE RIGHT”. sting. and i rarely have the (my fucking glasses. [and i throw them aside] better but worse [so i pull up my chair a little closer]… “throw them away. you won’t need them anymore. ”) urge to. . what was i talking about? (you were talking about how everything right is wrong again) ooo, okay. always fun. didn’t i just talk about that? (yeah, but, um, that restructuring of your belief system is [hold on, new format]….   . the restructuring of your belief system has been done over so many times that it seems repetitive now to feel upset about the fact that with every new thought comes along an entirely new world for you to defend. . and since you’ve always lived building off of the idea that everything is what you believe, that that’s what you should defend. . well. . you’ve kind of exhausted any kind of interesting writings that you could come up with about such things (though you were trying to do this towards the end of shooting the mule). .   ?so now i. . renounce individuality as what should be most followed and defended? . pretty much. ?but. . now what do i have? . what you have is kind of a… bird’s eye view. ?i’ve spoken of that before. . yes, in “labyrinth“. but still… that was kind of like the view from atop the mountain. . you were basically spitting on everyone. ?mmm, chewy spree. these things are hard to find. . are you listening? ?of course. . the sprees represent, uhhhh, antireason. . mm. of course. ?you want one? . no, no, no, that’s not what i’m about. i’m here to tell you about the rhythms of the universe ?i thought you were here to preach chaos theory. . no! ?preaching communism then, perhaps? . not at all! where are you getting these ideas? ?you’re telling me that what i’ve been trying to live my life by is wrong. you’re telling me that for so long i’ve just been imagining that whatever i feel and think is what i should pursue. so either you’re telling me that there’s no reason at all, and that i should just get drunk a lot and never try to accomplish anything. . or you’re telling me that the goals i should follow are pre-established goals that i shouldn’t question. . basically saying that religion is the answer. . why must you complicate things so? ?you’re the one trying to kill me. . i’m doing no so thing. ?you’re trying to. . you should live in now. ?which i’ve always preached . but rarely practiced. you’ve said that everyone should just do what they want and not care about what the consequences would be. . ?i didn’t say that. i just cut down what the most frequently-used consequences are. . okay. but while you said that, you also were saying that so many people want change but feel that they couldn’t accomplish anything as just one insignificant human being. ?mmm hmm. . and basically you said that they were evil. &amp;everyone i love is that way… !SHUT UP! . i thought this was a private conversation. ?i’m gone. . hey! !EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UP! &amp;i miss loving. . we know you do. ?no kidding. that’s all you talk about. meeting adjourned.   one can make some good points when they reach a conclusion and then create the facts to support it. (my neck my neck my neck my neck is in such pain) but i reach no conclusion i only reach something i can say to provoke thought and to provoke pride and lust and all the fun things that i only bother with because &amp;nbsp i’m waiting to be be able to type for the circumstances beyond my control control them and i wonder where i can find the RAM chips necessary to drown out the evil to drown out the time the extra nothingness the time that it takes to sit there and dream and wish that you were elsewhere and i check the paper that’s been dangling on a fish hook in front of my face for some time now and i read the ads that have many attractive women wearing swimsuits and leaning seductively over computers with intel pentium processors and i find where i can purchase it and i ignore the ringing in the back of my head that speaks of my empty wallet and i visit and am greeted with a congratulatory crown of thorns and am told to carry my nebulous self-integrity and never. to look. back.   my neck. ow. but i can think through the pain, i suppose, though more than likely only a wee bit more than i was able to through the PLEASURE.   i am going to write. that. is. it. (changed your mind again, eh?) (shut up. ) do.   yawn. . i yawn and i’ve been writing so little but unlike before i haven’t even felt the urge to write about how little i actually want to write. and i don’t really understand it. . this is kind of similar to what happened to me at the end of kinetic anxiety, but i know i still have so much more of for whom the shadows thrive within me that has yet to be released. i don’t, however, have much of anything to write about now.   i’ve been sitting in my room lately. . sitting in my room, sleeping, not even writing that much anymore. i’ve been reading a bit more than usual, but most of that was done when i had to withstand such horrible pain just to keep my head up, just to continue existing at all… i just woke up from my comfy waterbed one night and it hurt to move my neck at all. it’s pretty much all better now, but it took all that nite and the next day for that to really happen.   my mother seems to suddenly think that i could get involved in some cult like the heaven’s gate people, since i spend so much time online and because she found that i was reading the satanic bible awhile back. . again, the idea that knowledge of something underneath what has become common knowledge (thanks to the news) is always evil. tell me, do i look to you like the kind of person who would be able to fool himself that he was finding answers in that sort of thing? the heaven’s gate cult was almost as bad as christian religions like catholicism… only not quite as bad, because they at least understood their beliefs, and they made sense to them. . and they knew where these ideas were coming from. . that, and they actually accomplished some good in this world by killing themselves.   anthology relative to? similar different collective individual small large packing… wonderment? i wonder at the reasons why but it’s all once again proven as i look myself in the eye and the reasons that the fictional characters cite as the greatest scapegoat in the history of mankind wither and die, leaving only my faint smile as a reminder of what once was.   and it’s proven again, for i am writing in school and i have plus or minus the square root of negative sixty-three. plus or minus? i… don’t. know.   “you believe that you can judge me accurately… you believe that what exists… is. . what. . exists. ”   there’s a lot to be distracted by, simply because of the fact that some things exist outside of my subconscious jurisdiction. i don’t feel that i should do unto others as i would wish them to do unto me, because i would really really antilove myself, did i exist outside of my subconscious jurisdiction (which, devastatingly enough, i don’t).   i don’t like writing in school (which i haven’t actually done in awhile, but which i’ve started doing again). the girls’ tennis team is meeting after school in room 313. hm. at least the teacher in this class speaks rather quietly. oh, even better, we have a test today (which i won’t take).   emotion sits in waiting “bored,” it screams, “fuck fuck fucking bored!” and i grin, and i tell it- “i. am aware of your work. ”   i’ve written about this subject elsewhere (just in conversation and in a post to the they might be giants mailing list actually, but to me that’s almost enough to wear out a topic. i get bored with things easily), but for the purposes of this thing, i’ll go over my ideas on this again. people will only complain about being objectified when the object they’re being seen as is something they don’t want to be. more often than not, people are so very ashamed of who they are- the fact that deep inside, they’re just sponges (occasionally, more like leeches). . and also the fact that they’re not perfect at all. which is why “love” and “relationships” can turn out to be so very devastating… they want to be considered the most beautiful, most perfect human being possible. they wish for objectification. . they wish to be seen as the only being who can really bring joy to the other’s life (because the other is seen as the only one who really understands- that that’s why the other can be loved, because they’ve been made out to be. . perfection). obviously, this is what is traditionally referred to as “love”… but, of course, it’s not the love of the actual being (which would bring about a much less definite relationship, one where the moods and changes in life could affect the amount of need for the other. . and make things less definite, and, for people in need of stability and commitment, hardly worth their time). the silly “relationship” that an average couple goes through usually will continue on until at one point one of the individuals (and i use the term quite loosely) will find that they’re not being satisfied, that the other is not living up to what they’ve been made out to be. . and at that point, usually they’ll try holding it back, saying that they’re not appreciating what they have, that the other is still a wonderful person. . basically denial. . and the typical ending to this would be when this causes similar questions in the other person about where the relationship is going (the other’s sudden uncertainty and such). . until eventually it just falls apart. this is just one scenario, of course, but a pretty frequent occurance. . sometimes it’s just one person using the other, while the other is the only one holding the person to be something they’re not.   i wonder why the ding ding ding-a-ling fuck yous question me and i wonder why i subject myself to so many projects at once when i can’t actually put my all into any of it and everyone thinks i’m not doing anything when i’m oh so busy writing reading programming creating my web site practicing guitar and chatting with my friends because so often they’re my inspiration and they keep me from fully slipping into a world devoid of self (which i seem to be in danger of doing). . i dunno, on one hand i look at my work and i look at my writings and i say to myself, “this is incredible to me. i’m displaying so much of myself, helping myself as well as creating something to look back on and to understand (and to help others understand)”. . but then i don’t really think that anyone could ever care… even though the reaction to the stuff i’ve put on my web site has been really really positive, i don’t know. they’re people who know me, they’re not. . they, um. . well. . most of the work done by people like my friends always seems so. . i don’t know. . it’s like i’ve read it before. . anyway, i don’t think my works could ever see print. . until i pick up a book of kerouac and wonder how it could ever have gotten published. the writing format. . so nifty. . so close to my style (though i’d never read him before i started writing any of this). . but jack kerouac the person seemed so very shallow… he was afraid of himself and didn’t seem to let anything out besides. . writings.   these are not writings.   the coffee beans sit with smiley faces painted on them. the tap water is time. . so what happens when the coffee pot overflows?   i wonder what i’d get from looking back on everything i’ve done and i know i wouldn’t like it but. . but i still have my eyes hurting and i still have a bunch of stuff i wrote in school that i haven’t typed out yet because it bores me and i really don’t think i want to lapse into an autobiographical section of this book (i’m having a heart attack now. . ah, okay, better) just yet. . so i’ll keep on doing whatever comes out but i don’t know, i really don’t know, and what ever happened to my antidogmas? um, i dunno. i’ve drowned everything. . drowned. . drowned… words. . words. . everything is gone everything is here and the words the words made sense once as they come to me but now they make so much sense that i’m starting to feel like michael crichton but i’m also starting to feel that having eyes on me for once isn’t a good thing because people you once thought might possibly have minds of their own kind of end up being nothing and being leeches (maybe sponges- simplistic sponges) bent on antiworlddomination (world-sponging). . and they proclaim that i’m just a hoarse voice screaming out something that they don’t understand but that they know it means something and they know they don’t my voice because they have their own. . right? an interesting change in one’s voice is noted as they speak of that, and i stand in hot bright sun on a cold wet hot dark and stormy night and i’m sad and i think i’m crying but who can really tell in the rain anyway and i stand underneath an umbrella but my fur smells. . and i rock back and forth and i rawk the world and i heal the world, make it a better place, for you and for me and the entire human race and i actually know the lyrics to that song… heal the world. well, it sounds nifty as a top 40 hit but what could come of actually trying to do so? and what needs to be healed? that poster that they had of “heal the world”. . that’s kinda funny. . that makes it seem like there’s something breaking humanity apart and that we should all bond together and that we should be friends but we should not be lovers and we should love one another but not give hugs for that would spread AIDS and we all need to come together. . i hate the idea of coming together because once again it brings up the way that everyone thinks. . gr. . that something is really disgusting because it is and that because it’s so horribly disgusting it doesn’t deserve to exist because it corrupts the moral fabric of the nation. the moral fabric of a nation! that’s like saying purple curtains should be banned because they clash with the colors of the american flag. it should, ideally, be individually decided what kinds of morals and doctrines and ideas and beliefs and bullshit that one will believe in, that one will hold to theirself. . but this nation, this society, declares that they will “protect” its denizens from the things that it doesn’t like. . not giving these people the chance to dismiss things by judging themselves how nifty or nasty any given thing, person, situation is… but instead disallowing the existence of things that the majority doesn’t like! why can’t child pornography be sold? “because it’s disgusting and those perverts should be shot,” i can hear as the universal answer to this question… “but,” i ask, “if it’s so disgusting, then shouldn’t everyone stay away from it?” “no, it’s where my children can see it. . they’re young and impressionable. ” “what kinds of impressions can pornography leave on children?” “that sex is okay. ” “and what’s wrong with sex that’s not wrong with a hug or a handshake?” “it’s a sin the couple isn’t married. ” hm. . and then they’re just allowing their views to be passed along to their children. . i feel so angry when i hear people say “i’m not really sure, i have some questions about the religion, i don’t really believe in it, but i’m a christian because my parents on. ” okay, i think these people deserve to be shot for not thinking the way i do, and i can say that because i’m a hypocrite and i don’t even care anymore. hey, read this and think about it and understand it or throw it away, just… eh. . use it for toilet paper if you wish, just (ack, itchy head)… and “well, why don’t you talk to me as much now that we’ve-“ “because there’s nothing to be said. and when i try, there’s nothing you wish to say. . maybe because there’s nothing you have to say. ” boy, i’m an asshole. i can love, but i don’t want commitment because that’s promising something you can’t promise, something you most likely will never be able to grant. . (one can only promise to pretend the continued existence of an unseen force that is pleasant to the other) burp. i love, and yet i. . hm. nudity. and love and lust are two separate things for lust is not capable for me in the presence of another human being for lust is, um. . i don’t think i have lust but what is lust maybe just a sick mirrored lower level of love cleverly disguised so the ones who don’t want to feel like scum can interpret their noncommital love as something. . other. . than. . “gee, adam, you sure do sound like you’re just making up a lot of excuses for your being excruciatingly human. ” “growl. shaddup. ” more itches. i don’t like itches. hey, neat, birdies are singing outside of my window. . snip. well, i’m going to school soon. ‘tis the early morning, how nifty. this past friday in school i wrote a bunch of autobiographical stuff for this, but i don’t like it so it won’t be here. oh well. i’m going to take off my heavy shirt thingie. . i’m hot.   i kick the rock and i kick my mind as it reassures me that i’m not quite what i’ve always believed i am, because i think of how neat it would be if i smoked cigarettes because then i wouldn’t be bothering with this rock, which is like a snowball only uncrushable. i had some pet rocks for awhile. their names were luna, sandy, sarah and janeane. (the space bar on my keyboard keeps sticking, and it really annoys me)   and again, as once, as ever, i’m confronted with the knowledge that i have nothing in my knowledge, and that i crave the things that i can see as the petty disintigration of the kinds of pleasures only one such as myself can fear. and i know that when i get right down to it that it’s really just the never-changing fact that everything is relative, and that any emotion can be such a wonderful thing when you’re always overwhelmed by so much reason… i know that if i were to give in and i were to deny it all and just exist for something. . exist for anything. . as i once existed for myself… (if i were able to ignore the fact that living for anything is. . well. . it’s… it’s the death of, the withering away of true love) i would not be able to feel the things i feel, and i would not be able to appreciate them the way i do. and as i take my mind for granted i would take my heart for granted, and as i take the inherant pleasure in my heart for granted, i would take the inherant pleasure in my mind for granted.   i still don’t know why i’m walking here. fleshing out the idea of why i’m walking around on such a cold night (hey, maybe it should start raining- that would add an even neater environment to this sitution). . such a cold and rainy night. . that would make too much sense. perhaps i’m only walking through these city streets (i hate the city). . in this kind of weather (i do, however, enjoy rainy weather. . though wind gets on my nerves) for the sheer joy of doing so.   i walk a bit but it’s different now than it used to be when i would take these kinds of walks. walks always used to seem like they were the only time when i could actually think and not be distracted by the otherworldly things that can exist only in this world, music, the voices in my head, the voices of others. . the voice of myself screaming that i really need to get to work on something that could be critically acclaimed as it argues with itself that it simply cannot work in that manner. now it seems like staying home is a break from the rest of the world, now that i see these people walking beside me, and i wonder why no one of my kind is out in such beautiful weather, why no one of my kind is out at all during the nighttime. . why no one of my kind is ever out at all.   my silent question is answered by the sound of nikeshighheelsdressshoes as they all walk as quickly as possible, so as to draw as much attention as possible, so as to get away, so as to become one with their surroundings, so as to… (where?) and i keep my hands in my pockets because i like them there and i suddenly get the urge to boingy a lot because i can understand how silly these humans are as i want to give them all big bear hugs, as i want to kill them, as i want to kill them only if they don’t want me to give them a hug, only if they won’t fear me and lick me and call me big brother.   and i think of the book that i wrote a long time ago (the book that i’m writing now), and i think of how horribly wrong it was, but i was a much different character back then anyway (i suppose). . and i’d thought that things would be so great in that they could be so wrong. . and i assumed that i would be nothing and that i’d just live my life drudging along and that i’d lose all my friends because i wouldn’t. . want. . i wouldn’t be able to appreciate their personal views on the way i massacred everyone who disagreed with my views. i thought that i would continue my existence as a silly little boy, that i would still think i would get along nicely with certain celebrities, that i would still think i could find meaning in the smashing pumpkins in tori amos in the calendar with subliminal satanic messages hidden in it. but i was quite wrong.   certainly now i’ve found that the only important things in this world can be found within oneself. . and yes, i’ve found that the universe revolves around me. . but i’ve also found that when you can see the past and present as clearly as i do (as jumbled as my views of the future may often be), and the unseen possibilities of the future fall collapse into the idols of the past. . you soon run out of things to romanticize. and you find that everything you need is where you are. . but that if you suddenly stopped what you were doing simply to enjoy the joy the joy the love of yourself of the world, the feeling of satisfaction of accomplishment. . it’s never enough. and i’ve found that i’m an artist, and i’ve found that i have no goals that i wish to reach. . simply because i’ve now reached the point where i don’t have to worry about any outside influences, because i can finally declare that the outside influences can only work positively towards me as i solidify my newfound acceptance of my being an artist as nothing can touch that any longer (for take away my art and you’ll unleash such a monster. . )   asking or telling: the objectification of a utopia. and what utopia is there, or ever was there? the idea that work may pay off? that experience might make my work better? that i could do everything everyone else dreams of and wishes they could do, and do whatever i want because i actually bother to work towards it? ha. . the objectification of a utopia. that’s exactly what i don’t do… perhaps “the objectification of a dystopia” would make more sense. . for i rarely hold positive things as rabbits to chase along the racetrack, i more often hold negative things as predators gaining distance behind me at an alarming rate. . so that, since desperate times call for desperate measures. . all time may be a desperate time. i still don’t smoke. i sense it.   adam faces himself in the mirror-that-doesn’t-exist, in the room-that-doesn’t-exist, which is filled with a blinding, endless pink light whose source is undeterminable.   adam moves to the left, and the reflection follows. adam moves to the right, and the reflection follows. adam sits down and begins to speak into the reflection. . he sees that his reflections’ lips do indeed move, but that his voice is the only true voice, the only one-who-can-be-heard. he flips off his reflection and the reflection flips him off… but somehow neither seem especially offended. adam offers a proposition to the reflection, which stands there without the slightest hint of curiosity touching its face. he offers to walk away from the mirror, and for the mirror not to follow him… he proposes that they both head off in their separate directions, and that they never think of each other again for as long as they exist. “if you have any objections,” says adam, “speak now or forever hold your peace. ” the mirror stays silent, and adam walks away. adam never again thinks about the mirror or the conversation he’d had with it. the mirror never again thinks about adam or the conversation he’d had with it. but unbeknownst even to the mirror itself, on its reflective surface remains adam’s reflection for the rest of all eternity.   forgotten fragments of past poetic ramblings unused, unwanted, unabsorbed into the shit that is my writing come to me. and it’s then that i finally realize that it never truly meant anything.

    "body": "Paper Clips: The Next Generation adam bit his lip as he stood at the ledge. how did he know this was the right thing to do? why forsake uncharted territory and instead regress into something whose meaning had been crushed so very long ago? somewhere inside his head a voice called out the answer: “revival. ” there was no way of telling how deep the chasm would be. . and he had no idea where he would wind up after a journey such as this. what kind of twisted form could the bottom of this gorge possibly manifest itself as? there was only one way to find out, he said to himself. and he leapt. from off of the pedestal he leapt, all the while trying to keep relatively certain that the camera was still on him, watching his every movement against the ever-increasing wind. he spread out his arms and his legs into a star-like formation, and the fierce flapping of his garments managed to show him just how turbulent the wind was now becoming. he glaced downward, hoping to find a bottom, but none was in sight. his acceleration grew all the more intense, until suddenly… “NEVER FEAR!” adam felt himself get snatched up in midair by something large, purple, and blurry. “oh, god, no. ” “YES! ‘Tis I, Superblob, defender of everything not-bad, and not-defender of everything bad!” Adam felt his mind, his ego, everything he’d been working for, suddenly sink into some obscure backwater region of his abdomen. . somewhere between his gall bladder and his liver. “Why. . ” he choked on the words. “Why have you come here?” “Why, to save you, of course!” “to save me from myself? to save me from finally attempting to find myself, and through finding myself, make a difference in this world, and accomplish something? to serve as yet another pathetic manifestation of all the silly, pointless ignorant waste that i’ve been trying to renounce through all these recent writings?” Superblob gave Adam a strange look. “Er, no, actually. . I’m here to save you from the paper clips. ” “…paper clips. ” Adam thought about this for a second. “somehow, that seems disgustingly appropriate… being the bottomless pit of content ignorance that it is…” “Bottomless Pit of Content Ignorance?!” exclaimed Superblob, “You’ve REALLY mixed up your stories here! That’s the Finite Pit Of Inevitable Death By Muliple Excrutiatingly Painful Stab Wounds Inflicted By Millions Upon Millions Of Paper Clips Bent On Multiverse Domination!… also known as The Bad Place!” “I. . see,” said Adam. but he didn’t see. . he didn’t see at all. and that was the problem. all he could see of the paper clips were what they represented in his own little world. . and perhaps the saddest part of it all was the fact that he knew this and understood this…. but that he felt himself helpless… helpless though he knew that it was impossible to be helpless. . he knew that he could change it all if he wanted to. . but helpless to the fact that he didn’t want to change this. . that. . that… adam suddenly heard a piercing, high-pitched squeal in his ears. he began to lurch about this way and that, immune to the fact that the arms of a purple blob were the only things keeping him from the certain death that awaited him below. “what of it, though?” he asked himself aloud. . “is death really that undesirable for me?” “why? why?! WHY?!” he screamed, and reality was broken, shattering like glass. . it shattered. . and the pieces fell… and adam fell… and adam for once didn’t shrink himself down to the size of the tiniest conceivable organism. . instead he said to himself, “reality is shifting! it’s the work of the evil sorceress appointed by…. ” the earth shook. “THE QUEEN OF HEARTS!” dramatic mood music blasted through the loudspeakers of life. existence slowed itself down to the fastest speed it could find in the phone directory. “einstein was wrong,” said a voice. “he believed that even thought could not travel more quickly than light. . but what light is there in this world, this reality, as you plummet not at 9. 8 meters per second, but rather so much more quickly that it becomes impossible that you could have been falling for so long without being on the complete opposite end of the universe? and how, you ask, is it possible that such a thing could occur without things looking completely different?” the clouds that had previously not been existence suddenly came into existence. . existence not only in the present but also in the past. . only for the past howeverlongadamhadbeenfalling they had now become oddly-shaped clouds, clouds that spelled out words, but never in any linear fashion. . no, for no photograph could ever picture any symbolic meaning in these clouds. . it was only the speed of adam’s descent into monosyllabic obscurity that showed for certain the words spelled out by these words. . and the words spoke at him these words: “deus. ex. machina. ” was it persistence of vision? was it creativity slash insanity slash divine inspiration slash witchcraft that was doing this to him? either way it was a truth that only he could know. and this brought a smile to his face as he saw the clouds change in front of his eyes… they changed into the shape of. . a picket fence. it stood about six feet tall, and on the other side stood a man. adam tried to make out the man’s features through the fence, but failed. the hand motioned now to a point far down the fence that had only been several feet in length before, which now stretched out for miles into the horizon. several meters down was the body of tim “the tool man” taylor, impaled on the picket fence. adam smiled once again. the fence which had been stationary but a moment before now began slowly to revolve. . adam’s position in space did not change at all, nor did the relationship of any of the parts of the fence, nor did the position and stance of the man who stood behind it. slowly but surely, the other side of the lawn was revealed. the man behind the fence wore a long, flowing cape and a mask over his bearded face. above his head floated a halo of light, and upon his head rested two horns. as soon as the significance of this set in for adam, the being melted into the grass without so much as a word. the fence faded away into nothingness, leaving no reminder of what once had been there. adam could not tell anymore where what had once been on either side of the fence now rested in this new world order. he merely sighed with understanding, and proceeded to ask: “why. have i not yet seen what is yet to be seen?”   m y v oyeur f lails how can you NOT understand what i say what i scream what i ALWAYS have wanted you to know to understand even as i never understood it for myself within my preoccupation with understanding it all?    to the one whom i know the best, to the one whom i’ve loved whom i’ve despised for the hatred i have of the theory of your own existence, for the spite i feel when i cannot convince myself that the antireason is only natural (why can i not understand that everything is natural?). . o the love i feel when i wish for it, when i want it, when i think that i can do something with it, when i don’t care if i can do nothing with it, for what is accomplishment in comparison to the monolith that towers over me? i don’t know how to explain the disappointment i feel in how irrevocable it all seems, that i might still be 15 forever as i am now as i will not be for much longer as i don’t care for i never was! what is age when experience is not experienced for the details but for the lowest common denominator? the definite limit to lowest common denominators. . when will i reach it, and what will i be then? a misshapen misanthrope forever doomed to understand the knowledge that nothing is worth it, that not even not caring is worth living for, but that dying for nothing for something is even more worthless pointless (such a loss, speaks the optimism of youth that has no place in the world of a meaningless one- such a loss of what could potentially be- that which might prove me wrong in the long run!)… i will grow old with this all as a simple idol of my past, forever there to guide me. . to tell me: “this can never be worth it again. ”     i understand the similarities, just how silly, how pointless, the dead, the dead, i love the dead, and the buddy rarely for the sun and the thoughts of oddness and the level that i would be, @emptybottlewiththeholesalongthebottom. com, and i understand why i can never love. and part of myself laughs it off while part of myself fears what is coming up next.     as the face shall forever be smeared and blackened, as you are forever kicked in the ass by the old man of sardonic inspiration, but as you understand what you have even as you don’t understand what you wish for. somehow the subtlety seems appropriate for myself. the significance inherent is not likely to set in just yet. . and so i shall sum my thoughts up in a requiem for the damned and the loved and the scorned and the realization that infant euthanasia is quite all right, no matter how swunky…. yet another step towards eternal hatred.  labrador retrievers throw caution into the wind and i spit on you and tell you that nothing you can say will ever exist in the present tense… for only i exist in the present tense. sound waves light waves what is the infinite and why is the rest so false and how can it be possible to live in now while taking into consideration the outside world, whose truth already has been destroyed by the fabric of time? you ask what it means, but the only truth that exists is in the present tense, and truth is contradictory by nature, for all that is “truth” is what is believed to be truth as it is used as the foundation of the future, of the past, of the high-redshift areas of the ever-upward and downward-expanding force of the big bang’s expulsion of time… I HATE ALL OF YOU! my writings. . everything. . because i don’t write for myself, i could never write for myself, because everything is counterproductive, i tell you. . everything. and you insult me by worrying about hurting my feelings, accusing me of having feelings. . and i’m being drawn back into it again, it seems… kinetic anxiety part 4 just might actually happen…. .   untelevised title bout don’t FEEL that the alienation doesn’t disturb you as you find yourself alone DEAD no one anywhere to help you simply because they want to and you realize that you are not one but you are two but you are several thousand QUESTION the authority of yourself over yourself as you realize that in the end there is no self and that to even desire something to want to desire is all because as you go on about how sorry it is that they all need to have something to work for to dream of to hang in the air over their heads to salivate to laminate to know that in the end there is nothing left but choosing a path, and why not the path of least resistence, for there is no such thing as intellect when you finally realize that knowledge is as true a path to salvation as is calvin klein as is anne rice as is the bog of eternal stench   BURST the bubble filled not with air but with water.   _____during their youth, males are considered by default to be scum. forced to destroy everything that’s been solidified as their own personality in order to be accepted by anyone at all. they know nothing about friendship, they forever must continue their search for “what do i believe in? i need to find what i believe in, then it’ll be Truth”. . they’re used to compromising themselves, eventually there’s no self left in them. . they seem so false, so phony to me, all the time… which is why i tend to feel very frustrated around them. they don’t develop the emotional response that dictates good and bad like females do, instead they react the way they believe they should react. .   during their youth, females are considered by default to be perfectly fine. they tend to have people to fall back on, one friend or another. . allowed to act the way they want, but if they break certain boundaries they’ll be suddenly turned on and have what once was a friendship reduced to nothing… yet still having other friends to say that they were meanies anyway. having real friends, unlike males, and being able to turn on another in a moment, their friends become the only real special thing to them (“oh, everything’s so hectic and confusing, but you’re my friend and you understand”), and when, for an example, a guy breaks up with this friend, the friend who was broken up with is sad… seeing one side of the story, getting used to there being only one side of the story, seeing sadness as bad and happiness as good, not seeing the intentions or the means, but rather letting the emotions effected by the ends dictate what’s good and what’s bad. also, seeking stability in relationships: wanting to feel certain that they will forever be Right makes them happy. Truth within a relationship, if saddening, is “bad”, and therefore has no place in it. Unconditional love? On the receiving end. On the giving end, the guy’s used to this, giving what he thinks he should give, feeling how he thinks he should feel…   _____you know how it is when you have far too much energy to remain awake don’t you? a sponge afraid of water until he finds it and accepting reluctantly the truth of his nature under the                       one           condition that he destroy what he once considered plausible for it is now forever for now obsolete. i am certainly not happy, and yet what have i become now? have i reached the opposite of the once of the ever for then for no longer? to accept it with grace that i know. and. therefore must. puzzle the rest of the world and myself and behind it all hide that myself is a being, emotions and flailing around as i fall it’s a pit that i’m falling through how and the why and the ack once again??? why. must. i. think. i. must? …why must i be? whatever happens as my fingers fall off? oh, once again… my head pounds and it’s based in the flow of it all once again and i’m NOT myself for i have no self. . what is self. . who am i? another me has taken over. i’m the one who wants to know WHY but i don’t want to know it and i FEEL LIFE i saw her dancing in a bar one fine night down by the bay and i felt a sudden pain in my spine and my spine has decided to abandon all metaphors as it SHATTERS into a million fragments and i wonder. where. all the fiction. has gone.

I’m gonna kill my parents on my twelfth birthday, so I guess I’ll just have to wait until then to kill them, and conquer the world and enjoy puberty! -FIN August 1, 1994. I just found this thing while going through some of my old junk. My god, I was funny even back then! Cool! Have I lost my sense of humor? No, I just kinda forgot. -Adam M. Ares Your momma’s so fat, she went on a diet! What’s today’s date? August something, 1994. Today may be the last day I write in this journal. Three of my partners on this expedition have passed on, and I fear I may be next. Stockholm and I are all that’s left. I feel sad not for myself but for my family. My children will never have a father to look up to. -Adam M. Final Entry 	Mar. 29, 1995. Dear paper, Alright, I found this thing again, and I’m writing in it. Let’s see… what’s new in my life? I’m reading Cerebus, which is cool. I want to do MY WORLD and publish it and become famous. Yeah. Right. I’m hoping to get that done before my birthday, which is only 23 days away- You know, I haven’t even done a b-day list yet? I’M INSANE! I’m sorry. This is all wrong. I’m not being STUPID! What kind of monster have I become? Oh well. Atomic Comix is cool. Hmm… I’m trying to keep this stupid while still adding little thingies about my life in 8th grade, but it’s not working that well. IT’S NOT THAT I CAN’T BE STUPID NO MORE, rather that… um…. Well, here’s what I was like in ‘95. Kind of. Okay. Bye. -Adam M. Ares, A. K. A. The Claustrophonic Agoraphobic, A. K. A. Airhead, A. K. A. Mr. Anonymous 9/5/95. Okay. Here I am. Tomorrow I start High School, completely different. Seriously. I have my Demented Press, and I really don’t feel like gratuitous stupidity in places where it shouldn’t be– like reality. Yeah. So here’s my pretty much yearly entry here– this is turning out pretty cool, I just write in this whenever I find it. Usually when I clean my room. -Adam M. Ares, A. K. A. Adam M. Ares "

    "body": "Two cars, speeding at 5 light years per minute. They collide, sending debris all over. Unfortunately, the accident happened between Mars and Venus close to Earth. “Why am I angry?! Why?! Isn’t it kind of obvious?” said Andromenda, the representative of the Eastern Hemisphere of Earth, “Your Marsmobile crashed with some Venusian auto! Now Earth is covered with those things!” “Listen,” said Bugaloo, the leader of Mars, “We can’t take responsibility for an accident one of our innocent citizens was involved in. But in my good nature as the leader of Mars I present you a check for $50,076,600,905. 95 to cover 37% of the damages. Why don’t you go talk to Lunari, the leader of Venus? Maybe he’ll give you more cold cash. ” “Thanks,” said Andromenda, “I appreciate it. ” So, Andromenda took off for Venus. When he finally reached the palace of Lunari, he was asked for identification. “I don’t have any,” explained Andromenda, “But I must see Lunari. ” “You must have identification,” stated the security device. Andromenda was immediately transported back to the spaceship dock. He had to get in. But how? He thought and thought and thought, etc. Finally, he decided to try telepathy. Please hear me, oh grand Lunari! I must talk to you! Thought Andromenda. “Please insert one quarter of ten thousand dollars for the first minute. The slot shall appear in front of you in sixty milliseconds. Please wait. ” “I’m out of change!” yelled Andromenda. He traveled back to Earth. Debris was everywhere! He couldn’t stand it any more. He took a walk to the Village Cloud Library. He looked up Lunari in an encyclopedia. Hmmm… thought Andromenda while sleeping at a hotel that night, he is very caring, and is known to give away thousands of dollars just for ha-has. Unfortunately, Earth did not have a phone book that listed Venus’s telephone numbers. That’s it! I’ll go to Venus, call for an appointment, and-no. I’d need an identification. Drat. That’s it! I’ll get change for a million and use telepathy to contact Lunari! Perfect! The next morning before Andromenda could get change, the stock market crashed. Millions were fired, and the United Planets Association shut down. When Andromenda asked the owner of the hotel for change, he pointed a gun at Andromenda! “Out! Out!” he yelled. It was the owner’s fault for not giving the rooms cable 4-D T. V. Finally, at long last, Andromenda discovered the bad news at a newspaper stand. Absolute bummer. Then, there was a light at the end of the dark tunnel. He found a quarter ten-thousand dollar coin. “Hey!” yelled a gigantic hoodlum, “That’s my change. ” Andromenda easily made the decision to give him the money, turn around and run. Great. This was a pretty big problem. In fact, very big. Andromenda decided to take a walk to clear his head. His destination was Awesome Park. He walked on the water, then sat down ON it. He didn’t get the least bit wet. It didn’t startle him because he forgot to take off his multi-purpose boots. He didn’t bother taking them off. Walking on it was fine. But then, he saw a quarter ten-thousand dollar coin under the water! He took off his boots and dived in. After getting the coin, Andromenda climbed onto the land and started to use telepathy, but the voice of the operator said, “Sorry, your call cannot be completed. Here is your money back. ” Then Andromenda got an idea. He would apply for a job as a janitor for Lunari! Then he could talk to him. Three weeks later, Andromenda was working for Lunari! It was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it. Andromenda never knew how hard being a janitor could be. “Hey, hey, guy! You missed a spot!” laughed some guy with no respect for others. Andromenda held back his anger. He didn’t want to lose this job! Later that day he would make his move. While working, he met up with an old friend, Abe Lincolnano, who was the Prime Minister of Canada at that time. “Well, Andromenda,” said Abe, “How have you been doing? Fancy meeting you here!” “I can’t believe this! You know, I’m now the representative of the Eastern Hemisphere! I’m here to talk to Lunari! Don’t tell anyone, but I’m going to sneak into his office. ” “You’ve got to be kidding! Since I’m the Prime Minister of Canada, I’m doing the same thing with my phony identification card! Hey! Come in with me!” “Well, sure!” cheerfully answered Andromenda, “So I did all this janitor work for nothing!” The two were soon walking towards the office of Lunari. “Identification, please! Thanks. You may-wait a second! This is an unlicensed card! It’s a fake! Come on, guys! Let’s show these two out!” “Hey!” yelled Abe, “I want to get in there! I am the Prime Minister of Canada on Earth, and I demand you let me in!” Andromenda shoved the guard away. But that didn’t help matters by much. The other guards came rapidly with stun rays. Abe kicked the gun out of one guy’s hand, causing him to run away in fear. Abe picked up the gun. “Andromenda! Catch!” “Thanks!” yelled Andromenda as Abe passed the gun over to him. Our hero Andromenda charged into the office. “Sir!” he yelled, “I need money for Earth for damages from an auto accident!” “What do you mean? Guards, remove him from my sight!” Lunari stepped out from behind his desk. What small feet! Andromenda was forced out. But why? “What did you do?” asked Abe, who had also been captured, “Step on his big feet?” “He had small feet!” “Oh yeah. I forgot,” said Abe, “Did you punch his big nose?” “He had a small nose!” “No, I’m sure he has a small nose by his picture. ” “Lunari is a fake! I have proof!” yelled Andromenda, “I…” “No! That was a picture of my brother! The leader dude does have a small nose!” Lunari stepped out. “What’s this?” he asked. “Why won’t you give me money for the auto accident?” “Auto accident? I thought you said lotto accident! I’ll give you both a few hundred million dollars. ” AND SO, EARTH NOW DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE A SMALL NEW YEAR’S CELEBRATION OF 2070. ANDROMENDA SPENT THE REST OF THE DAY SLEEPING LIKE A LOG. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO ABE. * *Translated from Excaloo, the Universal Language "

Matthew and Sophia would be in one show, and Melissa and I would be in the second. Soon after that, I was in the Spelling Bee. After about a half hour of words on the brain, I took home the first place trophy. I was in the paper for the TV program, and my picture was in it for the Science Fair. (third place in my category) Then it was April 11, the day of the TREASURE MASTER contest. I got the password from MTV. I played, and I would have won $10,000. 00 if the password hadn’t been wrong. Then came the day when my REACH teacher announced that since our project won 1st place in the state, we would go on an all-expense paid trip to MIT. Man. I was psyched! On the trip, the bus broke down, and we had to wait for another bus to come from Chicopee. Then I could only go to the Aquarium and Quincy Markery. NOT THE MUSEUM! At MIT, I farted on stage, and my picture of our plaque didn’t develop right. Then we got the phone call at school. We had won the National competition. Five, and only five of us were invited to the University of Wisconsin via plane for for days without parents for five days. Wouldn’t you know it, I wasn’t invited. I couldn’t get over it. I was the best in the REACH class. I knew it. Zachary kept rubbing in the fact that he could go, and I told him he would soon have a bad luck streak. His minor believe has started one, a little bit, And my bad luck seems almost over. Maybe I’ll be able to go to Wisconsin. But I doubt it. I’ll probably find out tomorrow. THE END? TO BE CONTINUED?   5/18/92 I didn’t find out. I just hope I’ll be able to go. It means too much to me for me to forget. Maybe I’ll look back at this and laugh, but I’d better not.   7/92 I didn’t go, but I got over it. I’m not laughing, though. Life’s better now. Nothing’s standing in my way, except for my parents, who’re always bugging the heck out of me. I just got Street Fighter 2 for the Super Nintendo- a great advancement in technology. Since it’s the summer, I miss living the exciting life of a school kid, but I’m throwing a party just to get us all together. "

    "body": "Friends, Romans, countrymen: This little piece of art is: LIFE SUCKS MY BIOGRAPHY Oh, joy! Sit down, get naked, and listen to 90% of my secrets and stuff. (A guy’s gotta keep SOME things private, you know?) Well, I was born on April 22, 1981 in Providence Hospital in Holyoke, Massachusetts. But Adam, you say, Why were you not born in your hometown of Chicopee, Massachusetts? Because this was the closest hospital. THERE WASN’T ONE IN CHICOPEE! (That didn’t need to be capitalized) And Holyoke’s a pretty rough place, overall. At least my mom wasn’t carjacked when she was on her way to have me. That would’ve kinda sucked. But, hey, LIFE SUCKS. Okay. Though I obviously don’t remember my living quarters at 7 months old, I hear that my parents moved a few times before my brain started to work. (That’s a joke. My brain worked, okay? It’s just my way of mentioning that when you’re young, you don’t exactly have a genius I. Q. That took took me until I was eight. I’m kidding! Nine. ) And when my parents moved, I went with them. I still needed a little help learning job skills (such as counting to five), so I decided to hang out with them for a little while longer. Finally,we came to the only apartment I remember. Actually, it was one of those two-family deals with drunken landlords who have a sadistic little brat. Of course, in my naïve innocence, I didn’t notice the Satan in the kid’s eyes. I was spoiled immensely come Christmas and my birthday, and my father gave me tic-tacs all the time so that I thought they were candy for another four years. Oh fudge, I forgot to mention that I was three or four around this time. More like 3 ½. That way it’s a compromise. But I digree- I didn’t know what that meant at three and a half years old. Actually, I didn’t understand that until I was about eleven or twelve. Uhm…I would always go to this park nearby, and a convenience store that I called Li’l Peach even though it was something else. (Why I didn’t realize it wasn’t a Li’l Peach, I have no clue. I could read, more or less. That was not a joke, if you were wondering. I don’t remember not being able to read. It’s weird. I mean, most people don’t remember not being able to talk, (or am I the only one?) but have at least a bit of a reccollection of not knowing how to read- or I may be wrong. But I was always a prodigy- not the computer on-line service, the adjective, you stupid dork!) And then I moved. To my present home. Hold on- pause for station identification. These are not memoirs. Just a thought. What they are are documentations showing how much my LIFE SUCKS. Hold on, next page: At my new home, the old guys who lived here had a dog and left a wonderful dirt pit where their dog’s house was. The dog, chained up, made the circle thing, you know? At least that’s what I think it was. It could have been an alien spacecraft. Well, whatever made it, my ever-stupid (though he was just about as smart as me then, so I didn’t realize his stupidity just then. Besides, he showered me with gifts whenever we went out- I didn’t know that my mom brought in Santa’s presents. Ow. Not that I didn’t respect her or nothing, but I knew that going out with Lenny-I mean, my dad-would get me better stuff. I didn’t realize that my mom realized what saving up money meant. And if it seems like I’m being hard on my father, I am. He’s a moron! He’s insane! He was most likely in his high school class to wind up in an institution! He’s psycho extraordinaire! At least I didn’t wind up like him-I’m just a wee bit demented. Hey, I’ve been through hell, much of which is in the 10% I won’t tell you, so I think I have a right to be a freak of nature! Yeah! Power to the weirdos! Except for Lenny-my father, I mean. ) Then along came school. I know what you’re thinking: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH! HEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPPP! But no, not at all. Wait! I forgot something! Backtrack! No, forget it. What I was thinking of comes later. Silly me. WAIT! I haven’t told you about my extremely large and sometimes confusing family! (Hey, I’m large and confusing, too! Wow! What a coinkidink!) My Meme (French for Grandma, you morons!), who’s on my mom’s side (we’re starting with my mom’s side ‘cause they’re the cool ones). Wait, where was I? Oh yeah. Meme. (None of those funny punctuation thingies are on this word processor, so I can’t get it right. Sorry to all Frenchmen and Mees everywhere. Excedpt for you Native American Polish Spanish Puerto Rican New York Frenchmen-I don’t trust you. ) Now, my Meme was…my Meme. Our second house (No, that’s not it-my current house) was on the same street as my Meme’s house, so that was cool. My cousins Chris and Ken (a. k. a. “The Twins”, because, well, they’re twins) were down there-ow! My neck hurts! Um, Chris and Ken were down at my Meme’s pretty much all the time because their parents, my aunt Brenda and my uncle Dave- had a business to run, and they couldn’t very well leave their little kids-who were five months older than me- home alone at, like, five years old. Also in the family were my cousin Amy (three months younger than me-everyone in my family got pregnant at one wicked big party in 1980), who had only her mom, my aunt Renee (again I have no weird accent thing) (Hey, “Aunt Renee” looks pretty weird written on paper) Amy’s housing arrangements changed every couple of weeks, but…man, ever have one of those sentences you never know how to end? They changed every couple of weeks, but coffee ice cream makes a good laxative. There. A perfect ending to a perfect sentence. Speaking of endings, (Editing note: the rest of this is missing. ) "

I knew this wouldn’t last long, though. I knew that I had to break out. So, one night when the guard was asleep, I left. The door to the cell wasn’t even locked. As I walked down the street in clothes straight from the garbage, I noticed a scratch ticket on the ground. It wasn’t even touched. I picked it up, scratched it, and found out I had won $9,999. 99. I brought it to the nearest newstand and got the cash. Six hours later, I was in the arcade playing Mortal Kombat 3. I had already spent seventy-five dollars on it. Then I beat a big guy with a gun under his hat. He grabbed me by the colar. The next thing I remember is lying in a gutter with a note on my head. It said, I’m sorry you passed out when I gave you that hug. Here’s the number to the jail. Bail me out, please.  -Harry I ignored the note and went to a fancy Chinese restaurant. I ordered the cream of Sum Yung Guy. After being kicked out, I headed to the movies to see “White Men Still Can’t Jump”. Then a flying pig with a horn impaled me. THE END   Welcome to the Real World Welcome to the real world, With guns and drugs and sex. Welcome to the real world, Where everyone’s the best. Welcome to the real world, Do you think it is too gritty? Welcome to the real world, There ain’t an ounce of pity! Welcome to the real world, Where all you need is knowledge. Welcome to the real world, Hey, let’s all go to college! This isn’t the real world, Now everything is different. Welcome to the wrong world, You’ll be spending your life here.   Me (10/25/1994) I’m sitting here in room #214 during second period and looking at the sheet describing what to write in this composition. My name is Adam, my nickname is Adam, and I’m 13 years old. I live with my mother, because my father moved to South Carolina. That’s not anything negative, though, because I couldn’t stand him. I also have no brothers or sisters. I need to write about my hobbies, but I don’t know where to start! I collect and read comic books, as opposed to just collecting and not reading them. I also play video games, listen to music, watch the television, and hang out with my cousins, Chris and Ken Rooney, who live in Greenfield. You want me to brag? No problem! I took the SAT last year through a program I’ve forgotten the name to. I scored higher than the average college-bound 12th grade student on it, and received a certificate for it. It wasn’t as hard as I had expected it to be. When it comes to video gaming, I’m also great. One major disappointment, though, came last summer when I entered a Blockbuster Video game tournament. I went there and had incredibly bad luck. I had never played the games as badly as I did there. I only wound up taking fifth place in the store, which was embarrassing. I went with my REACH group to M. I. T. In fifth grade, and the entire group delivered a speech about the community problem solving program we were receiving an award for. I like to hang out in malls, especially with my aforementioned cousins. How do I spend my free time?! I already covered that when I wrote about my hobbies! I like me because I’m cool. My best subjects are everything, and my worst subject is nothing. Well, actually, it depends on the teacher. In seventh grade my grades weren’t that great, but I was well behaved. My grades will be next to perfect this year, and yes, I hope to get out of Bellamy.   As a Baby… (English assignment) I was perfect. At least, I was for the most part. I was born at 11:05 in the morning at Providence Hospital in Holyoke on April 22, 1981. I was 22 inches long and had a little bit of messed-up hair. I was ugly and round and had blue eyes. I was well-behaved (I told ou, I didn’t cry, I wasn’t a fussy eater at all, and I didn’t want to be held because I liked being a loner. It was three days until I left the hospital and came home, and when I got there I was still perfect. Since I have three cousins who were born between November of ‘80 and June of ‘81, my aunts, uncles, et cetera were too busy taking care of their young ‘uns to pay any attention to my birth. There are no horror stories from this time because I was perfect.   Terrible Twos (English assignment) I learned to walk when I was one year old, and I was still perfect. The only real mischief I caused was playing in my mom’s cabinets constantly. I hardly ever threw temper tantrums or anything. I did have one problem, though– I wouldn’t go to sleep! I would always stay up late at night. I loved watching “Knight Rider”, and I remember falling asleep during Hill Street Blues a lot. To recap, I was perfect, and I was the perfect child. I was perfect, perfect, and perfect. Don’t you wish you had a kid that was as good as me? I bet you do. Everyone does. I am having a really hard time stretching this out, so I’ll stop trying. Bye.   I Have a Room My room is painted a peach color because it used to be an extra room in my house. I moved into it a few months ago from my older room. It’s sometimes messy and sometimes clean. It depends on what day you look at it. I have two TVs in my room- one used to be in our living room, but now I use it for playing video games on. The other used to be my mom’s, but now I use it to watch TV on. A VCR is hooked up to the latter. Underneath my bed are boxes of comic books, and I’m starting to run out of room there for them- within a couple of years I’ll have to find another place for them. This last paragraph is not necessary, for the most part, but I feel I should have a finishing paragraph. I spend a lot of time in my room, and it’s cool. This is the last sentence.   The news: June 21, 2009 Hello people, and welcome to the paper. Jeffery Dahmer’s brain has reportedly grown arms and legs and walked out of the morgue, armed and dangerous. If you happen to see it, STEP ON IT IMMEDIATELY. Otherwise it will sic a sasquatch on you like it did to the late, great Janet Reno. Oh well. On a lighter note, President elect Adam Ares has shaken off that darn alien abduction problem. Apparently, the alien that was thriving in his digestive system was melted when Adam ate Roxanne’s nose, mistaking it for the slime layer at the top of a can of Spam. Adam is reportedly in happy condition at the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane. Daniel Aparviz, best known for his expose “Dick Van Patten: Saint or Anti-Christ?”, was killed yesterday as the corpse of Roseanne fell out of the broom closet of his summer home on the island of San Francisco. His last words were, “Shiver me timbers! It’s Moby Dick!” A public memorial will be held in South Africa, where Daniel never visited in his entire life as an overpaid, overpublicized writer and marine biologist. This just in: the world is about to blow up, and the only living humans left will be the ones on Saturn. Bye. BOOM! "

    "body": "The Paper Clip Trilogy (1. The Paper Clip of Death) Paper clips may not seem all that useful, but what you need to remember is that they have feelings too. I know. I’m talking from experience. I never used paper clips very often. They would just sit around all day, bored out of their… well, they don’t have minds, so forget it. One day, the bad apple of my paper clips, Bobby, decided to take out all of his frustration and boredom out on me. He jumped out of the box and leapt his way to my bedroom. My door was locked, so he stretched himself out, forced himself into the keyhole, and picked the lock. He saw that I was sleeping, so he climbed up onto my bed. Asleep, I was completely at his mercy. Unfortunately for me, he had no mercy. He didn’t want to kill me right away, though. He wanted to see me suffer, like he had for years, so he stabbed me in the eye. I woke up and instinctively pulled him out, screaming. Before I could throw him against the wall, though, he buried himself in the palm of my hand. He bent himself into a staple-like form, so when I ripped him out, I took off some of my skin with it. This time I was faster than it. I threw it onto the floor, then got out of bed. It ran underneath my foot, and I stepped on it. I bent over and grabbed my foot. It was gone. It had leapt onto me and climbed up to my head. Before I could react, it climbed through my ear, pierced my brain, and killed me. If paper clips could laugh, it would have. (2. The Return of the Paper Clip) Adam Ares, age 14, died last year under mysterious circumstances- his brain was pierced by… something. Now, eleven years later, new evidence has linked his dead to that of seven other children in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Experts believe that a paper clip was used to kill all eight of these victims. It has been suggested that O. J. Simpson may have had a role in these murders. Simpson’s attorneys refused to comment on the allegations made by journalists from several major newspapers, but inside sources say that O. J. is nervous and possibly even suicidal. On a lighter note, Daniel Aparviz, the boy wrongly accused of the murder of Adam Ares, had his sentence of death by Egyptian torture methods carried out last night. He will be missed. This just in… a paper clip riding a tank armed with thousands of megatons of nuclear explosives has been sighted in Jurassic Park. He is believed to be working for O. J. Simpson as a way to avenge the downfall of communism. Mr. Simpson, who is believed to be the horseman of the apocalypse known as Pestilence, is loved by none and hated by all. His trial is set to end in the year 2005. Wait, we have just received word that the paper clip has detonated the explosives and destroyed all of New England and most of the areas surrounding the Great Lakes. O. J. Simpson strikes again. (3. Raiders of the Lost Paper Clip) I am Ranger Rob, and I’m on a mission. A mission to find Noah’s favorite paper clip from biblical times. Ever since I was born Robert Barabani 23 years ago, I had dreamed of being a park ranger who searches for priceless treasures in his spare time. Now that this dream has become a reality, I have finally been able to get a girlfriend. Her name is Kathy Irelandish, and she finds me beautiful. That’s because I am. That’s what my mother tells me, too. I found out about the paper clip I now seek by accident. I was walking by a church when a page from the Pope’s new book, “The Bible II: The Second Coming” flew in my face. I read it, and it had information about the paper clip, which Noah used with his plans for the ancient ark. I received a tip yesterday about the location of the p. c. - Mars. I packed my clothes and headed off into space. When I got to Mars, some alien greeted me with a high five. I punched it in the face when acid began to disintegrate my flesh. That’s when I saw it. It was embedded in a large stone, and was glittering in the hot hot sun. I stepped up to it, and tried to pull it out. I tugged hard, but I couldn’t get it out of the stone. Finally, I pulled out a ray gun and shot myself in the head. I then discovered that I was invincible. I ran around, headless, and fell to the Martian ground. I now have to live without a head.   ‘Twas (Dec 19, 1994) ‘Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house not a creature was stirring, except Mighty Mouse. Teddy bears were hung by the chimney with care, in the hopes that my teacher soon would be there. The kittens were nestled all snug in their kitty mansions while visions of a kitty litter that worked danced in their heads. Jeffrey Dahmer’s brain in its glass jar and I taking a nap both were really big brains and taking long naps. From the TV downstairs there arose such a clatter, I sprang to the roof to see if there was a problem with the antenna. There was a moon on snow and stuff, and I was far below. Then what to my really sleepy eyes should appear but a really big sleigh right on top of my antenna! EPILOGUE: Santa Claus was fined $500 for trespassing and destruction of private property, and is carrying out a sentence of 7 years under house arrest at the North Pole. Tim Allen, who was supposed to take his place as gift-giver, quit. A new gift-giver has not yet been chosen.   The Incredible Story of Sto the Wonder Cow (Dec 23, 1994) Sto was a student at Bellamy Middle School. No one liked him because of his mental illness. One day, as he was walking in the halls between classes, he came across Mrs. Leonard. “Hi, Mrs. Leonard,” he said. She hated him with a vengeance, and just hearing his voice was the straw that broke the camel’s back. “That’s it!” she yelled, “I’m sick of you, Sto! You like to moo? Well, you can moo forever! My witchcraft will transform you into a cow for all eternity!” That day Sto the Middle Schooler was changed into Sto the Wonder Cow. “And your friend, Pid!” Mrs. Leonard continued, “He can hang out with you forever! I’m banishing you to Antarctica!” “Moo,” said Sto. In a flash, Sto the Wonder Cow and his friend Pid were warped instantly to Antarctica. And the world would always be the same. Now, the two wander the emptiness of Antarctica, Sto a naked cow, and Pid wearing a t-shirt and jeans. They would like to wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, but they don’t like you.   A Day in the Life of a Jawbreaker (Jan 4, 1995) I’m bored. I mean really, really bored. I’ve been alive for only a couple of minutes, but I’m already bored. This laying down on a conveyor belt thing is really getting old. Yawn. OH MY GOD! What is that big awful thing?! I’m headed right for it- and I’m a piece of candy- I can’t move! NO! NO! NOOOOOO! I’m wrapped in plastic! Help! Help! I’m suffocating! I don’t wanna die! I’m only two minutes old! Waaait a minute. I thought the world was round. If it is, then WHY AM I ABOUT TO FALL OFF OF IT?! AAAA! OOF! Whoa. It’s dark in here. I guess it’s a box. Well, at least it’s an open box. Hey, who’s that guy? And… oh… LOOK AT ALL THESE DEAD JAWBREAKERS IN HERE! No! Don’t close the box! Please! No! Put away the tape! NOOOOOO! I guess I’m going to die, so I might as well do it in my sleep. Good night. Zzzz…. . Good morning. …. . …. . HEY! I’M ALIVE! And the box isn’t moving anymore! Cool! It’s still dark, though. Hey, did I hear what I think I did? YES! I’m being freed! The box is opening! Hi, little girl! Thanks for helping me! Oh, you want to pick me up and free me? Thanks! Oh! Thanks. That wrapper was horrible! Um… what are you… get me away from your mouth! NOOOOOOO! THE END   The Happy Titanic, Starring Billamuckalockappamoocha, or Billy for Short Wednesday, April 10. After being on this strange little planet for only two days, I would have to say that these Humans are really primitive, but their fashion sense is incredible. They have something called “pants” here on Earth, and it adds a lot to a person’s wardrobe. I saw many pairs of pants today as I boarded the watership Titanic. The humans’ minds are easily controlled, so I had no problem getting a first class room. Excuse me, I must now sleep. Zzzzz… Thursday, April 11. I gave a shot a thing call liquor. I happy really happy. Except how I regurgitate over side of boat. That sickening. Excuse, must now pass out. Friday, April 12. I found out that Humans don’t have the power of telekinesis today. I saw a dolphin in the ocean and used my powers to life it out of the water and into my room. Needless to say, they began to try to terminate my life functions through the use of wooden planks and knives. I didn’t have to kill anyone today, which made me happy. I take no joy in making inferior races scream as I kill them slowly and mercilessly. Excuse me, I must now drain my bladder. Saturday, April 13. I just read a good book called “Titan”, and I got a weird feeling of Deja Vu. I saw a Human Woman today, and I wanted to talk to her. When I walked up to her, though, she screamed and kicked me in the head. Surprisingly, it hurt. I’m still bleeding now, seven hours later. Ow. Sunday, April 14. The ship is sinking, everyone’s screaming, the band’s playing country music, and my antennae hurt. I’m having a really bad day. I guess the humans are, too, especially considering the fact that they can’t fly. It’s horrible to see these animals dying. It’s really awful. Monday, April 15. The ship is about to sink, so I’m going back home, where everyone is perfect and our three suns warm us daily. Bye-bye!   Jobs (English assignment) (Feb 3,1995) An easy job for a young person to get is at a restaurant, especially a fast food place like McDonald’s. These jobs don’t require experience, and it’s a good place to work until you can find better work. Either that, or you can stand on a street corner singing “I’m Every Woman” and hope that someone will give you a quarter and not punch you in the face to shut you up. I like the McDonald’s idea better, though.   All Dogs Go To Heaven…??? (Feb 5, 95) If a dog dies, parents will tell their children that it’s gone to Dog Heaven. (Unless it’s a really dysfunctional family, and the parents tell their child that the dog is in Dog Hell for wetting on the carpet. ) But what is the truth about Dog Heaven? I recently took a trip to this mysterious place to find out the truth. In Dog Heaven, the rejects from Cat Heaven are chased constantly, as are those cars not fit for Car Heaven. The landscape of this place is a beautiful plain with plenty of trees and fire hydrants popping out of the greenery. Televisions playing “Homeward Bound” and “Lady and the Tramp” hover in the sky. Ruling over this kingdom is Dog God, whose name is Foofur. He was the dog of Adam and Even, and he makes sure everything runs smoothly in his land. The dogs looked at me strangely, which my tour guide said was because human’s mouths are too dirty for their tastes. One poodle actually called me a “Milk Bone-less-mouthed monkey”. When I pet a cute little black lab on the head, he snapped at me and told me never to demean him like that again. When I finally met Dog God, he made me eat a Milk Bone. I enjoyed it so much that I asked for another, but he wouldn’t give me one. He told me a story about how Rin Tin Tin was kicked out of Dog Heaven because he got in a fight with a jaywalking cocker spaniel. It was a really interesting story, but he had to cut our meeting short, because a new arrival had to be met by Foofur. I thanked him and left, but just before I got on the bus home, my tour guide asked me if I, an omniscient human, knew what the meaning of life was. I told him it was to shut up, and he looked like he believed it. Some dogs are just stupid mutts. Oh well. I feel that I took away a renewed sense of respect for dogs, but that guide was just so stupid! He probably hasn’t said a word since then! Am I good, or what? Oh, well. This has been Larry King reporting.   The News: October 2, 2011–The Entertainment Section It is my pleasure to announce a contest. Write an essay between 300-1100 words about why Ronald McLayzer, the most paranoid person in the world, should fry in the electric chair. The winner will receive an autographed copy of the Bible! Now for the news. A PBS miniseries,”Tastes Like Chicken”, the true story of the man who was trapped in a morgue for six months, will replace Barney and Friends. Barney was taken off the air when the song sang on the show, “Rock-a-bye baby”, about a baby falling out of a tree, was deemed inappropriate for television. The first issue of Nite-Lite Assassin, the comic book about the gritty adventures of a ninja who is afraid of the dark, hits the stands next week. It comes from Demented Press. Magic: The Gathering, the collectible trading card game series, sees its 57th upgrade set this month, entitled “We Need a Dramatic Name”. This coincides with Heinz’s buying of the rights to the game. Ever wonder why Richie Rich &amp; Casper the Friendly Ghost look so similar? In “The Bloody Torturous Murder of Richie Rich”, airing tomorrow on the Disney Channel. It’s rated PG for extreme violence, nudity, rape, language, and badmouthing the government. That last one is why it’s so controversial. Some think it should be rated PG-13 for non-patriotism. Well, anyway, I think it’d be mean to let your kids miss seeing Richie Rich doomed to an eternity of wandering the earth in spirit form and given a stupid name like Casper. Police blew up an Ant Nudist Colony for breaking the Constant Clothing Act, which prohibited nudity. Remember the good old days when we used to be able to shower? Oh, well. I guess we’ll just have to stick to deodorant.  ← Badmouthing the government! Shame on you! -Editor This has been Apple Juice Simpson reporting. "

    "title": "Writings from Middle School (1993-1995) (Part Three)",
    "body": "School Daze (Feb 27, 1995) Kindergarten: Ah, yes. Kindergarten. I remember it well. My teacher was Mrs. Slattery, who lived (and still does live) so close to my house that I would walk there to borrow books. I actually liked school during these innocent times (It was 1986- I was 5. Wow! It’s hard to believe that we’re already halfway through the ’90s- it’s incredible!) I remember the first day of school. Other kids were screaming and crying for mommy, and I was coloring pictures of Smurfs and trying to convince my mom that I wasn’t going to (how can I put this in a nice way? I guess I can’t) miss her. I really regret now that I enjoyed school back then, because to this day I have relatives who think I still like school nine years later. I was good enough at the three R’s to like school, though. In fact, I remember the first problem I ever got wrong on a paper. I kept insisting that someone messed up my paper, because I understood it well enough. I could read perfectly, and I went to a first grade reading class, but I still couldn’t tie my shoes. I was still perfect, of course, and I never misbehaved. Honestly! Ask Mrs. Slattery! First grade: I remember 1st grade well, too. I went to a 2nd grade reading class and was still a whiz at anything &amp; everything. My teacher was Mrs. Gravelin, and we had a student teacher, too, though I forget her name. I know she was in charge of the coolest thing about this year, though- the mailbox. We could write letters to classmates, drop it in the mailbox, and the letters would be delivered by a volunteer from the class or something. I remember something really interesting, too. There was some girl in the class, and I don’t remember much about her, except I think she was chubby, and… I don’t know, but she started sending love letters to me. Now, I’ve heard that girls mature faster than boys, but at 6 years old, girls were just people who weren’t boys to me. She would send me a letter shaped in the form of a heart, and I would try to make one in the shape of a mouth and tongue. (That was one of my first real sarcastic doings- many would follow) I think I learned to tie my shoes this year, but not until later in the year. Grade two: I continued my education in Bowie School (I’d been going there since Kindergarten) in Mrs. (?)’s room. I don’t remember much that’s specific to second grade, so I’ll tell you a story from a year I can’t remember at Bowie. I think it was 3rd grade, but it might have been 2nd or 4th- I don’t know, but there was a contest to see who could get the closest guess to the number of jellybeans in a jar in the cafeteria. I got the number EXACTLY RIGHT, and I think it was a thousand and something. I wound up getting only about fifty, though, because my teacher made me share them with the entire class. I would have anyway, but I would have kept a little more for myself. I was the one who won it, RIGHT? Am I right or am I right? Third grade: As I write this, I remember more and more little details. For instance, in first grade I met a lot of my lasting friends. Plus I met Danny. In second grade, I went to a third grade reading class- in the same room as everyone else. For once, I was normal! (Not that I cared- things were much simpler back then. Teasing was kept at a reasonable level. ) My teacher this year was Mrs. (?), and I don’t remember that much about her. I do, however, remember going to a special Speech class either this year or in 2nd grade. (I guess I wasn’t that normal. ) (So what else is new?) I didn’t want to go, though. I put up a fit, but finally gave in. I learned to stop getting my r’s and w’s messed up, and everyone was happy. Also this year was a talent show that was held in our class. I remember that my friend Brian and I used some little toy tricks from a little magic set I had. It kind of was an easy act to follow, if you follow. I couldn’t sing or tap dance, so it was the best thing I could do. Oh well. Fourth grade: Oh boy. Miss O’Leary’s class. This thing might drag on for another eight pages. Miss O’Leary was one of the most… unique teachers I’ve had, right up there with Mr. Bailey and Mrs. Redfern, the Ballamy weirdos. Here in Bowie, though, this teacher was one who really should have gotten married and had some kids, because she always wanted hugs from her students. Really. I don’t know. She was kind of… well, either really lazy or really suffering from arthritis, because if she dropped a pen or something, she would always have someone from the front row run to pick it up. My desk was still insanely messy, like it had always been (you can’t even begin to imagine it). I think this year… yeah. I would always hang around with Brian (see third grade), and Danny, who I had always been friends with, would hang around us. We’d pick on him sometimes, though. There’s one thing I’m sorry to say abut Danny (not really- I like giving teachers dirt on Danny)- he didn’t know when to leave us alone. He was cool sometimes, and I would talk to him, blah blah, etc. etc. , but he can be really ANNOYING when he wants to be. Not that I’m not the same way, but I don’t bug myself, so I don’t care. Oh boy. Memories strike me again. Danny and I combined our writing skills (I think it was this year) to write a story called “The Terrible Termite That Leveled Vermont”. The reason the termite didn’t total Texas was that Danny figured that a termite would probably ravage a wooded area rather than the Alamo. (Ah, memories… I remember the Alamo. ) Fifth grade: This wasn’t a very important year, but it set up a lot of the chain reaction that would knock down the dominoes of my future that I had been setting up for so many years. (Cool analogy!) I found out that the world wasn’t 100% peachy keen, but my imagination and creativity still governed over a large part of my life. Nah, I won’t even get into the way my entire life was like a book or video game. I was immature, but a genius. Oh yeah! I forgot something about forth grade. I was the only kid from Bowie school to go to REACH class, but I got sick of going to an entirely different school one day a week at lunch, so I quit. In fifth grade I went to it, though, because it was in the school (which was Selser now), and most of my friends were in it. Oh yeah! I almost forgot! For the first time since 1st grade, Danny wasn’t in my class. My teacher was Mrs. Wells. Sixth grade: Still in Selser, this was a pretty important year, setting up the earthshaking events of seventh grade. I started to do a really weird, strange, sick and demented (well, kind of) comic called “My World”. It really expressed my creativity, and got me lots of attention, because they were funny. I also became more aware of the world and its dangers. I don’t know how to put this, really. I guess I grew up, mostly. The wonder, the fantasy world? That’s what disappeared. It helped me understand things better. Cool. I never really looked at sixth grade in that way before. My teacher was (?), but we switched for reading and math classes. Prepare yourself… here comes… Seventh grade: Okay. Don’t even try to understand this year, because even I can’t. It’s hard for me to try to find excuses for this year, but… well, suffice it to say, my grades dropped. It’s, like, I wasn’t used to getting questions about little unimportant things, so I had to study. The first half of the year, I didn’t know that I had to. I couldn’t get it through my thick skull. I wasn’t doing a lot of my homework, because I wasn’t used to having to keep track in my HWNB, and I would always forget what I had. I was kicked out of REACH for this reason, despite the high quality of what work I did turn in. The second half was weird. Mrs. Sittard, my homeroom and science teacher, saw how little effort I had been putting into things and decided that she didn’t like me. So I didn’t like her. One day, a report was due and I was out sick on the day it was due. When I came back on the following school day, she didn’t let me turn in the report and I got a 0 for a double test grade. There went my grade for that term. Okay. Now that I’ve cleared that up, what did I hear about Bellamy? Well, I heard mostly the truth, though a little watered down, because a couple of my aunts went to school here. It was in times a bit less… um… apocalyptic (sarcasm), but I got basically true information. Oh, yeah. I don’t know if you had her, but Cheryl Fortin used to skip school sometimes. (She’s been an aunt since she was born- I have a weird family. ) Back on the subject of Mrs. Sittard… nah, I’ll let the prosecution rest. Eighth grade: Yay! This thingie is almost finished, I’ve been writing for an hour and a half, and I still don’t have writer’s cramp! After 1994, the worst year of my life, 8th grade, particularly ‘95, is a breath of fresh air. Except for Mr. Layzer, I don’t have a real problem with any classes. Even though Mr. Warchol’s class is difficult, his nonlinear conversational form of teaching through thought rather than memorization is cool. I don’t know why he tries to be funny, though. Mrs. Safari with a k actually appreciates my style of writing, which is a lot more than I can say for any of my other old teachers. A bit too peppy at 8:45 in the morning, but not a bad teacher at all. Mr. Layzer… he’s stupid, his room’s cold, he gives us tests on things we didn’t do… Sorry, I don’t like him. I don’t much have any sort of opinion either way on Mrs. Gilbert- she’s a teacher, not really good, not really bad. I’d say basically the same for Mrs. Hoffner, with the bad outweighing the good just a wee bit. That’s it! This long, epic, “War and Peace”-type thing is finished! At least, it is for now! I’ve still got four years to live through in High School! C ya!   Smashy the Alcoholic Squirrel (Mar 3, 1995) There once was a squirrel named Smashy. He went to Oxfurred University and was a member of the Omega Alfalfa Bullemia fraternity. Smashy lived the life of any collegiate bachelor mammal- he partied, pulled all-nighters to study for tests, and got drunk a lot. There was a problem inside of Smashy, though- one not as easy to see as zits or head lice. You see, Smashy drank a bit more than his fellow frat members. Actually, he drank a lot more. If his friends wanted to relax and have some alcohol, he would relax and have some isopropyl alcohol. In fact, his blood-alcohol level was consistently higher than his I. Q. One day, all of that would change. As he walked the campus with his fellow squirrel, Rocky, an interesting thing happened. “No way,” Smashy said in a slurred voice, “You could not have been on a show with a moose! I’ve only met one person in my life that like moose, and he was a science teacher!” “But Smashy,” said Rocky in an annoying high-pitched voice, “I was too on a show! It was with Bullwinkle!” “No way,” said Smashy, “A bull named moose… I mean, a moose named bull? You must be drunk!” “Me–?!” Rocky started to object. “Look, Rocky!” exclaimed Smashy, “It’s a bed of tall roses!” “Those aren’t–!” “SILENCE!” he yelled, “Or you’ll be banished from Miss Americana!” He ran towards what he thought was a bed of roses and prepared to jump at them. “Smashy!” yelled Rocky, “Those aren’t roses, they’re–” Smashy landed on the “flowers” and screamed. ”–barbed wire fences!” finished Rocky. Smashy the squirrel went on to have 17 stitches on the butt. He was then shot and killed by Elmer J. Fudd, a giant-sized serial killer, less than an hour after his release from the hospital. E. J. ’s trial was watched by millions, and his lawyers made millions. He came out with a book, “I Want Twoo Twell Woo,” with sold millions. Judge Dancing Frito made his decision 5 years later- a mistrial. (Sigh…) AND NOW FOR A MORAL REEF- The moral is: Every rose has its thorn. Or: Ouch! My butt!   How Fish Can Astral Project If you’re a fish, you, too, can astral project your spirit in the comfort of your own home. Whether you’re a salmon, trout, or bass, this will work for you. First, you must find a hook with a worm on it. These can often be found within 75-100 feet off the coasts, though where they come from is one of the great mysteries that have plagued fishkind. You must slit yourself a new gill with the hook, to allow your spirit to escape. Then, while the wound is fresh, and blood is gushing out, relax and hum showtunes. Next, you must float to the surface, play dead for ten seconds, and then swim down into the water at top speed until you slam into a coral reef. Your soul will then escape your body. The only problem with this is that you can’t go back into your body, because it’s dead. Now your spirit form is free to wander the earth as a lost soul for all of eternity. Good luck, live long and prosper!   Dave the Deadly Dinosaur’s Disastrous Decision Dave the Deadly Dinosaur’s dangerous day job, film developing, did disasterous defective deterrants to his dirty Deville’s detailing. Dave ‘s dumb decision to develop on his Deville destroyed the delightful details of it. Despite developing’s delightful benefits, Dave decided to become a documentary director. Dave’s Dad had directed diligently for decades, but Dave definitely didn’t deserve a directing job. Dave’s Dad decided to direct Dave directly in a directing direction. Dave did a disasterous job directing. The first documentary Dave did, on dodos, was destroyed by Dave’s developing stuff. Dave’s Dad delightfully destroyed Dave’s directing permit, then disowned Dave. Moral: Don’t do something you can’t do well.   Sentences: What They Don’t Tell You about the St. Patrick’s Day Parade (Mar 20, 1995) Last Sunday, the St. Patrick’s Day parade marched through Holyoke without any problems, pleasing spectators both Irish and sober. (It’s a harmless joke. I’ve got some Irish in me, but I couldn’t resist. ) At least, everyone thought it went well. But I know different, because just before the parade started, I felt the call of the wild, and needed to look for the bathroom. I guess I went too far, because I was soon far away from the parade and $25 balloon swindlers. When I saw a big building with a bunch of cars in front of it, though, I figured I’d reached the bathroom. I walked in to see all the parade floats that didn’t make the parade. All of them, from Blarney the Dinosaur to the float with live, poisonous snakes all over it, which would have been released into the crowd at the end of the parade route. Then I saw the man who had been my elementary school principal for five years, Mr. Burgess, in the act of committing a felony–arson! I had heard that he was corrupt, but I still couldn’t believe my eyes! “Hey!” I yelled, “Drop that lighter fluid!” I pulled out my gun and pointed it at him. He dropped the can and kicked it over tome. I picked it up, and while I was ducking down, he lit a match and threw it on the float that was covered with lighter fluid. Then he started to run. Not that he got far. The police came in and yelled at me to drop the gun and lighter fluid and put my hands in my pockets. I did, and Mr. Burgess did nothing but wrongly incriminate me! When I told the cops that he was the real culprit, they didn’t believe me. They punched me in the gut, threw me to the ground and kicked me until their legs got tired, which took about 20 seconds. Since Mr. Burgess was the adult, they asked him for ID. When he opened his wallet, one cop saw the money in it, and being a money expert, was able to see that it was counterfeit. Knowing he was in trouble, Mr. Burgess hijacked one of the floats and took off down the street. By then, the parade had started, so he just plowed through a bunch of innocent bystanders. Then he hit Mr. Layzer’s pet moose, was thrown out the window and right onto Antley’s antlers. He died of starvation two hours ago. I was acquitted, but I feel sorry for Mr. Burgess. He never felt repentant at all. I’m the only one who remembers this story, though. The police had some aliens (not the gray ones– they’re not nice) erase the memories from anyone who was there. I wasn’t affected, because I’m a human/alien hybrid.   The Most Dysfunctional Family in the World: Meet the Spites Meet the Spites. They’re the most dysfunctional family in the world, according to the Guiness Book of Dysfunctional Records. I set up camera in their house to record their behavior. At 11:30 in the morning, Mirgo, the mother, woke up. She screamed, “FIRE!” to wake up the rest of the family. Joe Neatbark, the father (the family got their last name from the dog, Rainbow Spite) took the baseball bat from behind his bed and ran into the living room. When he saw Mirgo standing there and smiling, he swung the bat at her. She ducked and punched him… and it hurt him. Then Testosterone, the son, came downstairs with a cigarette in his hand. He wore a dress with Daffy Duck embroidered on it. “I JUST GOT TO SLEEP!” he screamed at the top of his lungs, “WHY THE &amp;%$# DID YOU WAKE ME UP?!” “TESTOSTERONE!” yelled the father, “IF I’VE TOLD YOU ONCE, I’VE TOLD YOU TWICE! NO SMOKING UNTIL YOU’RE EIGHT!” “Dad,” he said, “It’s not a cigarette, IT’S A JOINT IN DISGUISE!” Mirgo, still afraid of Joe’s baseball bat, pulled out the chainsaw from underneath the couch cushion and chopped the bat in half. “Mirgo, you &amp;$#@!” yelled Joe, “I OUGHTTA BRING YOU BACK TO THE GUTTER WHERE I FOUND YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND!” “Why don’t you just skin me alive and make me into a rug, like you did with my last husband?” “I DON’T WANT YOUR FAT ALL OVER THE PLACE!” he screamed. “SHUT UP!!!!” yelled Testosterone. Then everyone shut up and went back to sleep. Little did they know that Nick Bernier was outside, with their sheep.   You Won’t Believe What Happened To Me YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. Hmm. Okay. I was sitting in Mrs. Gilbert’s 8th grade Reading class. It was 12:40 P. M. on April 25, 1995. Writing a short story was usually no problem for me. In fact, I wrote all the time. But this time, something was different. I had no ideas. None at all. So I began to write. “YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,” I wrote. “Hmm. Okay. ” I was about to write about something, but I had forgotten. Okay, I figured, I’d write my thoughts. “YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,” I wrote. “Hmm. Okay. ” Now I was going to write about “YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,” I wrote. Suddenly I was feeling strange. “Hmm. Okay,” I wrote. “YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,” I wrote. “What are you writing?” asked a voice in front of me. That’s when I realized it. Something was wrong, and it wasn’t just deja vu. I was in Mr. Warchol’s class. “What are you doing? Reading homework? Why aren’t you “YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,” I wrote. “Hmm. Okay,” I wrote. I walked into Mrs. Gilbert’s 8th grade reading class. It was 12:27 P. M. on April 25, 1995. Nick Bernier was in front of me. I closed the door behind me and sat down at my desk. “YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,” I wrote, “Hmm. Okay. ” Now I knew what to write. “I was sitting in Mrs. Gilbert’s 8th grade Reading class. It was 12:40 P. M. on April 25, 1995. ” But it wasn’t. “But it wasn’t,” I wrote. It was 12:54 P. M. on April 25, 1995. On my paper was some sort of weird story about… something weird. So I decided to go with the flow. “YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,” I wrote. “I Wrote,” I wrote. “I wrote,” I wrote. “I wrote,” I wrote. “I wrote,” I wrote.   The Invasion It all began as an object falls through the Earth’s atmosphere. It lands before construction worker Big Harold. He saw that it was alive… and unlike anything he had ever seen before. He tried to help the thing reassemble itself, but little did he know what was behind him. The blob tried to warn him, but it was too late. Big Harold was the first victim of the Alien Temple on Wheels. The alien, though, whose name was Zeeblex, was able to jump out of the temple’s path before he could be squished again. Meanwhile, 200 yards away, an angry California Raisin was complaining about how his 15 minutes of fame were over and he was now living in the streets. He was the next victim. As the temple on wheels continued its gravity-aided rampage, Dr. E. Ville Chick was scheming to obtain the 0-(.  She sent out the Martian Happy Car, which she had gotten on an expedition to Mars. It looked nice on the outside, with a fake human head in it, but it was actually the greatest weapon on wheels. Its quest was to apprehend the Alien Paper Clip, the only thing that could pick the lock of the Alien Temple on Wheels, which was where the 0-( was. Coincidentally, the Temple, unthining as it was, was also headed towards the Alien Paper Clip, which was torturing Mr. Pincushion Rear by jamming the pins deeper into his rear. Meanwhile, Sad Sal, blessed (or cursed, depending on how you look at it) with the mutant power of knowing everything, saw what was happening inside of his girlfriend and cried. The only sperm cells of his that had a chance of becoming a baby had become rebellious and quit. He would never be a father now. Then he turned his attention to the events happening involving the alien stuff, and cried some more. Just then, Zeeblex had caught up to the Temple and jumped on top of it. He had come to Earth to stop it, but he was having fun riding it. He didn’t care when it ran over Mr. Pincushion Rear and the Alien Paper Clip. He just continued to ride the Temple. When the Martian Happy Car arrived at the scene of the crime, the Paper Clip was flattened, but not destroyed. That meant it could still be used. The Happy Car picked up the Paper Clip and sped off after the Alien Temple on Wheels. It caught up with it easily, and blew it up. The Dr. E. Ville Chick couldn’t believe what she had seen over her viewscreen. It had been programmed to get the 0-(! What was its problem? Fortunately for her, the Temple was still intact. She would just have to get the 0-( by herself. Using her teleportation powers, she appeared in front of the Happy Car and swiped the Paper Clip. She then appeared in front of the Temple and opened it with the Clip. It grew to the Dr. ’s size, and let her inside, where she found the 0-(. She grabbed it and used it to take over the world. She ruled it for 1,000 years, until two rebellious sperm cells overthrew her.   Sentences (May 23, 1995)    I will enumerate all of the times I have ever blinked.     The keynote star at the science fiction convention was Leonard Nimoy.     The lecturer, Mr. Warchol, yelled about how we were diabolical, manipulative children.     Forrest Gump had a bit more than just a lisp.     I gave an oration to the SSSC (the Society of Senile Senior Citizens).     I made a proclamation that legalized prostitution for all amphibians.     I fell off the pulpit and into Quentin Tarentino, director of “Pulp Fiction”.     She quaked and shook, so I smacked her. (Teacher’s comment: “Good”)     I was reticent in public, but when I was alone, I was very outgoing and talkative.     I wish I could stammer, but I just can’t seem to be able to.    The Obese Snake and the Gangsta Gerbil Once upon a time there was an obese snake and a gangsta gerbil. The snake often enjoyed eating smaller beings to satisfy its inhuman hunger. The gerbil, on the other hand, kept mostly to himself and his boyz, but if someone stepped to him, that motha would be gettin’ a beat down. One day, the gangsta gerbil came across the obese snake as he slithered across his turf. “Yo, wassup? You better be gettin’ off my turf,” said the gangsta gerbil. So the snake ate him and continued along his merry little way. But suddenly, the snake felt a slashing from his insides. He began to scream in agony as the gerbil cut his way out of the snake’s stomach with a concealed switchblade he had hidden in his pocket. As the obese snake bled to death on the cold pavement, the gangsta gerbil went home to take a shower. -THE END- The moral of the story is: You best not mess with a gangsta gerbil. "

Today’s guest has asked us to keep his identity secret, out of fear that the HUMANS who tried to brutally beat him to death might attempt this atrocity once again. Ladies and gentlemen, please, let’s see a warm round of applause for Mr. Piña Colada Piñata… I mean, our unnamed guest. Let’s call him Bob. ” CLAPCLAPCLAPCLAPCLAPCLAPCLAP! (Elevator music version of “Smells Like Teen Spirit”) “Thanks for being on the show today, Piña… I mean, Bob. ” “Uh… thanks. It’s good to be here. ” “Let’s begin at the beginning, shall we? You were living comfortably in the Andersons’ attic with your wife of… how many years?” “Seven years. ” “SEVEN YEARS. And, now, you had never in any way done anything to this family of HUMANS that would persuade them to try this?” “No. Never. ” “Now, tell us what happened the night your wife was taken away. ” “Well, we had been… well, just sitting around…” “Something that all of us inanimate objects should take pride in doing. ” “Right. And then, all of a sudden, we heard a creaking…” “And it was one of the HUMANS?” “Yes, it was… the daughter. Sandy Anderson. ” “How old was this girl?” “I’m not sure… She couldn’t be any older than six, maybe seven. ” “A SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL?” “Yes. ” “Wow. ” “And she came up to my wife, with this large, looming, gratuitous grin on her face. ‘There you are,’ she said to her, ‘I’m going to LOVE beating you up and seeing ALLL the candy so’s I can eat. ’ I’ll never forget those words. ” “Unbelievable. And neither of you could do anything?” “Not a thing. We’re inanimate. ” “Wow. ” “And then she picked up my wife, beat her upside the head a couple times, and then… &lt;SOB&gt;… carried her off!” “May those evil HUMANS rot in Hell for that. ” “&lt;SOB&gt;” “Now, now, Piña… I mean, Bob.

Phil’s parents had been drug addicts, and his mother hadn’t let a little thing like pregnancy stop her from indulging in several damaging illegal substances. Thanks to this bit of genius, Phil was born without a closure at the top of his mouth- definitely not fun come flu season. Throughout his life, Phil had been greeted by relentless teasing from his peers- decidedly not the model lifestyle for a young American. To deal with this everyday life (or, more precisely, to not deal with it), Phil himself started experimenting with drugs. And when I say experimenting, I mean experimenting. He started off small. Inhaling glue, for instance. A very pathetic, yet inexpensive way to “have some fun”, Phil was first in line to try it. Little did he know what trouble lay in store for him. The first time he tried it was during the afternoon, behind his high school. Phil unscrewed the cap, unscrewed it some more, unscrewed it some more, and then finally figured “screw this unscrewing” and pulled at it as hard as he could until it came off. He held it up to his nose and prepared to inhale it. Then the janitor opened the door behind him. WHAM! The janitor had been inside of the school- he had no way of knowing what was going on outside of the door. When he opened the door at full force, it sent Phil flying towards the ground, and sent the bottle of glue up his economy-sized nasal cavity. Then Phil did something that he would live to regret- he rolled over, draining most of the Elmer’s Glue into the gaping hole inside of his head. As soon as he realized he was doing his, he yanked out the bottle, but by then the damage was done. He frantically started spitting and digging out the glue as fast as humanly possible, but he still couldn’t get all of the glue out before it started to harden. So he started scraping off the glue layers and pulling at them, trying to get the glue out. The janitor couldn’t do anything to help- he was too busy chastising the youngster for doing something as stupid as inhaling glue. Phil tugged and tugged at the glue, pulling out layer after layer. It was the sickest thing that has ever happened in the history of mankind. Finally, Phil was able to get a grasp on one good strand. He tugged on it and tugged on it until- SHLLLLLLLURP! Out came his brain. Ewwwwwwww. There was now a new sickest thing that ever happened in the entire history of mankind. “Aaiieeeeeeeee!” screamed the janitor in a voice one might otherwise think impossible coming from someone of the masculine persuasion. Phil’s eyes widened and widened, and suddenly he bears an uncanny resemblance to Speed Racer. “Mr. janitor person guy sir mop person again minimum wage scum of the earth man? Is it just me, or is there a… brain hanging out of my nose? Mr. janitor person guy sir mop person again minimum wage scum of the earth man? …. . Oh, crap. ” So Phil picked himself up, brushed off some of the dirt that he’d collected while rolling around on the ground spastically and picking glue out of his nose, and started to walk home. With a brain hanging out of his mouth.   Untitled (Nov. 17, 1995) As soon as Bill Jr. saw what was written on the piece of paper, he began to feel himself get pulled apart at the very center of his being. He felt a sensation of lightness, almost a freedom in the sense that he was no longer restrained to his human form. Unfortunately for him, however, this didn’t last long. As quickly as this transformation of self had begun, it ended. Only he was no longer the Bill Jr. he was used to being, and he was no longer in the village that he was used to being in. Where was he? Why was he here? He stared blankly for a brief moment as he took in the significance of what had happened to him. What was this yard that he was in? Why was he under a tree? He noticed a small rabbit as it screamed vulgarities at its watch. He watched it as it was shot dead by a large-headed man who seemed to have a strange problem with pronouncing the letter “r”. He smiled as his shotgun smoked: “Now I got woo, woo wascully wabbit!” “NO!” screamed Bill Jr. at the top of his lungs. The strange bald man immediately turned his attention to the young boy. “Pwepeah to die!” He took aim and prepared to fire. His survival instincts now kicking in, Bill Jr. leaped towards the rabbit’s motionless body. This is when he noticed a small hole in the ground. It was large enough for him to fit himself inside, he figured. So he delved into the enigmatic chasm, smiling freakishly. Darkness. All that Bill Jr. could see was darkness. Further and further and further he fell. Wow, he thought to himself, This is a pretty deep hole. He suddenly thought that this whole situation, strangely enough, reminded him of a story that his mother had told him—a really sadistic version of “Jack and the Beanstalk”. He tried to remember what had happened at the end of that story. Oooo…he strained himself to try to figure it out. Oh yeah! He finally remembered! The boy died! And just as he thought of that, he hit the ground, became a small, slimy, red-colored goo. In case you’re wondering exactly what that means, he died. The end.   …And He Left a Trail of Breadcrumbs (Unfinished) CHAPTER ONE It takes all the strength that I have just to keep a straight face as she walks by. Not a muscle twitch can be seen, not a missed breath can be noticable. Everything needs to be…perfect. She doesn’t turn her head, doesn’t acknowledge my existence, just walks on to her destination with that walk. That stride. The coordination that she shows…. I can see it in my mind, even as I blink to ignore what I want to see. Instead I look at my locker. My combination. I concentrate on that, but still I wish…. . I wish…. . 29…42…1. I slip the bag off of my shoulders. It catches the sleeve of my way-too-small sweatshirt, forcing me to completely restructure my balance… Finally the bag’s on the floor, but the noise of its landing has forced the guy five lockers down from me to look up from his business. I give him a look that to me is menacing, but that, judging by the effect it’s had on people in the past, isn’t quite as convincing as it seems to be when I practice it in front of the mirror. Unlike many I’ve confronted in the course of my schooling, this guy isn’t about to look away as long as I look at him. But, stubborn as I am, I don’t give. I continue to stare at him, and our eyes lock. Contact. I’m ready to say something, until it hits me. “Hey!” is all I can come up with in the half-second it takes for yet another stranger to slam me into my locker door, not even pausing before continuing his sprint down the already congested hallway. I feel my eyes water, not because of a lack of a lack of emotional control, but because of the sudden collision. I hate it. I don’t dare to wipe away the tears, that would draw attention to them. Instead, I just pray that they’ll dry up before I get to my biology class. I reach into my locker and pull out my algebra book. Looking down, I realize that I haven’t opened my bag yet. Wonderful. I place my book down on top of my bag, knowing full well that it’ll slip off as I unzip it. I open up the bag and place the book inside, then repeat the procedure with my spanish and biology books. Then I get the feeling that I’m being watched. My first instinct is to turn around and look in the direction of the guy who had been staring at me, but now he’s just turned to walk away. I quickly turn around, and I see a girl. She looks familiar, but I can’t attach the face to a name. When she sees me turned around and looking at her, she lowers her head, slips her bag over her shoulder and begins to walk away with that…that…fluidity. The fluidity that so many people have and use without giving a second thought, but that I DON’T have. I zip up my own bag and place it on my shoulder. She had been looking at me, I knew that. She hadn’t been particularly attractive…. in fact, she hadn’t been at all attractive, she’d been actually kind of putrid…. . …well… Except maybe her eyes. There had been something in there, hadn’t there? Yeah. Yeah, there had been. It was something special. Something intelligent, something sweet, something… I make a face as I’m crushed between some massive guy who doesn’t look a day older than 40 and some petite little freshman girl. I hate these crowded hallways. I’m almost to my class now, and I think about what had happened. What would a girl ever see in me, anyway? Everybody’s got to have some sort of standards, and I figure I’m just barely a couple of notches from rock bottom, at least as far as attractiveness goes. Just before I reach my biology class, I notice Preston walking by. He doesn’t notice me, but he certainly would be able to hear me if I said something to him. He’s close enough, there’s no doubt about it. And he’s a pretty nice guy, so he’d probably answer back…. Nah, I say to myself. I just forget it and go into my room- he probably had better things to worry about. He doesn’t need me bugging him when he’s obviously going to be late for class. I turn the corner and walk into class, and in front of the room, instead of the teacher, is…. . (yay!) a substitute. I smile a bit as I begin to walk towards my seat… then I see the girl again. The one who had been looking at me in the hallway- she was sitting in the seat behind mine, apparently because of the prescence of the sub. I didn’t know she was in this class! As seems to always be the case when I’m confronted with something of the opposite gender, I feel my head slowly begin its descent downward… I walk to my seat. I stare at the seat, ignoring her completely, pretending I don’t see her. “AMANDA + CRAIG 4-EVER” is engraved on it in expertly crafted skill. I’m amazed that someone could ever craft that well just sitting down, much less during class. I let the bag down and step over it as I slide into my seat. “SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!” I let out a sigh. I have to deal with the squeaky desk again. I try to fix myself into a comfortable position so that I don’t have to adjust myself and bother the rest of the kids. SQUEEEK! SQUEEEEEEEEEEK! “Stephen?” It’s not the girl behind me— it’s her. It’s Jeanette. I look up from my desk, and for once I feel like I did it right. That must’ve looked pretty cool…or at least pretty decent. “Yeah?” I say, as nonchalantly as I can manage, as I look up at her. “Um…. . do you think you could move up a seat? I want to sit next to Sandra. ” “Oh! Yeah! Yeah, sure. No prob. Just hold on a second,” I say as I pick up my bag, put it on the desk, then squeeze myself out and pick it up again to move. I can’t believe it. I’ve only been this close to her a couple of times before, and those times had only been brief. I feel something, I definitely feel something different. I pull out my book and notebook. The feeling is overwhelming, like something’s flowing into me. It’s…wonderful. It almost makes me forget about the other girl- Sandra. Almost. As the bell rings, I open my book and try to act like I’m focused on the front of the room. But, of course, I’m not. I’m futily trying to hear the conversation between Jeanette and Sandra. They’re whispering to each other. And the feeling keeps flowing. I sit there, trying to look as if I’m immersed in deep thought, while I’m actually just sitting there, feeling weird. Weird, yet good. Happy. When was the last time I was actually happy, I ask myself. Ummm…… I squint a little. Something’s wrong…. different. I feel like I’m…bloated. My stomach is aching like nothing I’ve ever felt before, I have an Excedrin headache the size of Montana, and I’m finding it hard to stay in my chair. Slowly but surely, I begin to lose my resistance, and I start getting out of my chair. I’m so preoccupied, I don’t even notice the thump that comes from behind me. I’m not aware of what’s happened until I hear the gasping of my classmates. I spin around, ignoring the pressure now. I look in the direction of Jeanette’s chair, but instead of seeing her sitting down in it, I see her on the floor. She’s laying face-first, seemingly motionless. The pain I had been feeling before was nothing compared to what I’m feeling now- my heart…. . it feels as if it’s literally sunk into a lower position in my chest. For a second I just stare, much like the others. Then I realize that have to do something. I push off of my chair slightly. I lean forward to get down on my knees, but I suddenly lose my balance unexplainably- it’s as if gravity has shifted gears for a minute. I, too, collapse, but I’m able to pick myself up…albeit painfully. “WHAT DID YOU DO?!” screams Sandra. I look up at her, my face displaying my ignorance. Without saying any words, she leaps out of her chair and bolts out of the classroom, going who-knows-where. The look that had been on her face wasn’t fearful, that was for sure. It had been more like a determination, like she’d left to go accomplish something. Meanwhile, I’m left hunched over Jeanette, feeling as if I weigh 700 pounds. I feel so angry at myself- why now, when the love of- when Jeanette needs my help? Why do these things always happen to me? It’s one thing when my bad luck affects me, but when it hurts those around me…. . . . when it hurts… …it hurts…. . …oh, god…… ……. . Tweet, Tweet Good morning, world. It’s another beautiful morning. The sun has risen as scheduled, the rays of light are sneaking through my blinds. From the outside of the window I can hear the sound of birds chirping merrily. I force myself up into a sitting position and stretch out my arms as I yawn. For a moment I sit there, all the wonders of conscious thought lost to me, until the sound of the birds touches me once again. I stand up and walk over the window, not in any kind of hurry but not as slow as I might have if the situation were different. I reach the window, and I stand there for a second, staring into the single-colored black shade in front of it. What a lovely shade, I think to myself, it’s a shame that I have to put it up to reach the happy little birds. After making this statement to the voices in my head an hearing their unanimous agreement, I pull down on the shade softly. It goes down. But not up. I pull it again, this time a bit harder. It goes even further down. But not up. Finally I tear at it savagely and rip the shade in half. But the birds don’t scatter. Instead, they begin to walk closer to me… closer… closer. One of them flutters into the house effortlessly and lands on my shoulder. “Mr. Bluebird on my shoulder,” I say to it, inviting it into my hand. It lovingly follows, entrusting me with its life. “So small… so delicate… so beautiful…” It stares me in the face and chirps, as if it were trying to tell me something. What would a little bird say to me, I wonder? SPLAT! Hm… probably something along the lines of “ow”, after getting squished onto the desk and into a small pile of red, grey, and white mush. I smile and walk, now happy and rejuvenated, back to my bed. I can’t sleep anymore, so I just plop myself down, grab the remote and flip through the channels. I’m in such a great mood that I don’t even mind the sun that’s pouring through. Yessir, it’s going to be a great day, I think to myself. “Stuuuuuuuuuupendous! Let’s sing a song about it!” CLICK! “What Randy doesn’t know is that Ginger has a secret that she’s come on the show today to tell him. ” CLICK! “And it appears that in several seconds, the world will come to an end. Back to you, Margaret. ” “Thank you, Brian. In other news, O. J. Simpson will be going to trial for the murder of a praying mantis. After being found guilty last year for his prior double-murder conviction, but having the crime lowered to the level of a misdemeanor because of his celebrity status and serving seven days of community service, he was accused of this crime two weeks ago by his second-grade outdoor education teacher. ” Then I look out through the ripped shade. Hey, it’s a bright light. What did those old commercials from the ’60s always say? I try to remember. If you see a flash… um… buck and hover? No, no, that’s not it… suck an udder? Mmm, no… boy, I just can’t seem to remember what… THE END.   Outback Is anybody out there? Fractured echoes in my head The shallow people out there The only deep ones in my mind I know if I can trust them And I know just when I can’t Nobody believes me That they’re swimming in a cesspool In the shallow end? The deep ones understand For they’re not bound by the dumb rules Of such conformity Though normal is a relative term To the deep nothing is normal The trouble is the world outside The toast, it keeps on burning Hell, it is the world outside Challenge? Nothing to me Nothing here can ever hurt me Everything makes sense to me Too bad I know it cannot last The shallow end is waiting It needs my help to rot I’ll go there and I’ll do no good Why won’t it all continue?   MR. SKIT NARR: The year is 2032. A horrible plague of halitosis that affects only cows has devastated the country. Bovine immigration officials have attempted to bring in cows from foreign lands in a futile attempt to save the American Cow, but nothing has worked. As our story begins, not one cow has been sighted in over 18 months, and, although rumors of remaining cows persist, this wondrous species has been declared officially extinct. NARR: In the woods not far outside of Houston, Delaware, Moomoo MacDonald and his father, Old MacDonald, are shooting clay pigeons. Little do they know of the horrible tragedy that will be the result of their carelessness. MOOMOO: Okay, PULL! (Aims shotgun upward, waits… no response from Old) MOOMOO: I said… PULL! (Continues to wait) (He looks in back of him, and Old is asleep at the… um… clay dispenser- I don’t know what it’s called!) MOOMOO: Oh, COME ON! (Kicks Old in the gut) OLD: OW! Hey! What’d you do that for?! MOOMOO: ‘Cause you were asleep! OLD: So what if I was resting my eyes?! MOOMOO: RESTING YOUR EYES?! We’re not out here to REST OUR EYES, we’re out here to blow up some flying pieces of clay! Now shut up, dad, and just pull the stupid lever! OLD: (grumbles to himself)…. . fine. (Pulls the lever, clay pigeon {pencil in rubber band} goes flying out… Moomoo wasn’t ready yet) (Both their eyes follow the pigeon as it goes flying, then Moomoo turns back and glares at Old) MOOMOO: EXCUSE ME? OLD: What? MOOMOO: Why didn’t you wait for me? OLD: (getting angry now) Because you said to pull! (Cow enters on opposite side) MOOMOO: Yeah, but not THEN! MAN, just how big of an idiot ARE you? OLD: HEY, you’re lucky I even brought you on this trip, Moomoo! Don’t you start getting fresh with me! MOOMOO: Fresh, huh? I’ll show you fresh!

No matter what, I’m kicking butt, And no one seems to notice! Who cares if I’m only eight years old? Don’t undermine my talent. I’m really hot, Too bad you’re not. My code name’s Princess Valiant. What’s that you say? It’s time to die? But sir, I am your super spy! But now, you say, it’s time to go, this is the end of this? I can’t be trusted with the information that exists? I dug my grave because of dear old undercover Pris, Who I told on when I saw her and my older brother kiss? But sir, my name is Sarah. Please let me plead my case. Your Pris was not a superbrain, But merely a nutcase! But sir, even if you decide I simply have to die And that all I have told you Have been no more than lies, Then I don’t care, What’s fair is fair, Then let that be the case!

All because of that fateful night when I decided to jaywalk, and was sent to court in front of my ex-wife’s new husband. I was in a crowded cell with fifty other convicts who smelled terrible. I knew this wouldn’t last long, though. I knew that I had to break out. So, one night when the guard was asleep, I left. The door to the cell wasn’t even locked. As I walked down the street in clothes straight from the garbage, I noticed a scratch ticket on the ground. It wasn’t even touched. I picked it up, scratched it, and found out I had won $9,999. 99. I brought it to the nearest newstand and got the cash. Six hours later, I was in the arcade playing Mortal Kombat 3. I had already spent seventy-five dollars on it. Then I beat a big guy with a gun under his hat. He grabbed me by the colar. The next thing I remember is lying in a gutter with a note on my head. It said, I’m sorry you passed out when I gave you that hug. Here’s the number to the jail. Bail me out, please.  -Harry I ignored the note and went to a fancy Chinese restaurant. I ordered the cream of Sum Yung Guy. After being kicked out, I headed to the movies to see “White Men Still Can’t Jump”. Then a flying pig with a horn impaled me. THE END "

    "body": "Part One: A STORY ABOUT BIG BIRD Gordon &amp; Maria directed Big Bird to the top of their apartment. “I don’t know, Gordon! What if I can’t fly?” “The ground’s soft!” answered Maria. Snuffy woke up from his nappy, and saw Big Bird at the top of the building, and came running to save him. But he failed. Big Bird jumped off the building, flapped his wings, and fell. He was just a splat of yellow on the sidewalk. Gordon and Maria laughed evily. “Ha ha ha ha! Finally we’re rid of that pathetic Big Bird! Now, Sesame Street will be ours!”   Part Two: A STORY ABOUT THE COOKIE MONSTER Everyone on Sesame Street attended the funeral of Big Bird. No one yet knew of Gordon &amp; Maria’s evil plan. They would slowly kill off all of Sesame Street, one by one, until no one would stand in their way. Next on their list was Cookie Monster. “Here, Cookie! Have a cookie!” said Maria, handing a cookie to Cookie Monster. While Cookie Monster was eating the cookie, though, Gordon told a great joke, and Cookie Monster choked. Grover saw all of this and gasped. He jumped out at the killers. “You killed Cookie!” yelled Grover. “He knows,” said Maria, “He must be the next to die. ”   Part Three: A STORY ABOUT GROVER “Me? Die? Uh… sorry. Got to go. ” Gordon and Maria ran after Grover with death on their minds. But he was too fast. “He got away,” said Gordon, “We’ve got to find and kill him. ” Eventually they did. He was hiding near Oscar’s trash can, with a microphone. “Help!” he yelled, “Gordon &amp; Maria are murderers!” That was all he could say before Gordon and Maria made him choke on a hairball from himself. “Soon everyone on Sesame Street will know about our plan!” exclaimed Gordon. “Then, we’ll just have to kill them all,” said Maria.   Part Four: A STORY ABOUT KERMIT Gordon and Maria stormed down Sesame Street until they reached a living roadblock- Kermit the Frog. “Gordon, is it true that you and Maria are killing off all of Sesame Street and taking over?” “On the count of 3…” “1…” “What are you…” “2…” “Counting for?” “3… GO!” Gordon and Maria picked up Kermit and threw him at Oscar’s trash can. Oscar emerged. “Yeah, what?”	“You’re gonna die!” answered Maria.   Part Five: A STORY ABOUT OSCAR THE GROUCH “Hey! What in the world’s going on?” asked Oscar, “A gun? What are you gonna do with that?” Gordon shot him. Then he grabbed Maria and ran into their apartment. “They’re onto us,” said Maria, “We’ll never make it! There’s too many of them!” “No… we’ll do it,” said Gordon, “I know it for one good reason. My secret weapon. ” “What?” “A solid hologram producer. ”   Part Six: A STORY ABOUT ELMO Elmo had learned about Gordon and Maria’s plans, and he wasn’t happy. So he got in his biker outfit, took out his gun, and became… “THE TERMINELMO!” He stormed into Gordon and Maria’s apartment and blew them away. Their evil plans were spoiled. But Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Kermit, Grover, and Oscar were still dead. Too bad. Elmo and the other residents of Sesame Street lived happily ever after. NOT. "

    "body": "Every day of every year I ask myself the inevitable question:WHY ME? Everything seems to happen to me. Such as the time when I found a futuristic television remote control. I found it on my way home from school. When I arrived at my house, “Quantum Leap” was on. I decided to use the remote right then &amp; there. I pressed a button. Suddenly, a bright, green light surrounded me. The next thing I knew, I was in a spaceship! QUANTUM LEAP! I was sitting next to a short, fat guy with a “KISS ME I’M NICE” shirt on. I looked at him. Then I looked at the portable television. It looked primitive compared to the advanced electronic equipment also on board. I aimed my remote at the television and pressed a different button. MACGYVER jumped out of the T. V. and knocked my partner unconscious, then went for me. I shoved him into the dehydration chamber. That’s why his show went off the air. Auto-pilot landed the ship on Planet Z, where, according to the ship’s computer, Sir Matthew had disappeared several years before. I stepped out of the ship and fell into a crater. I climbed out and stepped in quicksand. I used a whip I had and tried to grab onto the branch, but failed. I then continued to sink……. I landed in an underground chamber and saw Sir Matthew. I was soon warped back home. I threw the remote out that day. Maybe I had changed the future. Maybe…. . THE END…? "

    "body": "The cards were all after her, off with her head, She’d pissed off the queen, now she wanted her dead! Alice wants out, this place is too weird. Now she asks me about my ridiculous beard. So I explain to her, it’s because of this place That this hair is covering my beautiful face! And she tells me to forget about the caucus parade, And to worry instead about the mad deuce of spades! With long spear in hand, he’s running our way! Now I comment to her, this just isn’t my day. She says she agrees, but that it doesn’t matter. The only one on her side is Tom Petty, the Hatter! She now takes off running, grabbing me by the hand. She says he liked his tea, but now it’s been banned! We run and we run, she knows her direction. Soon we are there, the timing is perfection. Tom is out front, with cake in his hand, He says that he eats it, since tea has been banned. He says it’s his unbirthday, and he hopes it’s ours too. Alice says we can’t stay, ‘cause we have some bad news. So the Mad Hatter frowns, and he says his heart aches. He says he has no gown, but he has wedding cake! We look at each other, and then at the Hatter. I say wait for another, enough with this chatter! The cards are attacking, and we’re in their sights! There’s no time for snacking, ‘cause this really bites! He takes off his hat and pulls out an automatic. I can’t believe that he’s such a fanatic! Along comes a bunny, real big and real white. He looks kinda funny, as only a mother could like. Now, besides the fact that this thing is demented, He’s also obviously anal-retentive The Hatter sees him, and then he pulls the trigger. He says he was big, but that still he’s caught bigger. Alice, she screams at the top of her lungs. She says that was mean, and she really hates guns. Tom shrugs his shoulders and looks in the distance. Here come the soldiers, we need some resistance! I say we should run, but the Hatter ignores me. That’d be no fun, so he goes on a killing spree. Alice, she freaks, tries the fifty yard dash Behind are the creeps, the ace gives her a gash. I run to Alice, her face is now bleeding, An act of malice he plans on repeating. He says to me, Timmy, get out of the way, Why can’t you see that the heretic must pay? I say my name’s Adam, and there’s no way I’m budging She’s up and she’s at ‘em…OUCH! That must hurt like nothing. Alice hit him hard, and now he’s out cold, It looks like the card, he decided to fold. That got my attention; she’s nonchalant, though. She forgot to mention she knew tae kwon do. Meanwhile Tom Petty is blasting away. He’s getting all sweaty, this is making his day. (Editing note: the rest of this poem is missing. ) "

    "body": "(Evening) “I’m taking a bath,” I said. “Again?” she asked. “I worked all day.  I want to change before your friends come. ” “Okay.  I’ll finish this game, then I’ll join you. ”   My eyes looked to her face and its scars.  Hip-hop played loudly from a small, black boom box on the sink’s edge.  The casing of the speakers was personalized by faded bumper stickers and magazine clippings.  I still tasted the afternoon’s coffee on my tongue.  Her leg pushed against mine, as she reached to take and light a cigarette from the toilet top.  I watched the first smoke-wisp coil, like a serpent, before I could smell it. “This is out of nowhere,” she said, “But I hate when you hug me and kiss my forehead, then walk away.  It reminds me of my brother, the condescending economic theorist. ” “I’m sorry,” I said, adding: “I like that you smoke in the bathtub.  It’s eccentric. ” “Is it annoying that I get upset about little things? Is it worth it to deal with me?” “Ask your brother about worth.  Me, I’m reckless.  Your legs are smooth when you haven’t shaven. ” Around that point, I stopped looking at things, and listened instead to the lyrics of the music.   Later, standing in front of the stove, I rolled up my sleeve.  “Nice tea kettle,” I said, “Where’s the berry?” “Whatever-berry is to your left.  Earl Gray’s on the stovetop. ” “It’s cold in here. ” “Grow up,” she snapped.  The stove click-click-clacked until it caught.  Sitting, she kept her legs crossed as a man might, and clipped her toenails.  When a crescent-shaped section of nail hung by its edge, she pulled it with her fingers, for deposit into the trash.  The overhead lighting was unclean and yellowish. I was conscious of the refrigerator’s hum.   I had been collapsing her roommates’ old pizza boxes, resting them vertically between the kitchen trash and the wall.  I scurried to answer a knock at the door.  I hugged her two friends.  She hugged them, also.  I thought of our bath, of the way I’d examined her scars.  I imagined a giant tub, holding the four of us.  This one was filled with suds- a bubble bath, to obscure the view of her friends’ bodies.  I imagined myself taking a handful of bubbles, and blowing it at the others; they would laugh frivolously, joyous and clean.   I sat on the fire escape.  Below, one man ran after another, yelling.  I didn’t understand the language.  The automobile traffic was sparse, but impatient.  The moon was visible as a waning gibbous.  I spat.  My saliva swayed in the breeze, refusing to break the thin trail that connected it to me.  I wiped my mouth, feeling anti-social and somewhat cold.   She closed the door, waited for the sound of their footsteps on the stairs, then said, “You hate that I’m moving, don’t you? “I hate scorpions,” I replied, “The scorpions are going to bite you. ” “I hate skunks,” she said, leaning against the counter, “I want to know if they have skunks there.  I narrowly avoided getting skunked last year.  I had to walk back to that apartment one night, and I was so cold that I wasn’t looking out for anything, then there was just this skunk.  And I had to back away.  I took a detour, it took me like an extra five minutes because I didn’t want to walk through the skunk’s territory.  I hate skunks. ” “You’ll be stumbling through the desert seeing mirages, and a scorpion is going to bite you. ” “It’s an art thing.  I’ll self-destruct if I’m not around other artists. ” “I know.  The scene here is going nowhere.  But can’t you just marry me and stick around? We’ll buy a house. ” She crossed the room and hugged me.  “Maybe someday,” she said, “Once you’re willing to put out. ” I pushed her away, called her a mean name, and began eating chocolate.  She shook her head and left the room.   (After Midnight) The light was sudden and harsh.  I heard the sound of a plastic coffee mug being placed upon the bureau.  I blinked several times, wiping the sleep from my eyes.  My ex-wife was standing in an icy-blue ball gown.  Her face was made up.  She looked sad. “I didn’t expect to find you here,” she said. “Is the light being used to any particular end?” I grumbled. “Waking you up.  Did she leave you here alone?” “I don’t know.  I was curled around her like a vine.  Then there was light, and it wasn’t good. ” “I need a friend. ” “No.  You’ll kiss me again. ” “I won’t kiss you again. ” “I hate when you kiss me. ” “I won’t kiss you again. ” “I dreamed about scorpions. ” “I’m changing into her pajamas. ” “Okay. ”   I nudged the pajamas.  Their design portrayed crescent moons, napping peacefully in sleeping-caps.  My ex-wife adjusted her sitting position, making room between us for the portfolio.  The photographs were beautiful. “I’ve run out of things to say when you show me this caliber of work,” I said, “It’s all so fantastic. ” “So were the stories you used to write. ” “I wrote about you.  You were already fantastic. ” “So was he. ” In the photograph, a boy sat cross-legged, his arm extended, giving bread to a lone duck.  The boy wasn’t smiling: he wore a solemn expression, seeming confident, waiting patiently for the bird’s approach.  “He was like that when I found him.  It was a crowded park.  Plenty of people were passing by and could see that a kid was feeding ducks.  But how many people could recognize that expression of his?” “Recognize it?” “If you stare at him for long enough, you’ll see. ” I stared at the boy’s eyes.  They were focused, unwavering, the eyes of someone who knew his purpose.  I tried to discern what they had been looking at.  I felt a fresh wave of emotion; sadness emerged from my perception of the snapshot.  With each passing moment, as I continued to look at the photograph, my heart relaxed progressively from a tension I had never known was there.  Vulnerable, and deeply lonesome, I was about to panic. I looked up.  “Damn it!” my ex-wife exclaimed, throwing down her camera, “You ruined the shot. ” I scowled, closed the portfolio, and took a deep breath.   Her towel was a deep red.  “You two sound like you’re having fun,” she said, and smiled without looking at us.  I watched her hairbrush as it was thrust downward, quickly and repeatedly, through segments of hair.  With her back turned to us, I saw in the mirror that she relaxed her expression. “We were looking at photographs,” I said. “I used to stare at photographs for hours on end, when I was a teenager,” she volunteered, still facing the mirror, “My parents eventually took the books away during the week, and only let me have them on weekends when I’d finished my homework- meaning, I never saw them again. ” “I should get going,” said my ex-wife. “Don’t be polite, you’re wearing her pajamas,” I said, “You know that you’re welcome. ” “Of course your ex-wife is welcome in my apartment.  Anytime. ” She finished brushing her hair.  “I just have to find a different set of pajamas now. ” She started rummaging through the closet.   (Morning) I shivered.  She and my ex-wife had wrapped themselves snugly in the sheets, leaving none for me.  I wondered when they had come to bed.  Only their hair was visible.  I sat on the edge of the bed for a moment before standing. It was nearly sunrise.  I sat at the kitchen table and yawned.  I looked at the catalog for an electronics store.  They were discounting MP3 players, for one week only.  A smiling teenager posed with a skateboard.  His headphones were lost under medium-length hair.  I wondered if he had fallen in love with anyone yet, at that age.  Maybe he had.  Maybe that love already had left him.  Maybe they were still friends.  Maybe that love was still the only one who understood.  Maybe his parents were incapable of showing affection, and his days were spent hoping for human contact.  Maybe he would become an unlikely friend to me.  Maybe his mother would be the woman of my dreams. My thoughts were out of control.  I needed to bathe.  I gathered the pages I had written in the evening, and the pages I had written after midnight.  I was ready to cleanse them along with myself, to read them quietly aloud, to lay them ceremoniously into the water, as I had done with so many other pages.  I was ready to watch their secrets disappear. I opened the bathroom door.  A duck floated in a bath of stagnant water.  He looked hungry.  I was confused for a minute, but then I grew wings and flew out the window to the sky.  The duck watched stupidly. "

    "body": "1 So many of my memories of April were lost, because I wasn’t writing when we were spending the most time together. And now April is lost. 2 That will happen to the memories I preserve, too. They’ll go. There’s no preventing loss. 3 I lasted the full thirteen weeks of my job in Tacoma, Washington, starting in June and ending in September. I told my agency not to pursue an extension of the contract, because it was awful for a while. By the end, it’s true, I had settled into it, but the higher-ups in the company apparently really wanted me to follow policy that I did not think I could ethically follow. I was surprised it didn’t lead to issues when I didn’t budge on that. I got a good reference from my supervisor, even. Life is a mystery. Everyone must stand alone. 4 I’m not trying to capture Rhonda in here. Not trying to capture the relationship. The definitive version is not this. These are just notes that will help us remember. 5 After moving slowly, and after two months of her intensively working on her dissertation, she and I are making it happen. Walking Vancouver. Trying a few times and then finally succeeding at getting a karaoke room to ourselves. It was so much fun. The two of us finally spending nights together. Me getting a queen sized bed for my apartment. 6 A sixty-eight day work week, I think it was, with me driving often between Tacoma (where I worked five days a week) and Mount Vernon (where I worked two days a week) and Vancouver (where I technically lived). Staying in hotels and AirBnBs, some of them good, some of them bad. I did take one day off during those sixty-eight days, though, because I was stuck in traffic from a collision on I-5 while I drove from Tacoma toward Mount Vernon, so I was hours behind schedule, and I had plans with Rhonda that I didn’t want to cancel or postpone. 7 It seemed like my next job was going to be on Whidbey Island, which would have been nice—I could have driven home any nights I wanted—and that facility wanted me. I would have been doing hand therapy a lot of the time. But there was an intermediary company between the facility and my travel agency, I’m told, and per one of the people I interviewed with it was that intermediary who “dropped the ball” and I should definitely try again once the other contract I went with is over. 8 That contract I went with instead is for a job at a SNF in Omak, which is very rural Washington, just east of the Cascades. And one or two days a week I’m floating to Brewster, a town south of there. I’m staying in Canada, though, a little over an hour’s drive north—in Osoyoos, a sort of resort town that’s in the off-season now that it’s mid-September. The warmest summers in Canada, not a lot of rain, known as “Canada’s desert”. I feel a little more like I’m on vacation and a little less like I’m stranded in the middle of nowhere, being in Osoyoos. 9 And Rhonda and I plan for weekends. We can have Saturday evenings and Sundays during the day together in Vancouver. That’s about a five hour drive each way. 10 My Struggle: Book One by Karl Ove Knausgaard. I’ve started Knausgaard before, but I think I did it wrong. That was 2015, I think, or maybe the very end of 2014. I have a memory of listening to the first thirty minutes or so as an audiobook. And that has never worked out for me, listening to an audiobook. But if anywhere it would have worked it would have been while I was on a treadmill, where there wasn’t much going on to distract me. Except that my thoughts could distract me, too. Like, why did people love Knausgaard, I asked myself, when they detested every other Knausgaard-like person who dared to write about themselves? Thinking about this distracted me, so I would pause the audio as I continued to step. It was a small gym in a mid-rise apartment building in metro D. C. —the first apartment I was renting on a therapist’s salary. I could do what this Norwegian guy has done, I thought, remembering everything I had heard about My Struggle. And not only could I do this, but I pretty much had done this. The books were upstairs, vanity printed just for me to flip through like photo albums. And yet I was just a Knausgaard. I wasn’t the Knausgaard. And that made what I did feel childish. Sure, I was interested in My Struggle as I listened to it. But I was an easy mark—I would have an interest this sort of thing. Why would anyone else like it, though, in a world that convinced so many other Knausgaards that they should be hiding their notebooks in shame? I never got far into the audiobook. Audiobooks just don’t work for me. And I forgot about Knausgaard, more or less, even as I kept up my own writing, my own life-novel. 11 Until the summer of 2019, when the life-novel I was writing came to a natural end. I decided it would be a healthy thing to set the project down, even though working on it had been part of processing my life for more than twenty years, and even though I had come to imagine I would be working on it for the rest of my life, or, at least, for as long as I remained capable of doing so. 12 Now it’s October of 2019, and I think about how much of what I’m living now I won’t remember in five, ten, twenty years. But I had my reasons for wrapping up the old narrative. 13 The context won’t be the same. If I write about myself, my relationship to the written me will be different. 14 So, yes, it feels like a good time to buy a physical copy of My Struggle: Book One. It feels like a good occasion to give it another chance. 15 My girlfriend, Rhonda, is taking a couple of days away from her phone. She does this more weeks than not, lets me know in advance that she won’t be seeing my texts. It’s a good practice, I think—a good example for me. I’m sending her pictures, though, as my trip to Massachusetts winds down. I’ve flown back east for a four day trip to visit family and to go to my dear friend Sheela’s birthday party. Sheela’s birthday parties are always fun little low-key events with good people in attendance, and being in October they come at a time when New England is especially pretty and enjoyable to visit. I send pictures to Rhonda of Sheela and her daughter making a pizza together—a sweet scene from the night before the birthday party. I’m good with kids. I didn’t always knew that I was good with kids, though, because when I was in my teens and early twenties I assumed that most people wouldn’t want their kids associating with a guy who wore all black clothing, nail polish, had long hair, ran with the counterculture, and read books filled with dangerous ideas. If the world at large didn’t even want someone like me selling their labour for income, surely it was beyond my reach to be someone who’d be “good with kids”. Eventually I cut my hair and gave up on nail polish, but I still was seen as a potential danger when out in the world by myself. “Get over here!” bark parents when their kid wanders too close to me on a sidewalk or in a shopping mall. (It’s different when I’m with a woman. “She’s adorable,” the woman might say about a child. Imagine that!) But with friends and their children it’s different, of course. And to Isabella I’m Uncle Adam. And being present in a domestic scene is meaningful to me. I’m sending pictures to Rhonda of a lovely evening. But this is a simple pleasure, and the simple pleasures slip away if you don’t hang on to them. For years now I’ve been trying to hold on to the simple pleasures. And the simple challenges. The simple fears. Reading about the feelings I’ve had in my daily life has been able to focus me. It humanizes the me of the past for the me of the present. Who else cares? Who would care? I don’t know. I find that most of what moves me will move me only slightly, only briefly. Not all of my thoughts, my actions, or my observations are flattering ones, but at least when I look back on them I am reminded that the wave is not the tide. Halfway through the first volume of My Struggle, I feel like I’m enjoying it well enough, but then I can barely remember what I’ve read. Of course, I don’t remember all that much from Proust, either. Maybe my brain is too full of the minor details of various years of my life, and that’s why the characters in books all blend together for me. 16 A couple of months ago, on one of my trips to Portland, Oregon, another dear friend of mine, Dominic, refused to agree when I commented on how weird a lifestyle I had found my way into. “Lots of people have lives that can seem bizarre. There are a lot of ways to live a life,” he said. It was a wise thing to say, and he had it on the tip of his tongue. But it still feels weird. I have moved so often in my adult life, always alone, usually for practical reasons. And now I live in Canada while working in the United States, which is the country of my birth and the only place I had lived until about a year ago. I fall into a new routine every two weeks or so, it feels like. I start over, then start over, then start over. A quotidian reboot that for most people would be hugely jarring is for me just another Tuesday. 17 But I wrote my novel of education. The writing of that novel of education was my education. And I feel that my identity is a more stable thing now. And I want to make use of it. "

    "title": "I Wonder What My Name Will Be: A Time Between (102-110)",
    "body": "102 May 29, 2020. Sittin’ under a tree, on a hill covered in daisies, lookin’ at the beach and the picnickers and the sporty peeps and oh hey, I wonder what that bird is. This past week most of what I’ve been doing has been trimming and altering the first volume of Sunset and Dawn into a form more protective of the privacy of others. Sunset and Dawn: The Life Story of Levi Adams, I call that one, as distinct from Sunset and Dawn: The Life Story of Adam Marcel Ares, which I plan to donate to a library collection, and a possible version that would be even more comprehensive than that one, which would include chat logs and things like that that I don’t actually have the copyright on or anything but could pass down privately in case it might be of interest to over-curious scholars or whatever. A couple of people maybe ten metres away take turns running down, then up the hill for athletic reasons. It’s a cloudy day, and early in the afternoon, so not as many people are outside as normally they have been, particularly for a Friday. Yesterday I got so tired of encounters with people unconcerned with social distancing that I told myself I’d be staying in this weekend, that I wouldn’t go on any walks for the next few days. But today, I don’t know, the gray sky called. I am wearing black pants—just dress pants or whatever. My leather shoes because, I don’t know why. The t-shirt River gave me from the “House of Vans” Against Me! concert they went to in Brooklyn at some point, although most of the time I have only worn it at home, like with sweatpants for pajamas, because the design is not pleasant to look at. Yesterday I was intimidated by the public washrooms here along the beaches, but they’ll be less crowded this time, I think. Let me see… Yeah, it was fine. And I’m on a different hill, now, with fewer daisies and more goose poop… but also a view of the mountains in the distance, and more of a view of the water. Now, what was I writing about? My hand touched some goose poop as I sat down, so I’m having a hard time focusing, now. I hope there’s no goose poop on the seat of my pants or anything. I sort of want a beer, but I’m not at the point of wanting to go to a pub or restaurant, even though Rhonda did just that, sat on a patio and drank a beer and ate some wings at a place she passed by while walking around by herself on her free intuition day. (After her period had arrived, indicating that she did not get pregnant this month. ) So, yes, the new version of Sunset and Dawn—I’m going through it with the intention of what I make it this time being a publishable multi-volume autofiction novel. The plan I’m kicking around in my head is to sit on it until I’m older, but I don’t know. I’m just focused on making it something that would be practically and ethically publishable, and putting things like 100 Pages on the backburner—I have lots of that ready anyway, have had it readied in advance—because replacing a gazillion names and keeping track of what has and has not been modified in a novel that is thousands of pages long requires a lot off focus, which is difficult if I don’t consistently (like, every day) have blocks of time in which to do the work. Now is really the time to go through and do this thing, because I don’t know when I might get the chance again. Rhonda, I’ve found, really gets thrown off if I stay awake too late and wake up too late, so I’ve been up in the mornings and going to sleep more or less with her not too long after midnight, even if that requires my taking melatonin. She gets depressed for several days and then gets better for several days, that’s how it’s been looking lately, and when she’s depressed she sleeps a lot… so it isn’t that she has a steady sleep schedule. But it appears to make things worse if I’m, like, staying up until sunrise and sleeping in until one in the afternoon, or whatever. So, I’m doing what I can. Hm… the sun is coming from behind the clouds, now. I find this vaguely unpleasant. I might need to leave my spot on this hill soon. I have of course never been a person to enjoy sitting in the sun. Beachgoing always seemed like a weird thing to me. It occurs to me, though, as I sit near the beach, that I would feel sketchy if instead of on this hill I were down there on the sand, by myself. It’s a group activity, mostly, and one that almost always involves a woman. A man sitting alone on the beach would be scary to most eyes. I have no examples of this within my line of sight. Rhonda likes going to the beach, sitting in the sun on a sandy beach. It might be interesting to try going with her sometime. Having so much control over my life, as I do during this pandemic, makes me healthier and more productive than I ever have been (with the exception of last summer, when I was unemployed and working on the ending of Sunset and Dawn and in that case sort of just waiting for Rhonda to emerge from her deep dive into dissertation work). I can imagine it being really hard for me to return to a life of full-time wage-earning work after this. But, that’s not my initial plan, anyway… and if Rhonda and I end up with a kid, then everything’s gonna change anyway… 103 It sounds like it’s basically the Arab Spring down there in the States. Trump is tweeting that he’ll declare Antifa a terrorist organization. Of course, there is no such thing as Antifa: it is only a label indicating that one is anti-fascist. So, it could become anti-American to speak up against Fascism. My opinion on this all is: what is America? I’ve never heard of it. Is it a nice place? I would try to visit, you know, but there’s so much to see in the world, and only so much time! As I try not to be haunted by the ghosts. 104 June 15, 2020. Last week I tutored once online and once in person. I was nervous during the online session and felt good during the in person session. I have my engagement ring, with the 1 carat diamond Rhonda inherited from her stepmom Wendy placed in a simple 18 karat white gold ring. It looks great. My wedding band, meanwhile, has arrived in Massachusetts. It’s basically the ring I really wanted at Tiffany and Co. , but an older, used one. It’s in exactly my size and less than half of what it would have cost new, so it felt right to jump on buying it. It’s in Massachusetts because I was having trouble ordering it, potentially because of my being in Canada, so I just had my mom place the order and it be sent to her there south of the border. I finished onboarding (taking online training and uploading documents) for the job doing residential care. I have a four hour orientation day at a place in North Vancouver the day after tomorrow. 105 June 23, 2020. I probably broke my toe, plus Rhonda had a bit of a cough and I was possibly feeling under the weather too, so I put off starting at Strive. Now I’m set for orientation on the 26th, and the student I tutored in person has requested ongoing Saturday sessions. I had First Aid training for Strive today; it was better led than other First Aid trainings I’ve had, although I have criticisms about how some things were done given the COVID-19 situation, what was changed and not changed. I’ve been focused on finishing the Levi version of Sunset and Dawn as efficiently as I can, so letting myself not write much in here. Rhonda has reportedly had some really productive days working on her dissertation. My unemployment money from Washington came in; I’ve transferred enough into Canada to serve as an emergency fund and plan to pay off my credit cards using the rest of it. I’ve also bought niceties for myself—I’ve ordered a new computer from a company in Germany that builds completely free/libre laptop systems running Linux, along with a new record player and nice speakers that both work with it and work using bluetooth to play files from my computer and streaming from phones. And for the outside balcony I finally got a chair and a couple of little tables, giving us another nice area for sitting and doing work or whatever. When I say I probably broke my toe, I mean that I stubbed my toe on the day I wrote my last entry here—which was eight days ago, if you do the math—and when it kept hurting I decided to try staying off it for a few days. Then it seemed to be feeling better, but then it wasn’t. Yesterday I called my doctor’s office, and a telephone appointment was scheduled for this morning. (Telehealth is becoming much more a thing now than it ever was before, for obvious reasons. ) But the doctor didn’t call this morning, so I called in the afternoon when I was back home from the First Aid training, and then I did get my call, and she told me she would have a referral for x-rays sent to me by email. But I still haven’t been sent a referral. 106 I get the referral, make the appointment, go to the place to get an x-ray done of my foot. “We’ll get it to the doctor, and usually you’ll get a call in one to two days,” he says at first. Then, though, as I’m getting my shoes on, he says, “Hey, this is your first time getting it x-rayed, though? Probably you should try calling your doctor later today. It looks like it’s broken. ” So I do, but they say they haven’t received the x-ray. And when I call the next day, I’m told the same thing. Rhonda seems surprised that what she’s been seeing is how I act with a broken toe: “You’re so stoic. ” Maybe. Literally my first thought after I hit my toe was that I wanted to say “Ow!” very loudly and start hopping on my unaffected foot so that she would look over and see that I had just stubbed my toe and not worry that I had done something more damaging to myself. So, maybe. I don’t hear anything on Friday. Then it’s the weekend, and I just try to stay off it as much as possible, although that especially doesn’t really work on Friday, when I’m orientated at one of the group homes for Strive and it doesn’t occur to any of the employees to minimize my walking as they show me where the fire extinguisher is in one room and where the laundry is done in another and how things are kept out here in the shed, yes, just out the door and all the way across the patio, yeah, as you can see there isn’t really much that you’ll ever need to get out of here, so anyway let’s go back inside… (But everything looks great at the home, at least with regard to what I think it’ll be like when all of my digits are unfractured. ) I do a second tutoring session with the same student I saw in person the last time. And on Monday I call the doctor’s office again. They confirm that the x-rays were received but say that it’s not an urgent situation so my appointment for a phone call can be scheduled no sooner than for next Monday. 107 The discomfort of walking decreases as the days pass. It still slows me down, though. 108 I walk a few walks to pick up some records that I bought online but for which I still need to pay some taxes or something, since they were shipped from the States. On the way, a guy carrying a boombox that is blasting “The Whole World” by Outkast throws his drink cup at my back and says, “You didn’t have to walk in front of me!” or something? Because I guess my attempts to follow social distancing guidelines on a fairly crowded sidewalk while people entered and exited stores killed his groove or whatever? I stand still in the spot where his cup hit me. I watch him with a neutral expression. “Faggot!” he says. He starts to come at me, so I back up into the entrance of the Best Buy I happen to be standing in front of. “Hey,” I say to the guy at the door. “I hope you don’t mind, I’m just getting away from an angry man. ” I go up the escalator, then feel silly about letting this guy interfere so much with my simple trip to the store and go back down the escalator. “Thanks,” I say to the guy as I exit. I walk to the London Drugs. Unfortunately, there’s a wait to get in, and the boombox-carrying homophobe, despite his anger at being slowed down earlier, has not made haste getting to the end of the block. He veers toward me as he passes. I turn one hundred eighty degrees so that I don’t let him out of my sight, although I also avoid eye contact. As I’m about to get into the London Drugs I tell the person managing the line, “Hey, just so you know, the guy with the jukebox there threw a cup at me and then sort of came at me. So, I don’t know what’s going on with him. ” “Well, the thing is,” she says, “That there is city property, so it wouldn’t be something we could handle. ” “No,” I say, “I’m just saying, since there are other people out here, and you’re out here, that he’s someone who was causing trouble. ” She doesn’t seem interested. I go in, pick up my records from the Canada Post desk inside. I text Rhonda and tell her about the guy just in case. But then I exit and I don’t see him again, only walk awkwardly back home, trying to keep weight off my broken foot. 109 In the weeks that follow, I don’t bother to write anything down about the content of my days. I focus on Sunset and Dawn. I think I might never have finished making it into what it is without the thousands of hours of free time given to me by the pandemic. I finally talk on the phone with my primary care physician, three weeks after I hurt my toe. She tells me that yes my toe was broken and that “buddy taping” it to the toe next to it would be a good idea, although by now it is almost too late for this to make a difference. Phone appointments with doctors are a new thing for everyone, but I am livid about the way she dismisses me when I try to ask questions. “Do you want me to tell you my suggestion?” she asks, and I am baffled for a second because she already has told me, and I have just tried to ask clarifying questions. She makes it clear that she just wants to say the words she always says about a broken toe, then take her reimbursement for providing this knowledge, and not worry about whether what she is saying is understood by me. I listen to her and resolve not to use her as a medical provider again. The next day, I hit the same toe in the same place in the same way, and then it feels worse again. This time I call an urgent care place, and they’re willing to do a phone appointment with me the next day, and they send me to get a new x-ray that same day, and the day after that the doctor calls me and explains in detail the nature of the fracture and what to do while it’s healing. It’s a vastly different experience. I keep putting the new 100 Pages issues and podcasts up, although I don’t bother to promote them at all. For maybe five weeks in a row I’m tutoring that same high school student, but then I’m told something something vacation something maybe in September, and no other students have been assigned to me, so I assume that company just isn’t bothering with me anymore. Strive gets me oriented at a couple of other houses, though, so I start working more often there. Laura-Lee and Rick come over to the apartment one night. Rhonda cooks dinner, they bring dessert, we have some beers. We go camping with Priscilla. I realize I’m afraid of camping in the woods (afraid of bears, mostly) and spend much of the night in Priscilla’s van. The next day we walk out over rocks to a stream or a river or whatever. The two of them get into the water. I climb over a bunch of dead wood for fun, then wander to the edge of the trees to try to hide from the sun, then head back to the van to sit and read. Fortunately, for Rhonda, the experience overall is good—I didn’t ruin anything with my fear of bears and whatnot. I’ll have to remember that I don’t like camping, though. Then I meet Rhonda’s half-sister, Kerri. We sit on the outdoor patio of a pub in Richmond, then head to her place and sit in the fenced-in outside patio with the dog and cat. It’s nice. 110 August 20, 2020. We’re not bothering anymore to try to plan for a wedding reception in Massachusetts. Hopefully someday it’ll be reasonable and practical to plan a trip there, and once that can happen we’ll try to plan for a celebration of some sort. "

The one thing everybody knows about a man’s great book is the author’s masculine greatness. I love Sunset and Dawn, the book I made out of my life story, the book that I wrote an ending for earlier this year. But I don’t know what to do with it. I’ve started trying to fictionalize it somewhat, but I don’t know. It’s a challenge. One point something million words. How to make it readable and meaningful without making it devastating to me or to anyone I’ve written about? 19 And what of this urge to write to preserve? What is the mature way to respect that urge, to hold on to these moments? 20 The weekend before last: Dominic coming to Vancouver to visit me for the first time. I got my apartment in May. “You have the perfect apartment,” he said. And Rhonda joined us the next day. We went to her place and she made us a meal. Then we went out to karaoke at Funky Winker Bean’s. I didn’t feel like singing. The vibe wasn’t right for it. Someone came up and talked to me while Rhonda and I were looking at the song list. He asked if Rhonda and I were a couple and I said yes and he left right away. I wasn’t sure if he had hoped to flirt with me, with Rhonda, or if a discussion had been taking place on the topic of my sexual orientation, or what. Rhonda and Dominic both did great. The strong masculine energy of the dive bar was offset in a good way by an influx of what were clearly musical theatre students, if not professionals. A whole group of them did “Holiday” by Green Day with undeniable energy and talent. I said something about how they had been toddlers in Canada at the time that song was released, but by the end of the night I was regretting that tiresome observation I had made, and when Dominic turned back on me a silly question I had posed—“What did you learn tonight?”—my answer was, “I learned how to stop worrying and love 20-year-olds singing Green Day. ” 21 Dominic slept in the tiny closet room that I keep a twin mattress in. Rhonda and I shared my still relatively new queen sized mattress, which I had had shipped to me through the mail. On Sunday we all went and met up with an Internet friend of Dominic’s and their partner. It was at a doughnut place. Rhonda saw someone she knew while she was there… See? How do I keep a written record of things without bringing other people’s business into it? But, okay. I’ll just need to figure these things out as I go. After all, I don’t need to write about Rhonda seeing someone she knew, let alone who that person was, let alone how she said she felt about it. 22 My Struggle seems to pick up when it gets to the death of the author’s father. I believe that’s also the part that made his relatives angry: the details of his mother’s impaired cognition, the descriptions of the filth that had to be cleaned. It’s the sort of scene that I can understand being unforgettable when you’ve lived through it. And the process of writing about a scene like that, one that has burned itself into your mind, can itself be unforgettable, can change a person. 23 Just as I was planning to start making moves toward whatever my next therapy gig would be, I got news that my contract would be ending two weeks early, because a permanent therapist had been found. Okay… except the timing is pretty bad, given my plans to take the week of Christmas off to stay with Rhonda’s cousins in Alberta. But, of course, scrambling to fit opportunities and privileges together in a way that lets me survive is beyond familiar to me. Start over, then start over. Start over again. 24 Rhonda had agreed to get my keys from Dominic after he left (the morning after I drove back to Osoyoos). I told her to feel free to spend as much time as she wanted there in my apartment during the week. She spent Thursday night there, and on Friday when I came home again she was there to greet me. What followed was a weekend inside, with lots of trips taken to the grocery store on my block but otherwise spent mostly on the couch thing, or in bed, or preparing coffee or food in the kitchen area. 25 I probably won’t read more Knausgaard after I finish the first volume. In the short term, at least, I will have plenty of fine Scandinavian content in my life as I continue to watch episodes of the Danish series Rita on my Airbnb host’s Roku. 26 The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion. This book probably won’t take me long to read. Another book of non-fiction written around the topic of a death in the family. I didn’t do that intentionally. I didn’t even remember what the book was about, if you can believe that, when I searched for it on the shelves of the Indigo up in Kelowna. Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. Another new location. I think sometimes about making a map of all the places I’ve been, if I could easily do so. Google Maps theoretically allows one to do this, and River used to make maps of all sorts of things, including places to get good ramen, places they and I had visited together, and places to cry in New York City. But that feature doesn’t create anything I’d want to look at afterwards. I envision dots and lines easily drawn between each other. A dot in Nadi, Fiji. A web of roads connecting all the towns in western Massachusetts. Long distances highlighted along US interstates I’ve taken: I-90, I-80, I-70, I-95, I-5. I drove up to Kelowna, and it was a beautiful drive, it really was, especially that last bit driving north from Penticton, which previously had been the farthest north I had driven from Osoyoos. (I had flown out of Penticton to Vancouver that one weekend—really, was it only last month?—to meet Rhonda in Vancouver and drive a rental car back to Osoyoos so she could visit with me and stay at my AirBnB. And we drove up there to get my car from the airport parking lot, too, and we walked the downtown, which I liked because I still enjoy storefronts and coffee shops and book shops and record shops, as I search for Northampton, Massachusetts wherever I go [except when I’m in Massachusetts]. ) It was a busy shopping night there in Kelowna, though, and I was in town on pressing but also mundane business, the sort of Kafkaesque Saturday afternoon nightmare that I have learned to expect on at least a quarterly basis concomitant with my endeavoring to tread water as a solo practitioner of life, neither wealthy nor able to count on always having a support network in my proximity. So, yeah, I developed no affection for that small city, although, maybe next time I’ll find the chance to enjoy it more. All I experienced of Kelowna was stoplights along a single drive lined with the parking lots for retail chain stores, because I was there with a phone that wouldn’t boot up past the Apple logo that showed when it was first turned on. Making matters quite a bit worse was the fact that I had forgotten my laptop in Vancouver the previous weekend. I’m belabouring the point of what brought me to the bookshop where I purchased this copy of Joan Didion’s slim volume of memoir about the death of her beloved husband, but that is sort of just how I’m writing now, I think, now that I’m trying to find some way to record these things I’m experiencing as a human living on Earth but also trying to break away from certain habits that I was getting into while writing myself as the protagonist of a novel. Does every narrator get trapped inside a novel if they show too much of themselves and carry on for too long? Is that their punishment? Or is it a condition of life that we are here to celebrate? Anyway, on Friday night, the night before I ended up in Kelowna, I drove from my contract job at the skilled nursing facility in Omak, Washington to my AirBnB in Osoyoos, British Columbia, and at some point I think my phone just froze up out of nowhere, and I tried restarting it, but then, yeah, like I said, it just got stuck at the Apple logo. And then plugging it in didn’t work. Letting the battery run out and then recharging it didn’t work. The next morning I woke up with no way to know the time other than a general recognition of the position of the sun in the sky. I looked at some tourism pamphlets the AirBnB hosts left in my living room; they didn’t mention any destinations that seemed likely to offer Internet terminals, let alone iPhone troubleshooting services, but I took them with me when I left in my car for the day, just in case they would come in handy. The first town north of Osoyoos is Oliver, and there I lucked out and spotted the public library. I used a computer there to look up places that might be able to do something for my phone, although I was distressed to see that there were no actual Apple stores in this part of the province. I drove up to Penticton, then, and when I couldn’t find the place I was looking for I tried instead the Staples office supply store, which I knew would have computer terminals I could pay to use by the minute. There was also an electronics repair desk there, and I asked about my phone and they said there was nowhere they knew of that would help me any closer than Kelowna. But in Kelowna, they said, there would be an official Apple reseller, not a corporate store but a place similar to one, where they would probably help me out, inside a big shopping mall. I thanked the associate, printed out directions from the computer terminal, and kept driving north. Inside the shopping mall I found the store, and some associates there hooked my phone up to a computer that had the iTunes software on it to try to get it updated or restored or whatever. And I was told to come back in fifteen minutes and so I did, but then I was told by someone different that the process was only partway completed, so I should come back in another fifteen minutes or so. So I spent some time inside Indigo, bought The Year of Magical Thinking along with The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and I went back to check on my phone. But then they realized the process of updating my phone had somehow stopped, and the store was going to be closing soon so they directed me to go to the London Drugs just down the street. I was very hungry, so I first went to the food court and ate some not very good pad seew, which I ordered spicy but which was not spicy. Then I went to London Drugs, where ane employee hooked up my phone to iTunes and told me to browse around and check back in a bit. I did that. I checked back. Still not finished. I walked around some more, looking at computers, speakers, phones, cereal, cookies. Still not finished. This went on for a while, with the prognosis alternating between “something seemed to go wrong” and “it definitely seems to be doing what it should” along the way. Ultimately my phone did not get fixed. I could leave it there to be repaired, the employee said, and that would probably take several days. Of course, such a timeline wouldn’t work for me, particularly because my work contract was to be ending two weeks sooner than I was expecting and I am now in the process of trying to find and apply for jobs, and there are employers I am hoping to hear from soon. So, I drove that night back to Osoyoos… and then to Vancouver. The total distance driven for the day was about 400 miles. This on the weekend I had chosen to skip seeing Rhonda, as I usually would have, because I wanted to avoid the driving and enjoy a couple of days without feeling the imperative to be doing any particular thing. Alas. On Sunday morning I woke up in my apartment in Vancouver. I walked to the Apple store at Pacific Centre. Someone there was able to restore my phone without issue. Just one of the reasons living in a major city is underrated. And then I drove all the way back to Osoyoos that night, probably through snow and ice and all the rest of it. Oh, wait, no, that was the drive to Vancouver, which was all at night. That drive was snowy and icy through the mountains. Oh, and I was sick with a cold through all of that. And I’ve been sick these past few days of being back at work. Now it’s 1:00 AM on American Thanksgiving. I’ll be working in the morning. But for now I’m writing about myself and the weekend during which I bought the Joan Didion book that I just started reading, which it’s not impossible I’ll finish reading tomorrow, although more likely it’ll take me until next week, since I want to send out more job applications tomorrow night, and since then on the weekend I’m planning to go back to Vancouver for another weekend with my lovely lover, Rhonda.

    "body": "27 I really wanted to go out dancing when I made it to Vancouver on 1st of December—I think that was the date this past Saturday—but I was still not feeling well, and it seemed Rhonda and I had lots to talk about, and we just didn’t make it out of my apartment that night. As I drove back to Osoyoos the next day I thought about how much it says about my priorities that I’ve been driving this distance, making a drive perilous enough that I’ve intentionally not been mentioning the peril of it to anyone, and doing it every weekend, and that I’ve been spending all or most of these weekends with Rhonda before then turning back around and doing that same drive again. It’s exactly what I want to be doing… …and it feels like an exceptional length to go to, and to some extent it is. But it’s also just the sort of thing that people do when they’re together as a unit. It’s what you do when you have a partner; it’s what you do when you have family. People work long hours, commute great distances, endure discomfort that doesn’t feel like discomfort but in fact feels like a blessing and a privilege to be able to do. Folks are out there who have been together and loved each other for decades. To put effort into building a stable collaboration of life is not a new idea, although most of the relationships I’ve observed have not been so perfect. I have envied very few people’s personal lives. But family is a thing because families have sometimes worked. And my autonomous functioning in society has been a roller coaster ride, ascending and then descending with little warning. And communities of identity, which for some are a good alternative to the traditional family unit, are terrifying to me—I fear that the pitchforks will be turned on me when I fail to understand some protocol—so working consistently with someone to be a family, to make a family? It feels like a desirable path, given that I’ve found someone it is thrilling to imagine doing that with, who demonstrates that she feels similarly. People have sometimes loved each other well, I am reminded. 28 I’m happy to be finishing this time in Osoyoos, Omak, and Brewster. Not because they aren’t nice places. They are nice places, for certain people who are not me. I’ve just been feeling increasingly bored by and sort of lonely because of the lack of public spaces to spend my time in. I like feeling welcome inside spaces that are not where I sleep and are not where I work. Spending time in spaces like that feels like progress, even if I’m paying for the privilege, as at a coffee shop or pub. I feel accomplished when I sit somewhere with a book, around other people, inhabiting my me-ness, without feeling anyone’s hostility. Things are not like they were when I was younger, I can think. The social order primes us to attack when we see signals of a person who is not in want. We know that if a person is not suffuse with the imperative to gain, they are expected to be made so. I like flaunting my satiety. The wealthy in their freedom rarely laze, and yet every social class treats laziness as if it is a threat to society. As if cities are being burned to the ground because of too much nap-taking. Yes, it’s true: I feel rebellious when I sit in a coffee shop, enjoying my time, wishing for nothing that could be purchased by bank notes of any colour. 29 I finish my work contract. I drive back to Vancouver. I go with Rhonda to a work dinner, sit at a long table next to her for a couple of hours and feel self-conscious about how quiet I am, sitting and feeling impatient for the appetizer, then the entree, then the dessert. 30 The Art of Memoir by Mary Karr. I’ve started with three books in a row by white authors. This trend will not continue. But the trend of memoir will, I think, continue, because I’m realizing that what I’m looking for in my reading right now is insight into my own process of life writing, what to do with my conflicting thoughts about how to keep writing about my life and to what end I want to imagine I am doing it. This book seems like an obvious choice for me right now; I bought it when it first came out (2015?) but at this point, like the book of Knausgaard that I believe I once bought, I’m ready to accept that it was probably stolen in one of the two car break-ins I have been subject to in the past few years. (I know better, or should know better than to leave bags of my belongings visible in my car when I leave it parked on a city street. But I do unwise things sometimes. ) So, while I was in Portland for a few days with Rhonda this past week, when I brought her to the obvious destination that is Powell’s Books, this was one of the purchases I made for myself. And as the routines of my life change once again—I no longer have any reason to be driving across the Cascades to Osoyoos, British Columbia, no longer have any reason to be engaging with ranchers from rural Washington—it doesn’t feel like the right time to start, say, The Autobiography of Malcolm X. So it’s time for Mary Karr, that undeniable personality, whose classic The Liar’s Club I read a couple of years ago but did not fully absorb for some reason. What I remember most about Mary Karr, aside from her distinctive voice, is that I remember her saying, when I saw her in discussion at the 92nd Street Y, that she had a habit of jogging around the Central Park reservoir (which I walked many times, never jogged, while I was living in New York), and also that she does not think Knausgaard’s acclaim is in proportion to the quality of his work. (She suggests that a woman writing a similar work would not be lauded in the same way, which I think is fair to say. ) Now that I have written that terrible sentence, I will mention that I have spent the past couple of days feeling sad and scared. The trip to Portland that I’ve mentioned wasn’t as easy as expected. To what extent is it fair to write about another person’s distress? Joan Didion, in The Year of Magical Thinking, didn’t reveal anything about what her daughter went through when she emerged from an induced coma. She didn’t write about how her daughter handled the death that was at the center of the book. And it’s inconceivable that this didn’t have an effect on her. A living person has first rights to the account of their own struggles, even when those struggles have significant effects on a person who is writing about themselves: was that an idea in Didion’s mind? Everybody but me knows a lot about Joan Didion, I’m sure. But what I’m thinking about isn’t really about Didion; it’s about the ethics of memoir more generally. What about Maggie Nelson, whose book The Argonauts was in form and substance about her own identity, but whose treatment of the topic of her partner’s gender within the context of a cis woman’s autobiographical narrative has been criticized because, after all, trans people have their own stories to tell, from their own perspective, which arguably are drowned out in the public discourse when their stories are told second hand by a more privileged narrator? So what do I write here about Rhonda? I think, at this point in time, I just write that she wanted to go to Portland to me, that she wanted to come with me to places I have enjoyed, but that the experience was complicated for her. And I should add that when we returned to Vancouver I dropped her off at the school where she preps students for university admission tests and applications. Then I napped. Then I woke up to a series of text messages from her that were scary in a way that messages from her have never really been scary before. She and I both, when there is something we want to communicate to the other partner, tend to write what we want to say in notes on our phone. Then, the next time we’re together, we either read the notes verbatim or keep them as reference during our discussion. This time, I suggested that we might benefit from postponing an in-depth talk. I asked if she would want to go to a movie the next day. I said it might be nice to just sit and hold hands for a couple of hours. I was surprised, when she arrived at International Village, that she looked in such good spirits. I was anxious. It hadn’t helped that while I had been waiting a man with a beaten-up face, holding something appearing to me weapon-like, something like a metre-long section of piping?, had approached me to start telling a story of woe. He had said something about jewelry and pointed to several rings that were on his hand. I too was wearing jewelry that night. I almost never did. I hate standing still even under the best of circumstances, and there in front of the McDonald’s inside this urban shopping centre I had then needed to stare into space, waiting for Rhonda, while the man I had refused to help, of whom I was now wary, had himself continued to stand, looking to my anxious mind like some kind of villain from Blade Runner. Rhonda and I got some McDonald’s, then we saw the Tom Hanks movie about the children’s television show host Fred Rogers, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It was a good movie. 31 I don’t want for much except stability and to be able to relax a bit more. I have a general course that I know I’d like my life to take, and I have only so much control over to what extent I’ll be able to follow that course. I think about this a few nights later, at the end of a couple of days that have been necessarily about planning, the consideration of practicalities, the various online password entering and bus schedule consulting and telephone hold music enduring that it takes to maintain any occasional freedom in this world and to avoid having one’s agency thwap fatally against a brick wall. While cleaning to the sounds of a CD from one of my old cases of CDs—Boxer by The National, an album I maybe never have listened to in its entirety but whose sangfroid I maybe was hoping would seep into me tonight—my brain starts churning out the chorus of what it occurs to me could be a song. So I turn off The National, and I pull out my guitar from my weird uncomfortable sofa-thing. I haven’t played a note on anything since this time last year. And I strum some chords, write down four lines that I have started to sing at low volume, and then… I stare at the page. These things take effort, and my energy wants to go elsewhere. If I loved to play music, it would inspire me to push through. I could write this into a song, probably, as I have written my inspiration into a hundred other songs, although most of those songs were written in the decade before the decade that is now ending. “I was never violent,” I sing. “But I knew the violence. And when the violence slapped me around I said, ‘That’s just fine’. ” I want the lyric to be “Now that’s mine” instead of “that’s just fine”, but I know right away that it could only be the latter, which is less original but more true. But the song won’t go anywhere from there. I like my old songs. I still want to re-record some of them. Rhonda has been very kind about my music, has listened to and quoted and complimented a lot of what she has heard. But I would feel less joy in writing a song nowadays than I feel in putting words together. And at this moment, there are a dozen other things I would rather be putting effort into than a song I would hate to have to play in front of an audience. I am thirty-eight years old. And every age means different things to different people, but to me being thirty-eight means I would rather hear your new melodies than bear your interpretations of my own. 32 Cousins by Patricia Grace. Keeping a written record of my life in some form is still, I think, a good idea, particularly because it has become so routine for me to keep everything organized, formatted, and printed for myself. When I think back on the times in my life when I didn’t write much down about what was happening, I’m sad about the memories that are gone forever. The year 2006 comes to mind: I was dating April for much of that year, but I don’t really remember much about it, because I didn’t write much down. And although I wrote about her a fair amount before then (when we dated the first time) and after then (as we remained friends but I was often living out of state), now that she’s gone I wish there were more to memorialize her. However weird it might feel to write down a one-sided story about someone else, once a person is gone and can’t speak for themselves anymore it becomes clear that, so long as someone has been written about with respect and compassion, those second-hand impressions are valuable things. Most of us don’t leave a whole lot of us behind when we go. Tutankhamon, sure. Shakespeare, sure. But how many movie stars can most of us name who were working seventy-five years ago? How many world leaders from a hundred fifty years ago? I, for one, will take what I can get when it comes to people holding onto whatever positive inspiration they might take from me. And I’m thirty-eight years old; this isn’t youth anymore, for me or for my peers. So, preservation still feels important. But I also still think that the way I used to do this writing has run its course. It did what it needed to do for me. I don’t want this writing to be a novel about me anymore. That’s not where I’m at in life anymore. Jack Kerouac wanted to be a “running Proust”, writing about his life as it happened, and I know that idea got into my head when I was a teenager and inspired me as my journaling accumulated. And now I have a novel of my life that is about the length of Proust’s—probably a little shorter, but well over a million words edited, trimmed, and polished over the years. The process of keeping that project going as I lived my life kept me focused on where I was going, kept me attuned to trends in my consciousness that I wouldn’t otherwise have noticed. (It’s harder to lie to yourself when the context of what you’re trying to say is right there in black and white, and when you’ve re-read your past mistakes over and over again. ) So, now? Now the organizing principle is not that I am a protagonist finding himself and his place in society. The organizing principle is that I am keeping other people’s stories alive in the most sincere ways that I can, given the skills I’ve developed. We’ll see what that turns into. But that multi-volume novel of my life story—do I want to do anything with that? I still don’t know. 33 Anyway. This past Christmas was my first with my Rhonda. I flew with her to Alberta to stay with her cousin and her cousin’s family in the town of Vulcan (where the street signs are Star Trek themed and stuff—life takes me to some absurd locations). One of the many delightful things about Rhonda is that she is no less appreciative of literary texts than I am, and so exploring the several shelves of books that she had left at the home of her dear relatives inspired me to find extra room in my luggage and bring probably a half dozen of them back to Vancouver. Cousins was one of these books. The only other Kiwi author I have read is Janet Frame (of whose works Rhonda has several, because she wrote, I think, her Master’s thesis on her? Although Rhonda is Canadian and has, like me, never been to New Zealand). Patricia Grace, unlike Frame, writes from a Māori perspective, and although I am on a memoir kick right now the style of this book as I glimpsed it from flipping through, along with the outline of the premise as the back cover explained it to me, was enough to make me really curious. And I’m on page 28 right now, and I’m already wondering—will I ever read a novel by an author from New Zealand whose prose does not feel like it is wrapping tentacles around me and drawing me slowly into a damp, lightless, rotting old pantry where it intends to drown me in a mop bucket? Because that was Janet Frame, too. (But I’m not saying this is a bad thing. ) "

    "body": "34 My job situation is ramping up to what I’m planning as my new normal. Two jobs, each of them two and a half hours away from where I live, in the US, while I live in Canada. The plan is to generally have Mondays off, to commute down on Tuesdays, stay in a hotel, commute back on Wednesdays, then commute both ways on Thursdays. Then to have Fridays off, to commute down on Saturdays and to stay in a hotel on Saturdays. And maybe then, because I think 2020 would be a good year to spend focused on work, I’ll also look into what sort of work I might do on Mondays and Fridays in Vancouver. Rhonda has mentioned to the place where she teaches test prep classes for high school students that I would be interested in working for them, so I’ll probably send them my resume tomorrow. I could also look into jobs relating to mental health (although I still can’t work as an OT in Canada yet), since I think I’d like to pivot into that area as a therapist in the future. 35 The weekend was spent with Rhonda. This was the 11th and 12th of January. The start of January is maybe my favourite time of year; I always say that New Year’s Eve is my favourite holiday, followed by New Year’s Day, and there is a pleasant discombobulation effect that I think hangs over into the first couple weeks of January, wherein nobody feels really secure in what day of the week it is or when businesses should be open, and with the weather in many northern climes being at its worst then, and with people tending to make few plans, staying in, having spent too much money over the holidays, it is the time of peak humility. But that’s an aside. What about the weekend with Rhonda? It was a weekend spent indoors, mostly, although on Saturday I went over to her place, started uploading some reorganized collections of my old music for streaming services (since I still don’t have Internet at my apartment—not worth it), and we took the city bus through a cold Vancouver drizzle to a battle of the bands type event where Rhonda’s friend Jeni from Scotland, the owner of the yoga studio she goes to, was having us meet her, because her neighbour’s band was playing there. We got there just before that band went on, but Jeni hadn’t realized they would only be doing three songs, and since they were the last to go on it was a brief concertgoing experience indeed. I suggested that we head somewhere else for a round of drinks, but that didn’t happen, so Rhonda and I just went back to my place, where we also spent most of the next day, lounging in pajamas. Rhonda, after our many days together over the holidays, had fallen into depression, and I had silently worried that this would pull her away from the trajectory she had been talking about, the plans for her to start moving things into my apartment and to spend increasing amounts of time here before moving in this coming May or June. But this weekend she still talked about that as a plan, even if we didn’t get around to driving over to her place to pick up any of her stuff. I put on a DVD she had uncovered of home movies from when she was a teenager, and it was fascinating. What really made me want to keep watching was the context, seeing her friends and family. Her mother, whom I’ll never be able to meet. Her stepfather. And it hadn’t occurred to me that I would be seeing, too, many of the people from her life whom I’ve met. Her friends Laura and Daniela were both in the first video on the disc. I’m not in touch with any of my friends from when I was that age—not even casually. And I had hardly bothered to consider the age difference between Rhonda and her cousin Rikki, who hosted us over the holidays, but there she was, clearly much younger in her goofy rambunctiousness than the 16-year-old Rhonda, who in the same video sat shyly staring downward, as 16-year-olds do. Above all else, I was impressed by how supported it seemed Rhonda has been. This is something she appreciates, and it’s good for me to appreciate it, too. “Family” is an abstract idea to me. My feelings about it are complicated and change frequently. But Rhonda, I think, felt supported in her childhood, and I got to see some evidence of how this might have been so. A dinner at a restaurant at which she and other girls took turns walking around in different outfits, showing what they had learned through a modeling class—hilarious, but also touching. Her mother and stepfather holding an “Oscars” ceremony in the living room, in which all the awards went to the movie that Rhonda and her friends had made with the camcorder. When I think of myself at sixteen, I remember feeling like an adult who was ashamed that he couldn’t function as an adult yet. I had given up on childhood, having found it impossible. I’m glad Rhonda had a different experience. 36 I haven’t been reading lately. I’ve been feeling adrift in time and place, honestly. A two and a half hour commute to Whidbey Island, Washington in the morning, which due to traffic is more like three hours when I drive back to Canada in the afternoon. It was only three days a week until this week, but now I’ve finally started orientation at my second job, in Lynnwood, Washington, and so from now on it’ll be six days a week. The plan is that I’ll stay in AirBnBs a couple of nights a week starting in about a month. These are two permanent part-time positions. I consider this an ideal arrangement, because if I lose one job I will still have the other to provide some income along with access to people who cannot just ignore my text messages when I ask them to be a work reference for me. It is sort of darkly funny that I have always had the ambition of not owning a car. But really, all lives are ridiculous. We should acknowledge that more. It’s only when the ridiculousness is also rare that everyone knows it’s okay to laugh at it. But everyone has their equivalent of driving more than five hours a day to a job in another country, a job at which they don’t even tell anybody they’re doing that commute. Would anything I’d be likely to do with those hours be any less ridiculous? I think they’d be more ridiculous, because they wouldn’t be aimed so squarely at a future that I’ve decided is possible and desirable. 37 Things that I’ve been privately thinking about when it comes to my and Rhonda’s future together have a way of coming out before too long—even if it feels bold to be thinking of those things. It makes sense, though, given our ages, that we’ve been talking about having children, since we’d like to do that, and we’re old to be thinking about doing that. I’ve let her know that I like the idea of us sharing a surname, and that I don’t feel attached to my own except probably as a pen name. She, I, and a hypothetical child could share the last name she has now, Shanks, or her mother’s last name, Bell, or any other name that might sound good to us. We’ve been talking about that. I intentionally didn’t raise the topic after we first broached it, but she has brought it up a couple of times. And the other night we even started discussing baby names. We have a timeline, too, of October of this year as a reasonable time to start trying to conceive. As reasonable as possible: I’ll be thirty-nine years old and she’ll be forty-two. If having a biological child with just anyone was my wish, I could have dated accordingly. But the thought of raising a child with her and giving her the opportunity to parent with someone who loves her and who wishes to do that with her is such a wonderful thought. As it stands, this would still hold very much true if it proved impossible for the child to be our biological offspring. Our parental impulses and our thoughtful, kind natures, working together to be an example of what family can be—let’s make that happen. 38 I still am a broken human when it comes to sleep. At least, I am broken if we presume that my level of brokenness should be defined by how well I meet society’s mandate of pretending that I sleep in a rhythm synchronized to a 24-hour clock. 39 Jan 28, 2020. Maybe there’s just something about the number twenty that I like: I felt overly impressed by the changing of the calendar year when 2000 came around, and now that it’s 2020, I’m excited every day to be alive for this date. 2014? Who cared about being around for a day in that year? But 2020? That sounds interesting! 40 I stayed over at Rhonda’s last night. She’s sick with a cold. I haven’t caught it yet, so I was like, eh, whatever, I want to see her. I still like her apartment; as much as I like my own, I like the view from her window even more than the view from my own. (Mine looks out mostly into other people’s apartments, which I have to be in the mood to ignore in order to not shut the blinds to. ) She’s right across the street from the beach, too, and there’s a bus stop right there. If one of her roommates were planning to move out, I’d just suggest that I move in in their place instead of having her move in with me. The beach right across the street from her is also where I was first charmed by Vancouver, that first time that I visited. I remember walking the paved walkway there, with all the joggers and cyclists going by and with all the geese skulking about and with all the seagulls harassing each other, and I remember thinking, “Well, if I ever lived in Vancouver I’m sure I couldn’t live anywhere near this. ” And then maybe that same night, but definitely sometime on that trip, I went a bar that it turns out is on the same block I’m living on now, and I drank alone and wrote and occasionally glimpsed up at the tennis players on television screens, and when I went to use the washroom the stall was painted red and was completely enclosed, and I felt like I was having a moment of some importance but I couldn’t figure out what the importance was. And a typical work day for me now is fourteen hours long if you include commuting times, and it’s six days a week. And the new year has me reinventing my creative pursuits, as it always does, and Rhonda is feeling down and I text to ask if I should come over again and watch something with her on her couch, and now Sheela is calling. 41 Sheela was calling to talk business. I have recently agreed to be the alternate executor of her living trust—basically to be in charge of the situation in the event that she dies or is incapacitated and the primary executor (Janelle) is unable to do the job. The living trust is something she’s putting in place so that her wishes for Isabella (and the managing of the money she has saved) would have a voice in the event that something happened to her. It’s an unlikely series of tragic events that would lead to me needing to take on this responsibility. But it would be a big responsibility, particularly for someone with no plans to live anywhere near Massachusetts within the foreseeable future. 42 I have made no more progress in my reading. Life becomes a montage, and that is okay. I do what there is to be done. I see more of the sun, then I see less of the sun, then I see the sun again. I get hungry, so I find food, and then I’m less hungry, and then I get hungry again. Rhonda is looking ahead, seems sure that she wants to be one half of a couple with me. She reports that some days are more difficult for her than others. Sometimes it’s very hard for her, and she calls out from work, cancels plans, says she can’t come over or that she would like to come over. She stays over for two or three days at a stretch sometimes, adjusts her strategies for being more productive. Sometimes when she’s vulnerable it’s clear that I say the wrong thing, but as far as I can tell this is not often. More often I seem to say things that are encouraging to her. Being good to her is work, but it’s motivating work, not hard work, and what I’m putting in feels sustainable. The OT training me at the job on Whidbey Island rarely lets me finish a sentence; I come to her with a list of questions about how to document something in the software and it’s hard to get through the list, because she starts to show me something I haven’t asked about instead and then says, “Do you want to work on that a while and then I’ll come back, then?” and I’ll say, “Well, no. I still want to know about this thing. ” Sometimes I feel like the humans I encounter in life are less and less hearing what I’m saying and more and more just responding to key words. I feel like everyone is trying to be the Google search engine, giving me the most popular results, throwing out important parts of questions as if they’re tics or quirks or “um”s or “well”s. I’m doing visits to patients on my own now, there on Whidbey, and then I drive to the parking lot of the hospital in Coupeville and sit in my car in the parking lot, parked toward the back. Deer wander through—I see them walk in a line through the lot most days. It’s raining, just a little, and everything is a dark green and a light gray. I am maybe the second youngest person on the staff of the home health team. No one really knows I live in Canada. They know I have a girlfriend there. Only the other OT has seen that my license plate is from British Columbia. I fear that technically I shouldn’t be able to be working there without a car registered in Washington; I think that’s usually a requirement of the job, so I try to keep my car out of sight. Certainly no one knows that when I show up I’ve been commuting for two and a half hours to get to the job. I never meant for that commute to be a normal, everyday thing, but it makes the most sense for me right now. It’s two in the morning on Thursday, the 6th of February and I’ve only been paid for four days of work since I left for the Christmas trip to Alberta. Biweekly pay periods are annoying. But I have a full paycheck from Whidbey coming in, it should be deposited in the morning, and although I have a backlog of things to spend that money on things should start to feel more steady now and I’ll be able to pay for an AirBnB one or two days a week. Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays I work at the HCR ManorCare in Lynnwood and while I’m there I claim to my co-workers that I’m staying in Everett with a friend during my work week. That job feels more straightforward—no required work meetings, and I don’t feel like an important part of the team. I don’t mind not feeling important—it feels safer that way. On Tuesday, the 4th of February I brought the karaoke machine over to Rhonda’s place and we sat on her couch singing songs. I said to her, “Can you believe we get to be adults and decide what to do with our free time, and no one gets to stop us?” She says that karaoke machine is the best gift anyone has given to her, not because of what it is but because it comes with the permission to sing and to experiment in what she sings. She gets to stretch herself in the way that she’s creative, and I listen and encourage and get into the groove, and then I sing too, and she listens too, and she overstates the quality of my singing voice, and although sometimes she gets unexplainably anxious or down and has to try to center herself with meditation or just sitting quietly, it feels to me like a status quo full of more potential than if we were watching movies instead. Although, we do watch things on our laptops, sometimes. And in fact, after karaoke that night, we watched the series finale of The Good Place, and I said to her, “I wish I had more Bearimies with you,” a reference to the way time passes in the afterlife setting of that series (measured by a “Jeremy Bearimy”). It wasn’t just that I was saying I enjoy spending time with her and want to stay with her; I was also referring to things like what I directly referenced later in the night when I said, “Maybe someday we’ll even finish interviewing each other,” because we’ve slowly been going through the process of asking each other questions about our life stories, one year at a time, and writing down notes in a shared notebook, and this has proceeded at a pace of maybe two to three years of each others’ life each night that we do it. And just overall, in many respects, it isn’t the intensity of my feelings for her that makes me feel like I want to stay with her for the duration of this lifetime; it’s that I’m approaching what commonly is referred to as “middle age” and so have some sense of what one year, ten years, forty years means, and the length of time between now and likely infirmity is something I can wrap my head around, and it feels to me like it’s a good thing we’re getting started now, because there are a few decades’ worth of things that I’d like to try to get around to doing with her. The reason I’m awake at this hour is not that I haven’t gone to sleep—it’s that I went to sleep late in the afternoon yesterday. I’m well rested now. I sit in my 14th floor apartment in the city of Vancouver, I drink coffee, and I write. I wonder what my name will be when I die. 43 I drive from Vancouver to Whidbey Island on the 10th of February, which is the day before Dominic’s thirty-sixth birthday. Scheduling patients is more difficult at this job than at other home health jobs I’ve worked, because we’re told to block our phone numbers and to have patients call the office to confirm times. On this particular day I only end up seeing one person, for their discharge from OT. Fortunately I’m on the clock for more than this, though, since Marcella, the other OT, still has some things to train me on that she had forgotten about. And once all my work has been done I drive down to the south end of the island and take the ferry from Clinton to Mukilteo. I like taking ferries. I like the look and smell of the water. I like movement that doesn’t require me to drive an automobile. Then I keep driving south, first through the Seattle and Tacoma rush hour traffic, then along the comparatively open freeway that gets me to Portland. I stop to fill up on inexpensive calories at the Wendy’s near Chopsticks, then I head into that familiar karaoke spot to join the developing party of Dominic’s friends and co-workers. The night is delightful. Everyone’s songs, all the conversation is delightful. The next night, Bi Bar, is also nice. And the day after that, while Dominic is working, I see 63 Up at Cinema 21, and it seems to me the best of the films in that series, which checks in every seven years on subjects who were initially filmed in the 1960s when they were seven years old. And the night after that I hang out with Dominic on the apartment he will soon be vacating in favor of a place where he will have no roommates, and I let him pick what to watch, and it’s The Great British Baking Show, which I don’t pretend holds any interest for me, but that’s fine, because I want to fall asleep as quickly as possible, since I need to wake up at three in the morning or something to get to work. 44 And a couple of days working on Whidbey Island, now mostly on my own and able to drive home early and document patient visits whenever I want from home. And I clean my apartment on Thursday night and Rhonda comes over on Friday night, and while I work on Saturday and Sunday she is mostly, I think, in bed and depressed, and on Monday it’s the eleventh anniversary of her mother’s death, which she’s allowing to be an intuition day, and she steps out and I stay at home budgeting, still trying to catch up in that regard, and then she agrees to me coming over, which I think might be nice for her, and it seems like it is, and I appreciate listening to audio recordings of conversations she had with her mother a couple of years before her passing, and I appreciate watching the last episode of Friends because that was a show her mother enjoyed, and I comment that to this day I can’t tell Joey and Chandler apart from each other and Phoebe’s the only one I like, and I didn’t realize that the actor Paul Rudd was in that show, and Rhonda wonders when that series ended and she Googles it and it was 2003. And next week I think I’ll start staying at AirBnBs in the States two nights a week, and that’ll help. I’m excited by this 100 Pages project I’ve started, but I haven’t been able to slip into that headspace to work on it as much as I’m counting on being able to do, although I get lost in doing it when I can get started. Rhonda and I have talked about surnames we could both adopt, which a child of ours could then take on. We haven’t talked about this name-changing being connected to marriage—haven’t talked about that outright—but we’ve compared our opinions on different possible names we could both choose to take. We both independently came up with Bellares, although when she mentioned it I couldn’t remember if I had mentioned it or, I think more likely, if I had thought of it but then decided I didn’t love the sound of it, but after she mentioned it I considered it again, and this weekend I had mentioned it again, and on this night I tell her that I’ve been Googling it and it’s not a common name although some people in the Philippines apparently have it, and in Latin it’s the second person active imperfect subjective form of the verb meaning “to wage war”, meaning, if I understand it correctly, “you would be fighting a war”, but in the sense of “would” meaning that the thing definitely did not occur although it could have. With both of us having names meaning or connected to war and violence—“Rhonda” meaning “good with a spear” and “Louise” meaning “warrior” and “Shanks” meaning “stabs”, and “Adam” meaning “man” and “Marcel” meaning “warlike” and “Ares” being the god of war, I like the idea that our new surname might signify a war averted. She types the names into her phone to see how they look: Rhonda Bellares. Adam Bellares. Adam and Rhonda Bellares. She wants to be kind and giving to me. I hope someday I feel secure in my ability to survive without a complex, difficult plan for my moving forward. I know I’m at my maximum possible velocity and that I will need before long to be able to coast at a more comfortable pace. For now I am focused on the positive feelings that come from Rhonda allowing me to be supportive of her. I like that what I give to her helps, and the giving helps me feel real. Too often I have felt unable to do anything for the world except keep myself inspired enough to keep learning enough to keep pace with the challenges of trying to be inspired enough to keep learning enough to keep pace with the challenges of trying to be inspired enough. I’ve always wanted an opportunity to help someone I loved. 45 Feb 27, 2020. Just after midnight. Inside my apartment in Vancouver. I was supposed to stay at an AirBnB outside Bellingham last night, but it turned out none of my patients wanted to be scheduled for today, and they wanted to be seen tomorrow instead. So, there’ll be a pretty long day ahead of me tomorrow, and I need to be up at 5:00 to start it. I plan to get up and shower, then drive the two and a half hours to Whidbey Island, where I’ll meet with the home health director for my sixty day employee evaluation, drive to see four patients, and it will probably be 4:30 in the afternoon when I then drive probably another hour to my hotel room in Everett. Between then and when I work the next morning in Lynnwood I’ll try to fit in about four hours’ worth of documenting time. (Actually, that doesn’t sound so bad by my standards, now that I write it out. ) I find the Internet to be relatively useless for connecting with people at this point. Maybe that will feel different if I do the 100 Pages journal and podcast thing right, as I try editing together and promoting the journals of people who have been dead for over a century. It’s true that I believe diaries are interesting, that civilization in general is failing itself when it spends so little time taking in the available records of how people thought and felt about their own experiences in different times and places. It’s also true that I want to push myself to read diaries more and that I’d love to not be completely alone in doing this. But just as my getting three Master’s degrees was partially me proving to myself that I could reach far off and difficult goals, my drive to promote the importance of diaries certainly has to do with me wanting to feel that the time I’ve spent writing about myself was not all only an act that could ever benefit myself. I felt while I was writing Sunset and Dawn that I had stumbled on something… not undiscovered, but something that had been invalidated over the years. I was working in an art form too radical to be professionalized, but what I was making felt beautiful in ways that surpassed however beautiful I or my thoughts would ever be. "

COVID-19, a novel coronavirus strain, has been in the news, having disrupted life in parts of China and increasingly, despite efforts to slow its spread, in other parts of the world as well. This includes facilities near where I work in Lynnwood, Washington: the first death from the virus in the United States was about two towns over. One of the other therapists used to work there. So, I was a little extra cautious when it came to wiping down things and sanitizing my hands this weekend. From the sound of it, this is a bit like the flu, but possibly with a higher mortality rate for people with existing respiratory problems or immunodeficiencies. Rhonda and I have talked over our plans for the year. This started when she was over the other night, when she asked me if I could give her an outline for what I thought our plans might look like for the next year or so. This was maybe because she knows I like to plan things out, that I used to go so far as to keep a text file specifically outlining my life plans for the coming years. I wrote down a (very messily-written) outline, and when I came back from work the next day she had written her own revision of it in her notebook, and she showed it to me. She didn’t think we could do a road trip to Alberta around her birthday. She was also not sure about going with me to Massachusetts in May. She’s trying to prioritize her dissertation, which she isn’t always convinced she’ll be able to finish at all. Tentatively, the new plan looks something like this. June—we move in together. July—something small for her birthday (I’ve suggested a night or two in Louella Cabin—the place in Sequim, Washington where I recorded music in 2007, then spent multiple days in November and December 2018, then went to with Rhonda for a couple of lovely nights after the holidays this year). Late August—maybe we can fit in a trip to Alberta or Massachusetts. I’m thinking late summer would be a good time for me to be changing jobs, since I will hopefully be able to work as an OT in Canada by this point. That could be helpful for scheduling to have time off. (My thought is that I could get a Monday through Friday job in Vancouver starting this summer, and then I could keep the weekend gig in the States for the duration of the calendar year. ) October—start trying to conceive a child. November—my cousins, the twins Chris and Ken’s 40th birthday get-together in New Orleans. I understand that Rhonda may or may not be able to attend, but I’ll plan to go anyway. We haven’t figured out the holidays yet, but presumably she’ll have time off then, and maybe we’ll make it to Massachusetts, or maybe not. I’m at peace with the uncertainty. 47 Mar 9, 2020. Rhonda leaves in the morning to start her day. Maybe Wednesday or Thursday night I’ll go over to her place. Then as usual she’ll spend the weekend at my place. Also, next Sunday is our rescheduled plan to do dinner with Laura-Lee and Rick. In the news, the spread of COVID-19 continues, and the Democratic Party in the United States is doing an impressive job sabotaging Bernie Sanders before he can win the primary contest. 48 Fact about me: I started the process of trying to get Canada to let me practice as an occupational therapist five years ago. I got my credentials assessed and passed their licensing exam in 2015, but it turned out the provincial organizations wouldn’t register me without a current visa or permanent resident status. I got permanent resident status in 2018, but by then a new, lengthy, amazingly expensive review process was in place, and because I had not been registered in any of the provinces prior to a certain date I had to apply through this process. I started this in August 2019. So far, they have determined through this process that while my American training is NOT substantially equivalent to Canadian training (!) but they will let me proceed through the process to sit for a six-hour interview (?!) in which I will have a chance to prove that I know enough to sit for the licensing exam, which I will not however need to take, because I already passed it in 2015. 49 Mar 12, 2020. Me in 2019: “I feel like nothing I do could ever have much consequence. ” Me in 2020: “There’s almost no traffic at rush hour at the U. S. -Canadian border that I cross every day to work at a nursing home that is currently missing one doctor while he self-isolates because he also worked at a facility with COVID-19 patients. Canadians have been advised to cancel all non-essential travel across the border due to the risk of carrying this virus back from places like the county I work in, where all the local schools have been closed. I think… I should probably sanitize my hands again. ” 50 Mar 17, 2020. Not sure what happens next. Fortunately, as far as I can tell, I’m well, and no one I’ve been in contact with has showed coronavirus symptoms. I can’t keep commuting across the border any longer, though—or at least, given that the rules for commuters like me haven’t been clarified, it would be risky for me to keep trying. So, I’m hiding inside my apartment. Safe, and supported, though uncertain. 51 Mar 21, 2020. The last night out with Rhonda was a good one. Was that two weeks ago, or more recent, or less recent? It came after a couple months of us not really going out; she had a craving for chicken wings and beer from a particular pub, and after we went there and were enjoying our night I suggested we return to the place where we got a karaoke room last year, in the summer or the fall or whenever it was. And it was all totally worth it. I had a sense that this would probably be our last hurrah before the restaurants and bars closed down for… however long they were going to close down for as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. I’m not sure if Rhonda was thinking that also. Then our night with Laura-Lee and Rick, who had prepared us dinner. I arrived with a handout from the border recommending that people returning to Canada self-isolate. (This was the first day any such messaging was communicated at the border; even just a day or two before, the officers were rolling their eyes at British Columbia’s suggestion of the same. ) It was a really nice night of us just sitting around, listening to music, and talking… and the next day was my last time commuting across the border. 52 That was the 16th of March. Things were quickly and clearly moving in the direction of increased border controls. In the morning I waited until the Prime Minister’s speech was over—listened to it on CBC Radio while I was parked in the busy lot of a supermarket in White Rock, listened to be sure no new restriction or hardship would make me regret crossing over into the United States. I went and saw a couple of patients. Then I rescheduled some scheduled visits from Tuesday to later in the week, to buy myself time to think over the situation. 53 I was surprised and touched when both Rhonda and my mom said they hoped I would just stay north of the border and not go down to Washington anymore. It surprised me because… that’s my source of income. And Rhonda and my mom are the people on whom the burden of looking out for me would rest. But they both said I shouldn’t risk it, that I should stay safe and avoid going back to the United States. 54 The thought was in my head all along—since before he became President—that if Trump ever announced a national emergency and closed down the borders, I wanted to be outside of those borders, safe and supported, and I wanted to have no obligation to return to the United States ever again. Even vaguely alluding to these thoughts felt hysterical. But one thing literature reminds a person is that things happen. Read about other places and times, and you’ll see. People live their lives as if there will be no major surprises in the world. But then, again and again, there are surprises. Once in a while a person stays in the same job for their entire adult life, remains comfortably in a home that they purchase when they are young, marries once and forever, and retires at the age they expect to… but calamity is a safer bet. 55 Every night at 7 PM, now, people in the various high-rise apartment buildings of downtown Vancouver stand out on their patios to cheer, clap, and holler in support of the health care workers who are working through this outbreak. Most of them are in pajamas: that’s the new daily uniform for many people all around the world, as they are told to stay home as much as possible. Rhonda has essentially moved into my apartment, at least for the time remaining on my lease (another six weeks). She still has been going back to her place on Beach Avenue twice a week, since she needs the wi-fi for the TA sessions and tutoring she has been doing through teleconferencing. At this point things have only been pleasant for us personally. I’ve been eating and sleeping better than ever. We sing karaoke together every night. We hold each other in bed, making it easy to fall asleep. We reassure each other. We give quick kisses as we pass each other in the kitchen area. 56 Mar 24, 2020. I feel less refreshed than usual after this nap. It takes me a while to roll out of bed. It’s about 10:15 in the morning. Rhonda is on the couch thing, doing work for the class she’s TAing. I walk to the bathroom, check my temperature. About 36 degrees: it reads in Celsius, purchased in Canada. I walk back to the main room, sit down on the couch thing next to Rhonda. “No fever,” I say, “But I’m not feeling great this morning. ” She asks, “What are you feeling?” and I answer, “I don’t know. Something in my nose and throat. Headache, muscle ache, tired. ” “That sounds like what was bothering me last night,” she says, and adds, “Maybe it’s a cold. ” Laura-Lee and Rick are both saying that they have mild colds, too. It’s hard to know what to make of symptoms at a time like this: you’re looking more than usual for something to be wrong, but you’re expecting it to be wrong in a particular way. Today is Tuesday. Usually it’s a schedule of work or other appointments that keeps me oriented to what day of the week it is, but now what’s keeping me aware is the news. In the midst of this pandemic there is more news than usual on the weekend, more press conferences and speeches and statistics… but there is still a bit of a sense of things slowing down on Saturday and Sunday, with the web sites for CBC and CNN, The Globe and Mail and The Washington Post not having quite the same amount of stories to share. And the big policy announcements or votes, those still aren’t likely to happen on a weekend. So today, for example, I know that the Canadian Parliament is meeting to work out the details on an economic relief bill. I don’t know if any of the funds they give out will be available for me, given all the weird specifics of my situation. I also don’t know if it’s likely I’ll qualify for any relief that might be forthcoming for Americans (once it’s determined which plutocrats need to paid off at the same time). I also don’t know if maybe I’ll even qualify for plain old Washington state unemployment insurance benefits. I’m trying not to worry about too many different things on any given day. Sunday I focused on getting my resumé reworked and some variations on a cover letter written, then applied to some jobs. Monday I continued applying to jobs, and I made sure Sunset and Dawn was well copyedited in its current form and ordered a full paperback set of the volumes to be printed and shipped to me. Today I’m writing here again, and I’ll probably try to get some reading done also. When I know more about the financial assistance that I may or may not qualify for, that’ll tell me more about what I should expect in the near term. I got a call early in the morning yesterday from a local health system needing people to stand outside their hospitals and such, directing people to wash their hands and stand apart from each other and all that. But the person on the phone asked if I had been outside Canada in the past fourteen days and when I said it had been one week she said she wouldn’t be able to proceed any further with me as a candidate. I asked if I could email her in a week and she said yes. But of course, they might not need anybody in a week. Other job openings I’ve been seeing are often at grocery stores. I’ve tried applying to those, but I expect I have competition from lots of people with more specific and recent experience who have been laid off from other types of retail and service jobs recently. I already got one rejection by email for an application to Whole Foods. I don’t know. I guess I’ll probably do some job hunting again today, too. But only when I feel like it isn’t going to stress me out. I feel like overall I’ll be more productive that way, and I’ll be a more supportive presence for Rhonda that way, too. 57 The Home Health Director from WhidbeyHealth calls me again. Last time she was telling me that she had terminated my employment, and she seemed to blame me for my not being able to cross the border casually. This time, as she tells me what to do with the work computer and phone (I am to ship it back with the understanding that I will be reimbursed for the cost), she’s being more kind. She sounds, unsurprisingly, overwhelmed by what is happening down there: “There are,” she says, “I think now fifty cases on the island, and three deaths. ” Last week, if I remember correctly, word was that there were two, possibly three cases on the island, and no deaths. “I hope things don’t get too much worse down there,” I say. “Well, thank you,” she says, “But all the indicators seem to suggest that this is just the very beginning. Beginning today we have five hospice staff self-isolating because of exposure at an assisted living facility. ” President Trump, meanwhile, seems to be turning another corner in his response to this thing: he was irresponsible and dismissive of the threat at first, then for about a week he was talking about it with the seriousness that most world leaders and all non-sociopaths have shown it… now it sounds like he… wants to… you know what? I’ve analyzed American politicians as much as I ever need to. They’re monsters representing a population of abused pit bulls. Forget it. 58 Mar 25, 2020. Just after midnight. This may be the first time I’ve tried to go to sleep next to Rhonda but have had to say, “I think I’m too awake; I’m going to head into the other room. ” My sleep has been fairly stable, but with some early waking followed by naps these past couple of days. 59 Mar 26, 2020. I’ve been talking to my mom more often than usual, checking in to see how everyone’s doing out there. I’ve been transitioning to a full-time-Canada-dwelling lifestyle, including getting a local phone number. I also am getting the apartment set up with Internet, even if it’s only going to be for a month. 60 Yesterday, after she came back from working out of her apartment on Beach Avenue, Rhonda had updates about what our living situation might look like by the first of May. She had told me previously (before the pandemic) that Evan had responded positively to the idea of my moving in if the other roommate, Allie, were to move out. Now, apparently, Allie is looking to move out, and as soon as possible. Me moving in there feels like it would be a better outcome than if Rhonda and I had to move in with Laura-Lee and Rick. “One of the things I like about the place I have now,” Rhonda said, “Is that the roommates have usually either not been home a lot of they’ve been shut inside their room. ” But she didn’t seem excited as she talked about the news. She confirmed later in the day that it’s finally starting to have an effect on her how quickly things are changing. Things have gone so smoothly for us in the past week that she has been able to just go with it, but then it occurs to her how much her and my plans are changing in response to world events, and there’s a lot to process there. After nightfall we “interviewed” each other some more—we’re still learning about each other’s life histories, currently listening to and talking about stories now from the late aughties. "

    "body": "61 Mar 29, 2020. Today is the last full day of the 14 day self-isolation period I was told I should go into the last time I crossed the border. I wasn’t even sure, on day one, that they really wanted me to do what they wanted me to do—it seemed extreme, and the attitude even of the people working the border seemed to be that I should just take it as advice to keep in mind, that it wasn’t really an imperative. But now there are so many places, including in North America, where everyone has been told to stay inside and to only go out for essential purposes, that it no longer feels weird. River, in New York, is alone in their apartment with a stockpile of food—their roommates have all fled the city, where the infection rate has quickly surpassed that of places like Washington state and become the new epicentre of the outbreak in the United States—and they haven’t been outside at all for a week now. I expected that tomorrow I would be able to pick up an order of food and sundries from the London Drugs at Granville and Georgia. I paid for the order, and it was picked and set aside… but then (as I happened to read on the web site for The Vancouver Sun) the location was closed suddenly because of an employee’s testing positive for COVID-19. Rhonda says grocery shopping has become quite an awkward situation, at least at the Nester’s Market on the corner, which is fairly small and sometimes difficult to navigate even when a 2 metre distance between all shoppers is not being requested. I also placed an order to pick up groceries at a Real Canadian Superstore on the nearest date I could find a time slot there—a week and a half from now. Two weeks ago I was worried for what my financial situation would look like after I stopped working. Now, though, it appears I might be okay, and that in the short term my income might even see an increase, given the federal funds being added to state unemployment insurance payouts now. I’ve applied for UI benefits in the state of Washington, and so far it seems like I qualify. (Fingers crossed until I actually see the money, of course. ) Evan, Rhonda’s roommate, doesn’t actually want to live with a couple, so it looks like Rhonda and I will just be staying here, at my place on Seymour Street, at least for now. I can choose a month-to-month agreement now that the lease here is ending, and that will keep things flexible for if we need to move somewhere less expensive. But we’ve been managing well here for the past couple of weeks, and this was something we already had thought we might be moving toward. It feels comfortable. And if we can be comfortable in a time like this, we are fortunate indeed. I was trying again to get my laptop to recognize my external DVD-ROM drive, so that I might burn some CDs… or something? Because I would like to have a music collection that I can hold onto, because I don’t want to have to trust that I’ll have access to streaming services and that streaming services will have the music I’ll want to listen to for the rest of my existence. In trying to get my computer in better shape I thoughtlessly deleted all my applications, though… and until I have Internet service hooked up I don’t have a way to download the word processing software I’ve been using for the 100 Pages issues, or the audio editing software I need to edit podcasts. I hope the modem or whatever arrives in the mail tomorrow. For now, I suppose it’s a good day to get back to reading, to see if I can remember who any of the characters in Patricia Grace’s Cousins are. 62 Mar 30, 2020. No longer under instructions to stay inside, my first destination of the day (after bringing trash and recyclables to the area that is designated for such things) is the leasing office for my building. I bring the papers that are meant for me to sign regarding whether I want to renew the lease, switch to a month to month rental, or vacate. I say that I want to switch to a month to month rental, but that I’m not sure, given the freeze that has been placed on rent increases, whether I should sign the now-outdated papers, which mention a rent increase, or whether they want to modify them first to make the rent amounts correct, or what. She says yeah just sign this one, so I sign it. I also ask about adding my girlfriend as a resident, but she says they aren’t concerned with things like that right now, that I can check in about it in a few months if I want. Outside, on the sidewalks of downtown Vancouver, people are generally quite good about keeping the advised two metres’ distance from each other. The pedestrian traffic has been reduced quite a bit, which makes it not impossible to follow this guideline. On Granville Street the scene feels particularly spooky, because while the crowds of shoppers, restaurant-goers, and bar-goers has dissipated there are still the same amount of people lying down on cardboard, or limping along asking strangers for coins, or shouting at no one in particular. The London Drugs location that was closed yesterday has already been cleaned or whatever and reopened for business, so I’m able to pick up my order there. When I get back to the apartment Rhonda is in bed, napping, and doesn’t stir. I come in with the things I got from London Drugs, plus some additional items (tofu, Korean pancakes for Rhonda, and my new favourite toothpaste, which is a Korean brand) from H Mart. After putting things away I head right back out, to the Nester’s Market that’s just a few doors down, and I do a shopping trip there. Rhonda is still motionless in bed when I’m done putting things away. My guess is that it would feel like a burden on her if I engaged her directly, so instead I plug in the karaoke machine and sing songs she has said she likes hearing me sing. When that’s over I’m sitting on the “Thing” (the sofa-ish thing) and she’s still in bed, but she starts saying that she’s ready to get up and she asks if I could drive her to pick up a few things at her place, because the contact lenses she brought with her are hurting her eyes when she tries to put them in, et cetera. I say sure, and with my phone still synced to the speaker I play upbeat ’90s songs, Beastie Boys and Destiny’s Child, and I follow her into the bathroom where she’s changing clothes and brushing her teeth. I sit with the car in the driveway in front of her Beach Avenue apartment building, while she goes upstairs. I’ve been checking the online portal for my Washington state unemployment insurance claim over and over, and it seems now that there’s a delay, that they’re looking into it to see if I qualify, so I’m not getting paid right away, and I don’t know when I’ll know whether I’ll be getting benefits from them. I might be able to collect the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) once that’s up and running, but there’s no way to know yet. Rhonda comes back down from her apartment, wearing her glasses (which I’ve seen her in before but not too often). She asks if I would stop near a convenience store so she can stock up on the Drumstick ice cream cones she loves so much. Yum—I like those things, too. Back at my/our place on Seymour Street—let’s refer to it by the apartment name, Metropolitan Towers, since it’s fun to be ostentatious—I call up Shaw, the company I’ve purchased Internet service through, to ask about the status of my order. (My first call was disconnected right after I gave my debit card details; I was promised an email with order details each of the three following times I called, but I never received anything. ) My modem has arrived at the London Drugs at Granville and Georgia, I’m told. What? I laugh. That’s where I just was earlier in the day. It looks like there’s a post office in there, the person on the phone says. Yes, there is, I say, but I don’t know why my package would be there instead of inside my building, where it usually is. I’ve had mail delivered to my building as recently as Friday, and today is Monday. Rhonda is about to take a shower. I tell her I probably won’t be here when she gets back, because I have to go back to London Drugs. When I lived in the United States, I figured life in Canada would mean hanging out in Tim Horton’s all the time. No: life in Canada means hanging out in London Drugs all the time. I get the modem, head back to Metropolitan Towers, and make a phone call to set it up. Rhonda is staring at sheets of paper, trying to plan out her next few days (see how alike the two of us are???), and I’m using the speedy Internet to update my contact information on different sites, since I plan to drop my New York number and switch to using my Vancouver number within the week. We take a break to watch fifteen minutes of stand-up comedy, then work separately a little bit more. Eating presumably happens at some point. (I’ve been doing most of the cooking. ) Then we have our usual sixty-ish minutes of karaoke. After that she wants us to read to each other. She has a story to read by Pauline Melville—actually, she reads half of it aloud and then I read the second half. And I read a story, “Terror,” by Junichiro Tanizaki. Then she wants to go to bed, but I stay up forever. 63 Apr 2, 2020. 1 AM. I’m in the little room, which is a nice hideaway both Rhonda and I have taken advantage of in our time here. Rhonda’s asleep; our schedules have deviated. I follow the news more than Rhonda does. Which is not to suggest that I obsess over it or anything—on the contrary, I like to stay apprised of what’s going on so that I’m less often surprised, so that world events take up less bandwidth even when they’re dire or lamentable. I’m in the little room, which has a twin mattress on the floor, and a pillow, and a sheet, and a comforter. Rhonda usually only spends time in here when she has a phone call to make, or when she video conferences for the classes she teaches. Otherwise, if she’s just working on her dissertation or whatever, it sounds like she worries that the lure of the bed will be too much for her. I don’t know what’s going to happen with my income, but I at least figured out that I’ll be okay for a while even if I don’t get government support from either the U. S. or Canada. I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me enough that they will probably not leave me to die in the street. Rhonda is aware that I’m ready to start trying to make a baby whenever she is. She has a lot to think about, and she’s not going to rush herself. But, wow: it’s true. I’m ready. 64 Apr 4, 2020. Rhonda has spent a lot of the past two days hiding away in the little room. It makes me a little bit nervous all day, because I never know when the door will open and it will be time for us to be hanging out again. River, in New York City, says they know personally about fifteen people who are currently sick with COVID-19. I told this to Rhonda so she’d understand my reticence about her going downstairs to Nester’s Market for ice cream. On Thursday she borrowed the car, wanting to get out, and I was supportive of this but also expressed concern about her potentially needing to stop somewhere to use a washroom—which she did, at a Real Canadian Superstore. She came back with some groceries, and I said, “That must have been nice, being able to drive around a bit. Maybe we should try to do that—plan for, like, one of us to do a grocery trip once a week, and when we do that we can make a point of driving somewhere to do it. ” But she was saying she was pretty sure it was still okay to go out almost like normal so long as everyone’s staying two metres apart. But my mind is in America right now—in NYC, for example, people are being told that they should wear an improvised mask when they go outdoors. 65 So, yeah, it was sort of new that she was hiding out in the little room. When she came out to the main area of the apartment it was for bedtime. Although she had less to say than usual she was just as warm, seemed just as happy walking up behind me while I sat on the Thing and putting her arms around me. I asked if we could talk briefly before sleep, if she could reassure me a little. She agreed, and that went well. I told her I figured everything was okay but that I wanted to hear her say it if I could. And in fact, after that quick process of reassuring me was done, she kept wanting to talk while we lay in bed and waited for my liquid melatonin to kick in and put me to sleep. She said she had spent some of the day thinking about our plans, about the timeline for our trying to conceive. “I may need another month to think about it,” she said, “But I’m starting to feel like I might be ready to stop using condoms. Like, within the next few days. ” I squeezed her and said I just wanted her to be sure she was only taking that step when she was comfortable taking it. She said she knew. It seems we have the baby names picked out. 66 Apr 8, 2020. I’ve been trying to get my and Rhonda’s sleep schedules more in sync by taking melatonin as needed at around midnight and setting an alarm to wake us up around eight hours after we get to sleep. It feels like this has helpful in keeping the two of us more happy and productive. 67 We’ll always remember, I think, how nice these weeks have been for us. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,” I said to her as we lay together. 68 She’s pretty sure she’s ovulating. We’re giving ourselves time to process what we’re doing by going through the last four condoms. The expectation is that on or around my birthday (which is two weeks from today) we’ll be out of condoms and will start trying to make a baby. 69 Apr 10, 2020. Yesterday I had an order of groceries to pick up at a Superstore in Burnaby, while Rhonda wanted to spend the day at her apartment getting some things together to move. It was a small batch of stuff that she brought down to the car at the end of the day, but the inclusion of a nightstand was enough to inspire us to change the orientation of the bed, which allowed us to reimagine what we should be keeping in the closet, which led to other corners of the place being tidied up and organized. My purchases at the Superstore had included an electric kettle (finally—I had been using a pot on the stove to heat the water for my coffee and tea, and because of my pouring the water out all the time there was a near-constant puddle atop the range). A new pot, too, since the lid to my other one fell and shattered a few days ago. And a new pizza pan—not just for pizza but for other things being heated in the oven, like fish fillets and chicken tenders—to replace the existing pizza pan, which has become all blackened and stuff. With luck maybe now the smoke alarm won’t go off so frequently. Anyway… I liked how it felt to be setting the place up for us. I took some snapshots of her sitting on the floor, making and moving piles of her belongings. We’ve effectively been living together since St. Patrick’s Day, but it’s been more like her staying in my apartment than the two of us staying together in our apartment. So, last night felt like another new beginning for us. She mentioned, actually, last night, how many different new beginnings and anniversaries we have. We were holding hands while sitting next to each other on the Thing, and she said, “I like holding hands with you. ” And I said, “I remember holding hands with you on my birthday last year. ” (That had been the first time—she had taken my hand while the two of us walked back to my car from Deep Cove Park. ) I added that my birthday, then, was an anniversary of a sort for us. “Yeah,” she said, “And July, too, especially, when I got back from my deep dive. ” “Right,” I said. “That was when it became clear what we were doing. ” After those two months of her working on her dissertation without social distraction, not seeing anyone, not talking on the phone or texting, we hit the ground running, grew closer, and were clearly Together before long. There’s no particular date from that month for us to celebrate, though. So, I like acknowledging that January 30 was when we had our first date and also that April 22, my birthday, was when we first held hands, and when I first felt confirmation that she was willing to be romantic with me. (It was before that date that she had kissed me for the first time—on Apr 11, after we saw AJJ play at the Biltmore—but that was a quick thing, done after drinking a couple of beers. I felt more more safe getting excited about the hand-holding, which was done soberly in the afternoon after a long conversation. ) (I also remember vividly her kissing me on the cheek for the first time, in my car, as I dropped her off at her apartment building. She doesn’t remember that. ) But anyway, yeah. My birthday has disappointed me a lot over the years. I wouldn’t mind being able to think of it as an anniversary instead. "

    "body": "70 I’m getting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. The first of the four monthly $2000 CAD direct deposits that I’ll qualify for (so long as I remain unemployed) was deposited this week. I’ll also be getting the $1200 USD stimulus, although that’s just a one-time thing. I don’t know yet about the Washington state unemployment insurance: they’re investigating my claim to see whether they’ll approve me. If they approve me I’ll want to try harder to find work, because if I accept something that’s casual or part-time they’ll just subtract my earnings from my benefits. On the Canadian side, meanwhile, if I have any employment income at all I’ll stop qualifying for the benefit, so if I will not be getting unemployment insurance from Washington I will have to make sure I don’t accept a job that it would cost me thousands of dollars to work. 71 Apr 11, 2020. From our kitchen Rhonda participates in a Zoom event that Laura-Lee is having for her birthday. That’s just who Laura-Lee is, I’m learning: teaching friends and family how to make their own pudding is entirely in character, given that her birthday has to be a socially distant one this year. 72 I’m used to saying “Zoom meeting”, but I suppose “Zoom event” is more appropriate now that it’s normal to use that videoconferencing software for non-business purposes as well. 73 River is starting volunteer work driving doctors around New York City in a van. It sounds like there’s an ongoing need for this, giving the desperate state of the COVID-19 situation there and the number of doctors who are willing to work there but who are unfamiliar with and unwilling to drive around the city.  River: It just feels like the right thing to do. Im not really telling anyone about it until it is over bc I dont want folks to worry. River: Haha. Apparently it is OK if you worry. 74 I’m shaving my face with about the same frequency I have been shaving it this past year. I was more inclined to wear facial hair between the years of, oh, I guess it was 2016-2019? (I feel like my beard was a new thing still when I moved to New York, although I might be wrong. ) Now I’m shaving it completely but only once a week or so. When I was doing my various cross-border commutes I wanted to shave more but was often too tired to do it. Now that I’m at home almost all the time I just don’t care as much what I look like, so I don’t bother to shave until it feels itchy to me. But, yeah. That’s what I’m doing—shaving in the bathroom—for most of the duration of the Zoom event that Rhonda is participating in for Laura-Lee’s birthday. 75 Then I shower. Then Rhonda is heading out for some groceries. Once Rhonda is out the door I pull my guitar out from under the Thing. It’s a clear day outside. Through the window of my apartment, in the distance, in the places where the other apartment buildings aren’t blocking the view, I can see the mountains. The snow caps decrease day by day as time pushes us into Spring. Oh, heck, that’s right—it’s Easter weekend. For the podcast piece of my 100 Pages project I’m looking to fill up time with things that are not just me reading the text of old journals. The conversations I recorded with Rhonda turned out good, but I feel like I can only talk about so much, and Rhonda has more than enough to read as it is without feeling like she should be doing free labour for me, reading all my issues of this as I put them together. So, I’m thinking, maybe I can write some silly songs about the different diarists? Nah. I don’t get any farther than just tuning the guitar. I would worry too much about the appropriateness of trying to turn the lives of real people into silly songs. Even if the people have been dead for a hundred years or longer, I wouldn’t want to be disrespectful. And that worry about appropriateness would turn the idea of writing silly songs (like what I did for Songs of Anatomy and Physiology) into something more serious, difficult, and time-consuming. I wouldn’t be able to just go with whatever musical or lyrical idea entered my head. So, no. I’ll try to speak with spoken content. Even if I have to start preparing by way of notes, if I have to do a lecture sort of thing as part of the podcast, the stakes are low, and it’s good practice for any teaching that I might want to do at some point in my life. I call Sheela. I’ve tried calling a few times since the pandemic started disrupting life in North America, but she didn’t answer before today. It sounds like she had the virus and is now mostly recovered. No symptoms in Isabella, and none in Chris, none in his family, but Sheela for a while there wasn’t able to even walk household distances without feeling winded. In the middle of my phone call with Sheela the door unlocks and opens—Rhonda forgot to take her wallet with her when she went to the store. She looks overwhelmed. I don’t talk to Sheela about my future plans with Rhonda—not really. I just say that she has moved in and that things have been good. I’m still on the phone when Rhonda gets back with the groceries. I offer to put everything away and she says sure. She goes in the little room to talk with Laura-Lee. No. Wait. I have the order of things confused in my brain. The pudding-making over Zoom happened after everything else. But, yeah. Rhonda also said that she wasn’t doing well, that she might need to be a little distant to take care of herself. I’m glad she’s usually able to express her needs, to help me respect her boundaries, to make clear what I should and shouldn’t be worrying about regarding her feelings. 76 I drive to what is still Rhonda’s apartment building until the end of the month. I drop her off. Turn off the ignition there in the driveway thingie. Wait for a while. It’s stressful because I have to keep watch for cars behind me that might want me to get out of their way if they need to get through. Eventually Rhonda comes back down, with her gifts for Laura-Lee’s birthday wrapped up and with a few other things for our apartment, too. We drive to Laura-Lee and Rick’s place, where we stand two metres away from the entrance to the door. Rhonda sets down the bag of gifts then steps back. We chat a bit. Laura-Lee gives us cake on what she assures us are well sanitized plates with well sanitized forks. At 7:00 PM we lead the neighbourhood’s clapping and yelling in appreciation of essential workers. 77 Back at the apartment that night the two of us sit on the floor, set up Rhonda’s laptop on the chair, and watch a movie. It takes a while for us to pick something on Netflix—I’m astonished at how difficult it is these days to find anything I would want to watch, and I find myself really missing the days of Netflix DVDs being sent through the mail, if not the days of needing to walk to a video rental store (when at least the old classics were available, even if the new releases of the time didn’t happen to be very interesting). But I end up suggesting Don’t Think Twice, directed by Mike Birbiglia, and that turns out to be pretty good. 78 She has set up a diffuser for essential oils next to the bed. Along with heating the oils to make the room smell nice the diffuser casts light in our choice of colour. I like what it adds to the newly rearranged bed-corner of the apartment from its place on the nightstand. As we cuddle up together at the end of the night she says to me, “I really think that in the future, when I look back, I’m going to think of these as some of the best days of my life. ” 79 Apr 12, 2020. I’m up about ninety minutes before Rhonda. In general I require a bit less sleep than she does. She streams her yoga class. I put on socks and a sweater and move the chair out to the balcony, where I can read and write. I’m finally getting back to reading Cousins, while I’m also reading through the hard copy of Sunset and Dawn (in its six-volume form) that arrived the other day. It’s true that I’m wearing sweatpants this morning, but I don’t always. I try to vary my clothing choices: sometimes I spend the day in full pajama mode, while other times I wear one of my long skirts because why not, or I’ll wear what I would have worn on a typical day before the pandemic. 80 I see Rhonda submitting her resume to a teaching job. I sing a silly song about it, for no reason except that I am a ridiculous person. On a more serious note, I then say to her, “Once I know more about my unemployment insurance situation, I think I want to look at teaching and tutoring jobs. Because if I ever want to do that sort of thing in the future, I’ll be competing with a lot of people who got their experience teaching remotely while all of this was going down. Now might be a good time to get in, when I’m not alone in having to learn. ” 81 Oh, that’s right—it’s Easter. 82 Apr 14, 2020. Oh, that’s right—it was Easter. 83 Apr 20, 2020. Oh, that’s right—it was the week after Easter.  Odd that I suddenly went a full week without being moved to write anything, but that’s the nature of the way I write about my life: it’s inconsistent, and I let it be so. My days have, how shall I put this? Sometimes involved me feeling less than fully capable of meeting my productive potential. There have been days when I knew I wanted to get particular things done, like applying for jobs or working on 100 Pages, but I wouldn’t be able to focus, and if I did finally focus the slightest thing would pull me out irreversibly. But I’ve always had days like that. Those are mostly the days when I’ve gone to sleep and woken up at normal human hours, and especially if I’ve been doing that for multiple days in a row. My cognition suffers when too much of my awake time is spent in the daylight; I don’t know what’s up with that. But, yeah, I’ve also been wrapping my head around what Rhonda and I are doing together. During one of her regular phone calls with Laura-Lee the other day she talked about how the two of us will be “trying to conceive” beginning this Wednesday. As much as I have thought all of this through, it was still strange to hear it said aloud that I and Rhonda are “trying to conceive”. That is one of those things I still feel a person like me isn’t supposed to get to go through, even as we navigate a world that pretends everybody does. The new Fiona Apple album, Fetch the Bolt Cutters, came out the other day and has been constantly in my ears. 84 I have a job interview in Burnaby. “Are you nervous about the interview?” Rhonda asks me before it happens, and I reply, “No,” because I’m not. It helps that it feels low-stakes: the safest way things could go right now, all things considered, would probably be for me not to get a job, for me to just sit tight until I see how much assistance I get from what governments under what conditions. (Still waiting on my Washington unemployment insurance claim. ) Also, in recent years I’ve done pretty well at job interviews. This one doesn’t go well, though. It’s hard to say why. It’s for a position working at a hotel that’s being used to house people who might normally stay in shelters but who have COVID-19 or are impacted by it? But also the job might involve working at established shelters unrelated to the pandemic. And it’s not clear that the COVID-19 situation is even going to get any worse here in British Columbia, although it’s getting devastating down in the States and is a little less controlled in other Canadian provinces. The hiring manager I’m interviewing with doesn’t seem invested in the process, doesn’t have much in the way of answers to the questions I ask, and seems to have less than zero interest in my experience as a therapist. Any mention made of COVID precautions tends to be a vague reference to how precautions aren’t taken—“Harm reduction as an approach sort of applies to a lot of things we’re doing” et cetera. I leave the organization’s office thoroughly unconvinced that the human service needs of Burnaby are in capable hands. I’m steeped, moreoever, in that yucky feeling one gets after a prolonged experience of being disliked. I’m surprised when I get a follow-up email asking me for reference phone numbers. I reply back the next morning that I have some questions about the hiring needs and process and wonder if I could have a phone conversation, but the person who replies says that it’s a hectic day and she could try to answer by email instead if that works. The red flags are all I can see anymore at that point, so I don’t communicate with them any further. 85 Then it’s the eve of my birthday. With the state of the world being what it is, this day will need to be spent inside. The options that could exist outside of the apartment would be low-romance, and arguably irresponsible to indulge in. But, secretly, I have big plans for what will happen after midnight. 86 Rhonda has her last day of grading for the course she has been TAing. When she’s finished with that, she explains to me her plans for the rest of the afternoon and early evening: she’s going to shower, then go downstairs for some groceries and some drinks from the liquor store. Then she’ll come upstairs and my birthday celebration can begin. We’ve talked about getting food delivered—something we haven’t done yet since COVID hit—and I’ve suggested Denny’s for reasons that are partially nostalgic and partially out of an appetite for irony. I paint my nails a glittery pink for the proposal. "

    "body": "87 Ordering food from Denny’s online is a fiasco. Both my and Rhonda’s credit cards are charged multiple times, then refunded multiple times, but refunded for different amounts than originally charged. The employee I reach by telephone says that the order is ready for pickup, although it was ordered as a delivery. When I say that I ordered a delivery, he says he doesn’t know what the problem is, but that no one is coming to pick up the food to deliver it to me. He says he doesn’t know anything about the third party through which the order had been placed. I hadn’t even realized there was a third party, having ordered directed from the Denny’s web site. Oh, well. We humans are bumbling morons who mess things up constantly. We rarely really know what we’re doing. And in the context of this twenty-first century computer-driven market economy, even human levels of competence are an unrealistic expectation. Ergo, the tragic slapstick of now. But genres are nesting dolls in the real world, and in tragedy there’s comedy, and in both there is romance, and after Rhonda and I have eaten this unhealthy food that is so familiar to me from many nights (usually during hours when other restaurants would be closed) dining in Denny’s locations across the United States—and occasionally, in more recent times, here in Canada—I ask her if she’ll read me something, and she seems immediately to know what she wants to read. I don’t know that what she’ll read will be something she wrote for me, but it is. She has told me on various occasions about the letter she started writing to me last summer, as the two of us were getting to know each other and as the possibility of romance seemed to be developing. She has even read me parts of it. But on this night, as both of us remain conscious of the clock that is approaching midnight (and so April 22, 2020, my thirty-ninth birthday), she reads me the letter in its entirely, which includes things written from very different points in the year 2019. At fifteen minutes before midnight an alarm goes off on her phone. “I’ll be back,” she says. “I’m going into the little room to get something ready. I’ll see you soon! You have fifteen minutes. ” This is actually convenient for me, as it means that I don’t even have to fake needing to use the washroom. When she has closed the door to the little room I just stand up from the Thing, walk over to the washroom, close the door to secure my privacy, reach under the sink and into the toiletries bag there, grab the box that has the engagement ring inside it, and slide the box into my pocket. At the stroke of midnight she walks out of the little room singing “The Birthday Song”. She has taken my pink plastic wine glass, filled it wish small marshmallows and sour gummi worms and some other candies, and topped it with candles spelling out the word “HAPPY”. As she walks through the kitchen, three of the candles go out. “Ohh, thank you!” I say. “Well, there are still two candles you can blow out!” she says. But I grab the cup and say, “I’m worried about the smoke detector. ” I take it into the washroom and blow the candles out there. She laughs at what’s happening while I say, “Oh, no… there’s wax on the candy. I don’t know how much of it to throw out to be safe. ” I throw out a lot of it. The thought of candle wax blending into the colours of already candle-wax-looking candies prevents me from having too much desire for the sweets. Thanks anyway, Rhonda! Then we’re back on the Thing. I’m worried at first that the awkward outcome of her birthday gesture has thrown her off, but soon enough her hands don’t seem to be shaking anymore and we’re both paying attention to the nice, romantic, excited thoughts she was having between our dates all those months back. “And that’s it!” she says after reading the last part of her letter. I scoot next to her and we hug. “That was so sweet. Can we stand up and hug?” “Sure!” I figured she would not be surprised when I asked her this, as I am a generally very random person. So we standing together and hugging. I say, “I’m impressed at how easy a decision this has been. And when I say that, I mean it’s an easy decision to start trying to make a baby with you. And this was an easy decision, too…” I get down on one knee. I reach into my pocket. I pull open a small box. I flip open the box to show her the engagement ring. “Will you marry me, Rhonda?” She says things like “Yes” and “Of course” and “I’ve known for a long time that I wanted to marry you. ” Was I supposed to put the ring on her finger? I guess I forgot to look into some of the steps involved in a traditional marriage proposal. But I wasn’t confident in the ring, wasn’t confident that she would want it. She had mentioned in passing at one point that she worried about the sourcing of diamonds and the ethics of buying them, so I had gone with a lab-grown diamond in a white gold ring. But she still might not like the ring. So I wanted to be sure I explained that the ring could be returned if she wanted, that we could put the money toward something else related to the building of a life together. She just has me stand up, then, and pulls me in for a long hug while continuing to say in a variety of different ways that yes she will marry me. Then we’re sitting back down on the couch and she is saying what a surprise it is. I say that yeah, I sort of hate my birthday, and I liked the idea that I could do something that would make it a kind of anniversary instead, something for the both of us, so it wasn’t supposed to be one-sided with her doing special things for me and whatever. She still hasn’t looked at the ring. I told her it was lab-grown. That’s good, though, I guess: that’s not the important thing. We have a lot to talk about, all the things that have been going through my mind for a long time now as I’ve thought through what we might do for a wedding, although the pandemic has thrown extra uncertainty onto those ideas. I didn’t tell anyone that I was going to propose. Didn’t tell anyone that I was thinking of proposing. Rhonda says she thought I was going to do it, thought I wanted to make it a surprise, but wasn’t expecting it so soon at all, and certainly not on my birthday. My original timeline didn’t have me proposing so early, although I’ve been thinking about how it would fit into our plans for a long time now. I tell her about how even when I would write down ideas for timelines for how our relationship might progress I would write them in code, for superstitious reasons. Interesting how sometimes I put life plans in writing for the magic I imagine doing so will work; then, at other times, I avoid putting plans in writing in an attempt to keep them stowed away. I remember one of the first nights when I was staying in Osoyoos while working in Omak and Brewster—it was before I moved into that long-term AirBnB where I spent most of the duration of that contract—and I was at a motel, and I spent a long night sitting on the floor with my phone and my light blue 2019/2020 planner purchased from Barnes &amp; Noble, figuring out when, if things continued to go well with Rhonda, we might move in together if she wanted that to happen, and when I might propose, and when we might get married, and when we might start trying to conceive a child. Am I remembering that occasion correctly, or am I thinking of even earlier, during one of the long nights I spent sitting on the floor of the Motel Puyallup with that same planner, during my time spent working in Tacoma? It doesn’t matter. I bounced between so many different places these past two years, since I drove away from New York City, and I still remember a lot of the details of where I was when and for how long but pre-COVID it was like I never had the time to really reflect on those specifics so it would take a long time thinking about it to remember, but now that daily life has become the polar opposite and I have been staying in same apartment and not even stepping outside most days I’m able to sort of laminate those experiences, finally, and set them in an organized fashion inside the scrapbook of my memory. Which, speaking of scrapbooks, a scrapbook is exactly what Rhonda got up and ran back to the little room to get, when it still probably just ten minutes after I popped the question to her. I don’t love the phrase “popped the question”, but after a certain age, for a participant in a society, independence is best utilized as a mode of function rather than a pre-requisite of it, so I’m turning into a middle aged loser and that’s just how it has to be. I am engaged! The plan that Rhonda and I both have and are anticipating being publicly open about is for us to be in all legal ways joined together as a couple, as family, as Rhonda Louise Bellares and Adam Marcel Bellares! And the scrapbook is something I gave to her for Christmas, and she has started drawing on the first page, in stylized letters coming together in a circle, the words “LIFE TOGETHER” and the names “Adam Marcel” and “Rhonda Louise” inside the circle. The page also makes a reference to “Our neverending story”, which is sweet. It’s her favourite movie from her childhood, and we just watched it together the other night. I had seen bits of it over the years, and I probably had watched it all the way through at some point in my life, but it wasn’t a move I remembered well. We were glad to see that it holds up, that unlike many movies it still can be enjoyed thirty-six years after its release. When she first starts talking about and then goes to get the scrapbook, though, I feel nervous, because I just proposed to her and we’re starting to talk about it and I still don’t really know how she feels about the ring and is she changing the subject because she’s nervous? It just seems weird. But when she comes back and shows that those are the words she has written into the scrapbook, I get that she’s trying to show me the echo of my sentiment, the statement of commitment and excitement about a future together. Time passes, and we sleep and wake up, and it’s still my birthday. I’ve suggested that we take our time and not tell anyone right away, that we give ourselves as much time during the day as we need to process the news and to figure out the answers to questions that people will undoubtedly have about when and where and how. (Hopefully they won’t have questions about why. ) Rhonda at first wants to talk about having “a quarantine wedding” somehow, to find some creative way to get married in the near future with no more people present than necessary, done remotely or something. “I always sort of thought we’d elope,” she says, which I don’t really understand, because when we talked about our feelings on the topic of marriage early on in the process of getting to know each other I said (and she remembers me saying) that marriage was never a specific goal that I had for my life but that I did sometimes fantasize about planning a wedding reception and choosing the music that everyone would have to listen to. Anyway, as we talk it over I share some of the ideas about wedding planning that have been kicking around inside my head, and she really likes them. The park across the street from Rhonda’s apartment on Beach Avenue, next to Sunset Beach—an area that I have clear memories of even from my first time visiting the city of Vancouver, before I know anything about the existence of Rhonda—seemed like a natural place for it. It’s near the hill with the tree next to which she buried but was never able to recover some crystals one time; she felt a special connection to that tree and that hill. And getting a permit to have a small ceremony some day would not be expensive at all. And as I suggest it to Rhonda she says, “My mom lived right across the water from there. I spread some of her ashes there from Sunset Beach. And I just realized now—I haven’t known when or where to spread the rest of her ashes, but that’s where I’ll do it, on our wedding day. ” That’s assuming that it will be possible for people to fly to Vancouver from other parts of Canada and the United States and that a small wedding of probably under thirty people will be allowed and safe at the time we choose to get married. We’d like to get married before any child we might have would be born… so although we’re going to tell people we’re thinking of April or May of next year, we’ll probably hurry things along if Rhonda gets pregnant. Also, I like the idea of doing something with people in Massachusetts as well. I’ve had this idea of renting a space, nothing fancy, and having a karaoke wedding out there. Rhonda likes this idea as well, but yeah, we’ll have to see what the state of the world looks like as 2020 progresses. Eventually, after the proposal and our sleeping and our waking up and our discussing our plans, I tell her, “Okay—I think now would be a good time for you to start making phone calls. ” She was eager to tell people, but I was saying, “Why don’t we work out more of the details first, so we’ll know how to answer people’s questions about what we’re planning?” So she was sort of waiting for my okay to tell people, weird as that sounds. She calls Laura that same day, the 22nd. And the next day I call my mom. It’s the first time that my mom and Rhonda talk on the phone to each other. And that day and the next day, Rhonda tells more people. I tell Sheela. Rhonda and I look at wedding bands, showing each other ideas of what we think we might like for ourselves. And she gets back to tutoring and teaching classes, and I get back to cleaning the apartment and working on 100 Pages, and I’m chatting with River a little more than I had been for a while but I haven’t hinted at the engagement or even that I’m living with Rhonda, because I told them some months back that I was in a relationship that was going well and they haven’t followed up with any requests for personal information of that sort, and I think it probably complicates things for them when they try to conceive of my love life without them. I tell Dominic about the engagement over Facebook chat; he congratulates me, of course. But still, although my birthday was Wednesday, the weekend passes without us announcing on Facebook. This is fine by me, as I’m not very social on the Internet these days, not really in close touch with many people, and I’m not in a rush to type two-sentence-long statements about being engaged with people I’m not going to have extended conversations with at any point in the near future. I’ve told Rhonda I’m leaving it to her to write what announcement she wants, and she hasn’t got around to writing it yet. "

    "body": "88 May 4, 2020. We still haven’t announced on Facebook! 89 May 7, 2020. Okay, now we’ve announced on Facebook. Rhonda wrote several very nice paragraphs for the occasion:  I have a very exciting announcement!!!!2 weeks ago, just after midnight at the threshold of his 39th birthday—April 22, 2020—Adam Marcel Ares, the epic love of my life, proposed!!!I was absolutely over the moon to accept: in the 15 months we’ve been 	dating, Adam has reached far beyond what I hoped might be possible in a partner for me. He has qualities I’ve been seeking for so long, and those that surprise me—those I didn’t know I needed but that complement me in ways that make me certain that I can still be the very best version of myself. He provides a stimulating environment for me to grow into the exciting and strong artist and thinker I’d almost stopped believing I could be, and he provides a safe space for me to unravel when I need to let go. I’ve always felt happiest alone—but being with Adam brings together the joy of being alone, the joy of being in the company of a best friend, and the joy of loving a romantic partner. Adam is a fellow writer and reader whose passion for language and literature supports me in my creative and scholarly work. He is an Occupational Therapist whose commitment to care work and dedication to humanity resonates with my own commitment to care and social responsibility. He is a musician whose gifts of song have encouraged my voice to rise up and play. He is a gorgeous man and a magical human being whose rare combination of strength and vulnerability, intelligence and understanding, integrity and openness, kindness and humour, nourishes me every day as he works with me on practicing emotional regulation and communication, encouraging me to take care of myself and be the healthiest version of myself. We have so much in common: we both grew up only children, incredibly independent yet deeply affectionate. We have both had complex and surprising life journeys—faced strange winds blowing in never-expected directions—and we have both made the choice to live differently, in creative collaboration with the gales that have tossed us—not according to particular standards but according to our own integrity. We’ve both had time to grow into ourselves and reach a place of clarity and knowing that is still full of questions and ongoing learning—an excellent place to join forces and create a home and a future together. I’m so excited to build a life with you, Adam, and to share this news with friends and family. More to follow as our plans unfold. ❤️❤️❤️ 90 It’s more Rhonda than I who has people ready to congratulate her. That was always going to be true. I’m not sure how much the relative silence on the part of my Facebook friends has to do with the algorithm, how much as to do with people feeling shy about reacting to a post by Rhonda if they don’t know her, and how much is actually people not feeling like they want to congratulate me. In any case, moving forward in life has always been isolating for me in unpredictable ways. The best I can do is to keep sticking to my values, trying to add something to the world, trying to be a person who is worth having around. In the context of these ambitions, starting a family with Rhonda seems like the best thing that could have happened to me. Unlike my friends, though, the Fortins—my mom’s side of the family—have been responsive. Sometimes, I know, I’m just quick to see people’s actions or inactions as signals that they are ready to dismiss me from their lives for fun and/or profit. Meanwhile Katja, for example, has been reaching out again (pre-announcement—I told her personally about the engagement during a chat on Facebook) and clearly wanting to reconnect… even though for years I’ve had it in my head somehow that she was pulling away. 91 It took two or three days longer than planned, but we got all of Rhonda’s stuff out from her old apartment at 1011 Ocean Avenue. Meanwhile, the people of Vancouver have been coming out of their homes again, more and more, and enjoying the Spring weather. It feels dangerous and scary, in part because I spend so much time reading people’s social media posts from down in the States (where, for example, the death rate per capita in Massachusetts is twenty times that in British Columbia). But when I look closely I see that people are following the recommended social distancing measures, for the most part—it’s not like most people are failing to take the pandemic seriously or anything. They’re just outdoors getting exercise by riding bikes or walking along dedicated sidewalks with their families. I walked around Sunset Beach Park and took pictures to send to my mom, to show her where Rhonda and I are thinking about getting married. (“I’m surprised people don’t do that more often there,” Rhonda has said, to which I’ve speculated that it’s because the events are required to be kept so small. ) The first picture I took of the area was particularly gorgeous to the point of looking face, like the sort of computer-generated mock-up of a planned park that would be presented to try and secure approval and funding. Of course, the photo I snapped from out the window of the 29th floor apartment Rhonda is leaving was gorgeous, too. Vancouver is just a place full of pretty views. 92 And putting things on the walls—oh, wow! This apartment, which I was already so happy with, only made happier by Rhonda joining me there, seems lovelier still once her various wall hangings have been integrated with mine. Choosing with where where the different things should be placed was great—a lot of fun. Meanwhile, to make sure there are appropriate spots for all of our books, me driving around to various London Drugs locations around the city to pick up multiples of a particular $12 wooden crate they sell there. (Our book collection is about 50% from me and 50% from her, if you don’t count the many dissertation-related library books she also has in a separate stack. ) There was a sale at one particular web site and so I’ve ordered maps of different areas of the world, which will go up in the area around the bed and near the big map of North America. I considered getting rid of my keyboard, but Rhonda gasped at the thought. It sounds like she aspires to try using it sometime. (I don’t remember how much experience she has with playing keyboards, but I don’t think it’s much more than I have. ) Overall, with all her stuff here, it looks like we still have a lot of space. The apartment is more comfortable than it was before, actually, because she brought a couple of small tables and because we’ve had to think intentionally about where various things should go. 93 When my update my relationship status on Facebook to “engaged” I get a lot more responses than I did when I was tagged in the post that Rhonda made. I really am quick to expect that people are ready to never talk to me again, that people have abandoned me. 94 Walking in Vancouver by myself, listening to old cassettes. Stores reopening, a beautiful day. Things feeling almost back to normal. Flower shops open, just with social distancing rules in place. I buy some tulips and set them in our vase. I have a job interview tomorrow at Elite Academy, where Rhonda has tutored and taught for a number of years now. 95 May 8, 2020. Rhonda comes with me to the interview. Her presence seems to throw off the people doing the interviewing when I arrive. I don’t actually realize that the person she’s saying hello to is the person I’m going to be interviewing with until she motions for me to follow her, that sort of thing. They’re impressed with the degrees that I have and the universities I’ve attended. I take a practice SAT test, then walk out to the lobby and hand it over to the person who’s going to grade it. While that’s happening Rhonda comes over from where she’s been photocopying some course materials and talks with me. The person with the test results walks me across the room and says I got a hundred percent on the writing section but missed five questions on the reading comprehension section. She says that’s fine anyway and that Iris will contact me when she knows what they need me for: “She would come and talk to you now, but she has meetings. ” But then as I walk back to Rhonda to leave Iris walks over, and I’m not sure if she’s talking to Rhonda or to me, so it’s confusing. I guess I have no reason to suspect the company won’t give me work, but I still feel uncertain about it until after I’ve returned with Rhonda to our apartment, napped with her for a while, lain in bed for a long time while she works from the little room, made myself a coffee, and eventually left with Rhonda to go for a walk through the increasingly busy Vancouver downtown. (Sunset Beach is busier than Rhonda has ever seen it this time of year; the two of us end up finding elsewhere to sit so that she can meditate and I can do some reading before we walk back home. ) “Hi, fiancé,” she often says. I say cutesy things like, “I was wondering… when you said you would marry me, how long were you willing to stay married to me for? Two years, three years?” It’s gentle talk—building, I think, a glaze of comfort and familiarity in whatever we might say to each other. We don’t do the pet name thing. I’m inclined to talk in a childish, playfully faux-innocent tone… but that’s something I always do with people to some extent when I’m comfortable with them. We’re thinking the 22nd of May, 2021 would be a good day for a ceremony at Sunset Beach, if she doesn’t get pregnant before this Fall. (If it happens that she gets pregnant and is likely to give birth before the wedding date, we will probably move things earlier. ) 96 May 11, 2020. There is, I suppose, a high likelihood that the number of COVID-19 cases in Vancouver will be increasing soon, giving people’s behaviour over the course of this Mother’s Day weekend. But this is also, I suppose, part of the plan, since elimination of the virus is no one’s expectation. By all accounts the health care system here in British Columbia is less strained than usual because of the precautions that have been taken. We’re all used to locking ourselves inside, now, and I suppose that we’ll do it again if we have to. By “we” I of course mean “people in Canada”. What is happening in the U. S. is a different story, the details of which I imagine will be obfuscated and made contentious in the decades to come. I would rather move forward from the days when the integrity of my narrative demanded that I make assertions about the realities of early twenty-first century America. 97 May 13, 2020. I have a Skype interview lined up for a different school, one that is much like Elite (who haven’t contacted me yet). I also heard back from some type of social services job that I applied for. It has been forty-five days since I filed for unemployment insurance in Washington state. They are supposedly dedicating the next seven days (or something like that) to clearing out the adjudication queue, which I am in. We’ll see if that means anything for me. Rhonda’s engagement ring was shipped back to us after being resized. It’s still a little big, but that’s better than it being a little small. Meanwhile, I’ve ordered my wedding band. Only one tulip left. I should get more flowers for the vase. Rhonda has what was her stepmother’s ring and liked the idea of me using the diamond from it. I think I like the way a classic “women’s” style solitaire engagement ring will look on my hand along with a “men’s” style wedding band. I figured getting the band first would be a better opportunity to make sure I have my ring size correct, since the company selling the ring that I want offers a free resizing, while the company I’m looking at for my engagement ring doesn’t. Rhonda has been sleeping a lot these past few days. Hopefully I’m doing the right things to support her when she feels overwhelmed. And it looks like I’ll have another Skype interview tomorrow. I’m not sure exactly what the job is—something social services related. I applied a while ago. I’ll have to look into it before I talk with them, obviously. I’m still not sure it wouldn’t be more practical for me not to be doing any job searching at all. America doesn’t like to keep its workers informed of the rules of the game they have to play to stay alive. Same as in the health insurance system there, where the potential costs people are insuring themselves against are secret, yet the ability to choose between different plans is talked about as if it’s an essential human right. The political discourse down there is basically millions of dollars being thrown around to debate the question “Should people be allowed to choose between a knife and a gun before they’re kicked into a pitch black room to do battle with a secret monster? Or should the government decide what weapon is most likely to slay the monster? If too many monsters get slain, who will pay for the new monsters?!” Yeesh. Good job not opining about America, Adam. 98 I keep watching British Columbia’s COVID numbers and they still haven’t exploded, even though people have been out and frolicking and have changed the city from looking desolate and apocalyptic to looking like a paradise in which nearly everyone is on vacation. Now that I’m less terrified of the outdoors, I want to start trying to go for a walk daily. I did yesterday—I walked from home down to the sea wall at Stanley Park—and today I set off trying to do it again, but didn’t get very far before I felt a shard of glass inside my shoe, tearing up my foot. (Rhonda and I both accidentally break glass items all over the place all the time. We really just should try to use glass as little as possible at this point. It’s ridiculous. ) I took off my shoe and indeed, my sock had a fresh hole in it, and the heel of my left foot was bloody. I seemed to get the piece of glass out, though, and when I kept walking it didn’t hurt, so I made it down to Stanley Park again before walking back home. I’ve been abstaining from alcohol, something I suggested to Rhonda I might do to encourage her to do the same, and which she shrugged off initially but later requested. The idea is that while we’re trying to conceive we’ll both only drink at times when she’s on her period. If she gets pregnant we’ll see what feels right with regard to my having drinks on occasion or not. I wouldn’t say it feels good to be without nicotine and without alcohol, but it was about time for me to remind myself that I can do so and be fine (at least under the right circumstances—work pressure can make the risks of nicotine appear far outweighed by the benefits to my concentration). 99 May 15, 2020. Another interview over Skype. Yesterday’s seemed all business, and in that case I made my responses terse to match the hurried manner of the person doing the interviewing. Today’s is for a different type of work—in group homes and, apparently, variations on that type of work. The person interviewing me has a lot to say about the different programs and the services they provide, then she has a lot of the “give an example when” and “say you’re in a situation where you need to” questions that all my interviewing for OT jobs has helped me to get used to. She says they always start people on the job by having them work in casual positions. She definitely gives the impression that she’s ready to take me on, pending a reference check. (Which, as usual, I’m going to try not to really think about unless and until I need to. I don’t want to stress myself out over what has historically been an impossible to predict crapshoot in which sometimes I get people singing my praises and other times people ignore me and my life falls apart. ) And I take another walk to the same general spot and then back, this time re-listening to old They Might Be Giants instead of re-listening to new Fiona Apple. No bleeding in my shoe today, hurrah! I respond to an email from the academy that I Skype interviewed with yesterday. I agree to go in to their main location in Richmond to take some tests. Still no word on my unemployment insurance claim, fifty-nine days after I last worked. Working in earnest on a version of Sunset and Dawn that doesn’t compromise the privacy of the real-life supporting characters in any legally or morally dubious way. Halfway through finally reading the hardcover copy of Thomas Pynchon’s Bleeding Edge that I bought when it first came out in 2013. 100 May 19, 2020. The interview in Richmond, or what I thought would be an interview. They told me that what I was going in for was test-taking, but, yeah, I forgot. I walk through the shopping mall, where all the signs have words in Chinese or Korean. I do my best to follow the descending suite numbers to find the place. What is the word for this type of school, even? It’s all tutoring or classes meant to supplement the provincial curriculum or standardized test prep. Rhonda, who once interviewed for this company but returned to working at Elite instead, has told me that it’ll probably be Chinese students learning English as a second language, overachieving, trying to make it to Ivy League schools. We’re still not sure what happened with Elite. It could be that they just don’t have a need for anyone yet. The job that would have me working in group homes and stuff has heard from one of my references, not heard from a second one… and the third one, I realized, I only gave a phone number for, not an email, so I passed that information along today and the person said she has now emailed that one, too. I’ve received a message from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue asking for copies of all the identification they could ever possibly think to ask for, including my social security card, which I don’t have. Getting a replacement social security card while I’m in Canada requires me to mail my actual physical identification through the mail to a particular social security administration office in the States (in this case the one in Bellingham, Washington). After I’ve placed my British Columbia driver’s license in an envelope with the form I had to print and complete, I mail it at London Drugs. 101 May 20, 2020. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue says that if I don’t have a copy of my social security card to upload by the date listed on the letter I received I should just upload whatever else I have and expect that they’ll reply with another request for just the social security card, which I can then upload as soon as I have it. Restaurants are open again. Restaurants are open again?! Pubs look the same as they ever did; from the sidewalk I don’t really see any modifications to seating or anything. Employees are wearing masks, but that’s about it. Groups of four sit around small tables on sidewalk patios, same as they did last May. But there were only, what was it, two new COVID cases in BC yesterday? But I suppose people here are ready to go into lockdown again if instructed to. There are actual public health experts involved in the management of things up in Canada, so it’s not ridiculous to take government advisories at something close to face value. I get a job offer from Time Education. I accept. Talking to Rhonda about wedding and engagement ring stuff is always a little risky, as it leads to her hyperfocusing and stressing about the decisions that need to be made. It stresses me out, too, because I tell her I’ll do the work on her behalf to deal with jewelers and all that… but then I have to wrap my mind around what she’s looking for in a wedding band, and where things don’t quite make sense to me I have to differentiate the things I don’t know about wedding rings from the things she doesn’t know about wedding rings. But it’s exciting to think of what we’ll have in the end. I go to Hudson’s Bay Company to figure out my ring size. They have one of those things with a bunch of different sized rings that you can try on, but the woman behind the counter doesn’t want to help me with it and seems eager to get me to go away. Is it because I’m wearing a mask and that still seems weird to her, since her place of work has been closed for a couple of months now? Or is she just out of the swing of things? It occurs to me that I am the first customer she has seen since whenever the pandemic closed that store down. Anyway, I have a better time at Tiffany and Co. , which also has just re-opened today. I pretend that I’m considering their rings and my experience trying on things there confirms what seemed like the right size for me at Hudson’s Bay (size 11). I have to hurry up and try to get through this process of changing names and other details in Sunset and Dawn. I don’t think I want to try publishing it any time soon, but I do think I want to have a publishable version alongside a more faithful to reality version. "

    "body": "1 June 23, 2021. Rhonda got her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine last night. She reports that her arm is a bit sore, and the soreness has started to spread a bit, but she doesn’t have a fever like I did, and mostly she’s feeling all right. 2 Soon I’ll be able to visit the US again. Until now I would have needed to quarantine when I came back. So, I have some staring at my calendar to do. I walk through downtown Vancouver to a spot at Coal Harbour that the Internet tells me has happy hour until 6. I can still make it there in time to get a glass of wine at reduced cost. 3 Sitting by the water. People in weird little boats are floating by. Today is a mostly clear day. Warm for Vancouver. A heat wave is expected in the coming week. 4 I got married two months and one day ago. Remembering that I’m with Rhonda is always reassuring. 5 June 25, 2021. A few new music releases that I’m keen to listen to today. My interest in this sort of thing is about what it has always been–idiosyncratic, inconsistent, but meaningful. Lucy Dacus is one of the first shows I have plans to see as events of that sort begin to happen again. Her new album just came out, so I’m listening to that one first. I’m at work. I haven’t been able to work as an occupational therapist for the past year, being in Canada, where the hurdles thrown at foreign-trained therapists are onerous to the point of perversion. I’ve been doing the type of thing I did while applying to OT schools a decade ago: I’m caring for clients in group homes. Since October I’ve been doing overnights, on my own, with a client who lives on one floor of a house while another client lives downstairs. My client is asleep now, and it’s about four in the morning. I’m sitting at the table in the kitchen. A bunch of my junk is on the table: laptop, tablet computer, notebooks and planners and scraps of paper. An external DVD-ROM drive and a spindle of blank CD-Rs, which are anachronistic in the year 2021. I listen to the music using my laptop. There’s a playlist on the artist’s YouTube page. And–hey there! If it isn’t involuntary memory! I listened to Lucy Dacus’s prior album, Historian, the night it was released, too. I listened to it in a hotel room in Ottawa, where I had just landed to confirm my status as a permanent resident of Canada. I didn’t know anyone in this country yet, then. 6 Monday, June 28, 2021. When I saw that there was a heat wave coming to Vancouver and that today would be the worst of it I texted my work manager and asked for tonight off. I know what heat does to my sleep, my mood, and my overall will to live. This seemed like as good a time as any for me to use some of the holiday pay that I’ve been banking since I started with this organization a year ago. Then, on Friday night, I saw that the temperature forecasts were being adjusted upward to 40C/104F for Monday. I’ve never been more than mildly uncomfortable from the heat in Vancouver, even living in a fourteenth floor apartment without air conditioning, but those numbers were high enough to take very seriously. I looked into a weekend getaway–places I might bring Rhonda that wouldn’t be super expensive or difficult to get to and where we could stay in an air conditioned room. And that’s why we’re presently in the town of Sechelt, on the Sunshine Coast of B. C. We took a quick ferry ride, sitting on the outside deck and watching the green islandss of the Straight of Georgia pass by. I told Rhonda that this is one of the things I really like about the Pacific Northwest, what it looks like from the waterways cutting through it from the Pacific. It just feels right to me. 7 July 6, 2021. Our two nights in the hotel were pleasant. Many of the local businesses were closed due to the heat; Pizza Hut was open but not cooking pizza. We drove to what’s called Smuggler Bay. An easy thirty or so minute hike through the woods, over some swamps, past two types of snakes took us to the water. Rhonda chose the beach where she wanted to swim. I crouched in the shadow of rocks and swiped at the unfamiliar bugs near my feet. I was warm, but not beaten down by the heat. When we got back to our apartment two of my diplomas had fallen off the wall. Could that have been heat-related? But the nails were still in the wall. 8 I interviewed for a different position within the organization that I’ve been working for. I forgot to memorize the mission statement–that’s always one of the interview questions. The interviewer helped me with the answers to some of the questions, because fairness cannot exist in a human society. I might not actually accept the new position if I’m offered it, though: I mostly just wanted it because I thought I was going to be starting a new part-time OT job south of the border, and the schedule of this new position would have fit better an international commute. But I now know that I’m not starting that job, because I couldn’t find two employment references to provide, because, again, fairness cannot exist in a human society, and that lack of fairness is not always to my advantage. 9 Tik Tok is an app that provides video entertainment. Instead of paying its creators it manipulates their emotions and algorithmically incentivizes the behaviour it wants from them. I myself experimented with making content for it–unusual content, with no video of me to be found in it at all. I drew with my finger onto my iPad, then manipulated and animated the resulting stick figures somewhat, to accompany thirty-to-sixty second sections of my diary-novel, Sunset and Dawn. The view counts were higher than a forty-year-old nobody in 2021 is used to getting for internet content that hasn’t been promoted, but that isn’t saying much amid the carnival of self-promotion that is Gen Z culture. No one was subscribing or commenting. My curiosity was satisfied and I had no further interest, so it was on to the next unwitnessed project for me. I still watch other peoples’ content on there a little bit, though. Tonight at work while my client was sleeping I watched a man whose authority I didn’t trust at all offer an explanation of “the fourth dimension”. (Then, in the follow-up video, he explained the fifth dimension! Quite prodigious, that guy. ) In Sunset and Dawn I used occasional intrusions of science fiction elements to suggest disruption of the narrative conventions that pushed my life forward into cycles of conflict and resolution. I came up with a whole thing about the fourth and fifth dimensions and how they allowed for different types of time travel, and how near-infinite instances of time travel shaped not only the dimensions we know but also the ones we didn’t yet understand. But despite this, I’ve never really been one of those theoretical-math-and-physics people. Never even been a sci-fi person, to be honest. Even so, here I am, with a multi-volume diary turned magic reality fantasy novel that covers the first half of my statistically anticipated lifespan. And that book ended with me deciding that I needn’t always be at the center of my own story–that stories are a magic that comes and goes, and that no story is more important than any person. (I’m not really trying to escape anything anymore. I always was before. And I’m glad that I was. I feel like I escaped a lot. ) Now I’m sitting on my balcony watching the crows that land on buildings below. I have two books from the library with me: What Was Said To Me: The Life of St’tum’atul’wut, a Cowichan Woman, by Ruby Peter, and Groundwork: Autobiographical Writings 1971-2012 by Paul Auster. My wife is inside. She’s having a work-related meeting over Zoom. Things have mellowed out for me. I don’t need to be a protagonist this time. There are too many protagonists out there already. I often preferred the writings I did when I was just documenting what I saw around me. There are too many “I”s, but perhaps still the need for another eye. 10 July 10, 2021. The same happy hour I was at before the heat wave. Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’” over the speakers. Another day that makes me sweat. I walked from my apartment to English Bay, then along the sea wall for a bit. I called Sheela. She was driving with Isabella from some child-friendly destination in Worcester. We made plans to FaceTime on Tuesday. Hopefully Rhonda will be free to take part in it. I imagine she probably will make time for it. 11 Aug 2, 2021. Seeing Dominic in Portland was great–our jokey conversations with each other, going out to karaoke and all that. I don’t have the same reaction to the city of Portland itself that I once did: I arrived while Dominic was still at work, and as I walked around the Alberta Arts District I sort of was just thinking, “Ugh, that’s a long drive to get here from Vancouver. ” Our night at Chopsticks was pretty Portland-typical, which is to say that it oscillated between inspirational and uncomfortable, and it was never clear in advance whether the next moment would be one or the other. I hung out with Aurora; we went to the dog park and dog-watched (which was a good idea that I would never have thought of), we ate some Thai food, and we went to Hive for a bit. Also during my trip Dominic and I met up with Ori, went to Ground Kontrol, and then sat outside of that pizza place across from Powell’s while the sky got dark. I had stopped for a COVID test somewhere in King County, Washington to prepare for Canada’s requirement of showing a negative result from within 72 hours when entering the country. There was also an arrival test I needed to take, but when it happened it was simple enough, and in my case there wasn’t a wait for it. Someone just stood next to my car and instructed me as I self-administered a swab of my gums and nose. 12 Aug 6, 2021. I lie down in bed when Rhonda does, but I get up, wanting to listen to the song “Don’t Give Up” by Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush. The level of sentimentality that the lyrics live in will be forever unreachable to me except vicariously. I listen to the earnest performance those two singers put into it and I’m like, That’s nice. Some people need to hear somebody telling them not to give up in order to feel better. But me, I need to hear somebody telling somebody else not to give up. When I hear such a thing said to me directly I close off my own feelings and immediately focus on the person, making sure that I appreciate the kindness of their gesture. Because a more honest response to the sentiment, if I were to dwell on it for more than an instant, would be, “You think I’d be alive right now if I waited for encouragement to not give up?” Strength becomes darkness in the rear view mirror. I heard today that a client I’ve worked with might be dying. I haven’t mentioned it to anybody yet, which reminds me of how long it has been since someone I’ve recently spoken with, fed, touched, whom I’ve seen naked, whose urine-soaked bed I’ve changed has died without my mentioning it to anyone. That’s what happens when you stop working in nursing homes for a while. Yesterday I went with Rhonda to her therapy, but the discussion wasn’t about our relationship or anything that she needed to talk about with me. If anything, as it turned out, I sort of made an argument against the therapist’s cognitive-behavioural approach to her difficulties with her dissertation. As much as I want her to finish and earn her Ph. D (for multiple reasons!) it has been getting harder to watch her going through what she goes through, and I’ve started to worry that it might be wrong to not comment on how out of proportion I think the effort and the reward could end up being to each other. When asked for my perspective I rhetorically asked, “How many days days lost are worth it for a Ph. D? How much self-harm is worth it for a Ph. D?” Given that it was before noon when I sat in on the session, it felt miraculous that I could be so articulate. The therapist said, “I seem to have an unpopular opinion,” and stayed on track, which I’m sure was appropriate. I’m glad he heard what I had to say, for whatever it’s worth in the context of her therapy. Oh. And the career that Canada gave me permanent residence so that I could come and do in their country, because of my experience in that career, and because they need people to do that job? After a two year long, $3k+ assessment process they have told me that my education hasn’t prepared me to sit for their licensure exam, and that in fact there’s no additional schooling or anything I can do to ever be qualified to sit for their licensure exam. I might even worry that they had a point if not for the fact that in 2015, before they put additional hurdles in place for foreign-trained occupational therapists, I passed that very licensure exam on my first try. I’ll check into my legal options, write to my member of parliament, shake my fist at the heavens and so forth, but I’m going to assume that I will never work in that field in this country. This complicates my plans, but my plans have been complicated for at least as long as they’ve been feasible, so I’m rolling with that punch. We’ll see how Rhonda’s job options factor in as time goes by, but when I factor in all the many things that need to be factored into a projection like this, I’m feeling like we’ll probably stay in BC.

Before I tell you the story, now, I’ll tell you about the uh… characters. First there’s Miss O’Leary… don’t forget that it’s “Miss”, now, because people do that a lot. Miss O’Leary is a good teacher, she has a good sense of humor, she is the teacher of 27, I think it is now, kids. One of her students, Levi Adams, is known for Nintendo, we will focus around him the most, and, um, did I mention that he’s known for Nintendo? “Good morning, boys and girls,” said Miss O’Leary to the class. “Good morning, Miss O’Leary,” answered the class. Not much happened during the morning, so I’ll tell you about what happened at recess. Not much had changed from the rest of the year. The kids were getting along just fine… “Ow! Stop that!” Well, almost. Anyway, as I said before, not much had changed. If you told a noonmother that someone had stolen your swing, she’d tell you to tell him to give it back. If the kid wouldn’t get off, the noonmother would just say the same thing again. So you had to give up. People stole swings, fell off of elevated tires, and scaled walls of the playground. There were few injuries that day (34, 35?) and yeah, so the rest of recess was normal, except for the end. That was when someone suddenly swiped Jeremiah’s hand-held video game, Flashlight Dude. No one was expecting it. Here’s how it happened. Jeremiah finished playing, he put the game down, then yelled to Anthony that he could play it. Then, as Jer turned around, he saw a figure running away with the game! Anthony saw what happened and rushed to help. “He went that way!” yelled Jeremiah to Tony, over the roar of the wind, pointing towards the Selser School field. Selser School was the school that Bowie kids went to when they were in a high enough grade. “He must be a Selser kid!” yelled Anthony back to Jeremiah. Levi happened to be nearby, so Tony yelled for him to join the chase. Then something terrible happened. “He’s running into Selser School! We’re not allowed to go into Selser!” “Too bad!” said Levi, “We have to get the hand-held game back!” “I don’t know,” said Anthony. “Well, okay, I’ll go with you. ” But it was too late by then: the two of them had strayed into the woods. It took them all of recess to find their way out. When the kids watched the news that night, the reporter said: “A local boy has been sent to prison for 9,987 years for stealing a hand-held game. Unfortunately, the game was crushed by the boy when he became angry at getting arrested. ” “Gee, doesn’t that seem a little harsh for just stealing a little game?” asked Anthony. “Well, I have no objections,” said Jeremiah. 9 The next day, Miss O’Leary’s class received a new student that morning. His name? Charles Cunningham! Charles had been in Levi’s second grade class. But he was anything but a friend. Charles (or “Baddokid”, as Levi called him) was Levi’s worst enemy. (Oh, and Charles was in Levi’s first grade class, not his second. ) But he moved away, thanks to Levi, Zachary, and Miguel. Here’s what happened: “All right, Levi! Now you’ll be burned to toast on the burning slide! And you have shorts on!” yelled Baddokid. Levi was struggling with Baddo. (Ad called himself Superkid. ) Then, out of nowhere, came Zachary and Miguel! The kids snuck up behind Charles and blew a whistle right in his ear! (Ow!) Baddokid pushed Levi down the slide, as Miguel and Zack watched with fear in their eyes. “No!” yelled Zachary, lunging for the hot, hot slide, but all he managed to do was to knock Baddokid down it. But what of Levi? “Hey, I need some help down here!” It was his voice! “I’m losing my grip!” Now that, that was a different voice. The voice of Baddokid! “Oh yeah,” said Levi, “I saved Charles!” Later, Levi told Baddokid that if he didn’t stop bugging the Superkid, the kids would blow the whistle in his ear and tell the teacher about what he had done. Charles agreed. He was the ex-Baddokid. Now he was in Miss O’Leary’s class! Many of the kids recognized him instantly. Levi raised his hand. He told the teacher that Charles had been in his first grade class. Charles yelled, “Levi!” 10 That recess was terrible! First, the secret got out, and everybody called Levi “Superkid”. Second, Charles Cunningham was Baddokid again! He wanted a radical revenge! As soon as Charley the bad dude (hey, I like that) saw Levi (Captain L) Super-Duper Dude Kid (I really like that), he charged. And without a credit card! At the last moment, Levi moved. Charley “Chaplin” crashed into the brick school wall. He never was that bright. That made Charley angry. He started chasing Levi, Levi ran. Suddenly, Levi turned around, nailing Charley-warley in the stomach. Charging Charles ran away, but he soon returned—with a gigantic stick! Charles in Charge swung the almost-tree-trunk-looking stick around and (this is the good part) Levi grabbed the end of the stick and swung Cheap Charley around and around. Soon, Levi swiped the stick out of Baddo-dude’s hand. “Thanks,” he said. By the time Charles Not-so-CUNNINGham finally found Levi the totally cool, super duper rad and all around nice guy, it was time to go back inside! There, the kids found out that Charles Cunningham, a. k. a. Baddokid, had accidentally been sent to the wrong school. Charles was gone that day, but Levi would not be able to sleep safe knowing that Baddokid was somewhere in Chicopee. Levi was not going to rest until Charles Cunningham was where he should be—reform school! (What is that, anyway?) 11 It was after school. Levi was playing Nintendo at Anthony’s house. Things were pretty much back to normal. Then, Levi defeated Gannon in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. All of a sudden, the television blew up! Anthony asked, “Are you all right, Levi?” “Oh, yeah!” said Levi, “But I think your TV needs a trip to the hospital. ” Anthony nodded knowingly. “L-l-Levi!” yelled Anthony, “Your arm… it’s like… like it’s metallic or something!” Anthony was right. Levi’s arm was a silvery color. “Look!” cried Anthony, “On the TV!” Words had appeared on the screen! They said, PLEASE EXCUSE MY SON. BUT IT IS JUST AS GOOD. WHICH ONE OF YOU HAS A METALLIC ARM? WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU DOES, YOU ARE MR. VIDEO: THE ULTIMATE VIDEO GAMER! YOU NOW WILL BE TRANSPORTED TO VIDEO WORLD, WHERE YOU WILL TAKE A TEST TO SEE IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAVE THE WORLD. xtu-768j “Did he say what I think he just sai…” started Levi, but he was stopped short by a warp zone in his friend’s living room. 12 “Hello aaaand welcome to another contest to see if we can find a person to save the Earth!” said a computerized voice, “And what is your given name, Mr. Video?” “L…Levi A…Adams, sir. ” “And now for the first event—Taekwonvideo!” Three minutes later, it was time to start. “Go!” yelled the voice. Levi remembered Taekwondo from Track And Field II and decided to use some of his tricks for the game. The opponent used a foot sweep on Levi. Levi fell. As the opponent tried to kick Levi when he was down, Levi rolled away, causing his opponent to slip and fall. As soon as both of the contestants were up, Levi ran. The opponent followed. Suddenly, Levi turned around and kneed the opponent right in the stomach. The opponent stepped back in pain, 1…2…3…4…5…6…7…8…9…10! “The winner! L-Levi A-Adams, also known as Mr. Video!” The crowd applauded like crazy. Levi had passed the first test, but what was this about saving the world? And who was this computerized voice? Levi wanted some answers. “Okay!” yelled Levi, “Who are you? And what is this about saving the world?” “That’s for me to know, and for you to find out,” remarked the voice, “The next event is the obstacle course!” 13 “Listen,” said Levi, “Whoever you are, I’m coming to get you. You can tell me your side of the story when I find you. ” There was no response. Levi looked around. There was a staircase leading to a door on his left. He headed for it. As he was climbing, the stairs suddenly turned into a giant slide! Levi grabbed the railing and slowly worked his way up. When he got to the top, he found that the door was locked! He stepped back and with all of his strength kicked the door down. As he stepped inside, the computerized voice said, “I congratulate you for getting this far. But I will now finish you off!” “You know,” said Levi calmly, “I heard something like that in Ninja Gaiden. ” Then he saw him. He was an old man with a cane. “You’re the powerful wizard of Oz?” joked Levi. “I do not understand your humor,” said the old man, “My name is Matthew Cunningham. ” “M-m-Matthew CUNNINGHAM?” asked Levi, “Are you perchance related to Charles Cunningham?” “Yes,” answered the, uh, Matthew, “Are you perchance Superkid?” “I am,” answered Levi. Matthew lunged for Levi. Levi hit him. Matthew fell back in pain. As Levi went to kick again, Matthew flew up, punching Levi in the face and knocking him down. Matthew was about to jump on Superkid, in order to do what Charles could not! 14 Levi rolled away at the last second, causing Matthew to crash into the hard ground. Then Matthew revealed his true identity—Anthony! “I had you going there for awhile, didn’t I?” remarked Antonio. He explained how he had taken out xtu-768j. He had used a strange sphere to look like an old man. Seconds later, Levi and Anthony were returned to Earth. As soon as they came home, they forgot all about Video World (for one night). 15 Levi Adams was (this is real, now) a normal kid, and he was usually found groovin’ to the beat of Michael Jackson. (ages 2-3) Later (ages 4-5) he formed a club by using a laundry washroom of his Grandmother’s house. Each of the members (Levi and his cousins) had a desk. Levi’s cousins were: Kenneth and Christopher, Amy, and Jodi. They named their club “The Kids Club”. They didn’t do much, though. They just put up posters and talked about how much grown-ups were bothering them. Soon, the Kids Club was gone. They were no longer allowed to use the washroom. So later, when Memé bought a new freezer, the kids used the box as a clubhouse. They changed the name to “The Rainbow Connection Club”. Later, the box was taken away to put Christmas presents in! The kids never saw their clubhouse again. Soon, the kids were making clubs at Levi’s house, using his room: The Isis Club, The Motech Club (Ad’s personal fav) and The Jr. Nintendo Club. The Jr. Nintendo Club was canceled not long ago. Just a few months ago, or a year, or a decade, depending on when you read this, Levi and Chris, Ken and Amy made a video game creating company: A. K. C. , Awesome Kids’ Cartridges. It was stopped short by an issue of Nintendo Power, which said that kids could not submit games to Nintendo of America, Inc. Now, Levi is writing this book, and is starring in this book, along with his real fourth grade classmates! 16 The next day at school there was a video game contest, but Levi—that is, I—really didn’t have my heart in it. Probably it was because my home life was getting sort of weird. I was in my mom’s room one night when, as usual, she was telling my father to go away. He was in a bad mood and getting upset because he felt that he was being kept from both his wife and his son. I had been talking peacefully to Mom about something while we had watched sitcoms. My father yelled from behind the door that it wasn’t right for her to disrespect him like this because he was the man of the house and I yelled for him to stop it and to go away but that only angered him more as he (who spanked me often and effectively, molding me into a polite person) accused my mother of turning me against him. This was all so unfair, I thought. Why couldn’t “stop it” mean “stop it”? I was a good kid! (Although sometimes I wasn’t able to understand what I was doing that was wrong. Then, nothing could stop the retribution for sins that I hadn’t learned enough to understand. Sometimes punishments were given in error, if he hadn’t heard me saying “excuse me” while I was passing him in the hallway. I was never hungry. I was frightened to leave my room. Nobody wants to hear you whine. ) Why was he doing this? He began to speak in the tone of voice that he used when he thought he was tempering his emotions: “Keep Levi away from the door. I’m going to break it down. I’m serious, Loraine. ” I continued to yell for him to stop. They were both using bad words, but he kept talking about what he was entitled to, what was right, how marriage was a union under God and how a wife was expected to obey her husband. “Levi, get out of the way! Is he out of the way? He’d better be, Loraine. ” Whereas before, I had improvised radio plays and taped them into a cassette recorder. In general, when I was at home, I was in my room, while my father was on the other side of the door, in the living room, in front of the television.  At each commercial break he would knock on my door and say, “Hey, I’m just checking up on you. ” I hated that! So annoying! In addition (if I am to tell you that soon, everything would begin to seem annoying) the lock on my door was not very secure. My parents started to pick it with a stick of incense when they needed to talk to me, instead of knocking. I was beginning to wish for privacy. What did I do in my room? I bounced on the bed to CDs. I clapped my hands together, quickly, percussively. I rocked back and forth. Sometimes, I waved my arms around. I didn’t know whether everybody my age had so much energy that they didn’t show in public, or if this, like my throat clearing, like my eye-rolling tic, was just another strange and embarrassing thing that was unique about me. I thought my parents blamed me for the tics, because they kept telling me to stop it, stop it. I was becoming melancholy. I wanted to cry and feel sorry for myself… but to whom? My unhappiness was another strange and embarrassing thing unique to me, like the throat clearing, which didn’t really mean that I was trying to get someone’s attention. I would ask my younger cousins whether they could still remember what it had been like to be a baby. I couldn’t remember that far back. My earliest memories were of a fictional character named Levi Adams. I made him up and wrote him down. "

    "body": "17 May, 1992. It all started one day in REACH, the class for gifted students I was in. The teacher announced that some of us would be in a news program—CHICOPEE SCHOOL NEWS. Auditions were held on May 8, and the results came back soon. Matthew and Sophia would be in one show, and Melissa and I would be in the second. Soon after that, I was in the Spelling Bee. After about a half hour of words on the brain, I took home the first place trophy. I was in the paper for the TV program, and my picture was in it for the Science Fair. (I got third place in my category. ) Then it was April 11, the day of the TREASURE MASTER contest. I got the password from MTV. I ran down the street and played the video game through, and I would have won $10,000 if the password hadn’t been wrong. Then came the day when my REACH teacher announced that since our project won first place in the state Future Problem Solving Competition, we would go on an all-expense paid trip to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Man. I was psyched! On the trip the bus broke down, and we had to wait for another one to come from Chicopee. Then I could only go to the Aquarium and Quincy Market. NOT THE MUSEUM! At MIT, I farted on stage, and my picture of our plaque didn’t develop right. Then we got the phone call at school. We had made it to the National competition. Five, and only five of us were invited to the University of Wisconsin via plane for four days without parents for five days. Wouldn’t you know it, I wasn’t invited. I couldn’t get over it. I was the best in the REACH class. I knew it. Zachary kept rubbing in the fact that he could go, and I told him he would soon have a bad luck streak. His minor belief has started one, a little bit, And my bad luck seems almost over. Maybe I’ll be able to go to Wisconsin. But I doubt it. I’ll probably find out tomorrow. THE END? TO BE CONTINUED? 18 May 18, 1992. I didn’t find out. I just hope I’ll be able to go. It means too much to me for me to forget. Maybe I’ll look back at this and laugh, but I’d better not. 19 July, 1992. I didn’t go, but I got over it. I’m not laughing, though. Life’s better now. Nothing’s standing in my way, except for my parents, who’re always bugging the heck out of me. 20 I argued passionately for weeks that I wanted to go to the public middle school instead of a Catholic one. I had already argued my way out of attending Sunday school. 21 One day I locked myself in my room and turned up the volume on my CD player to drown out the arguing between my parents. After the yelling stopped I came out and asked my father where Mom had gone. He lay in front of the television, watching a documentary. He replied that she had gone to Memé and Pepé’s. (This was how we referred to my maternal grandparents. ) My mom was upset, he said. He had just barely sort of grazed her face with his hand and she’d made a big deal about it and said that he had hit her. I put on my shoes and ran down the street. My mom was talking to the family members who were there. Her family had never been very fond of my father. One Thanksgiving, he and Uncle Phil—my Mom’s sister’s husband—had entered a heated exchange originally over something having to do with the merits of higher education. Pepé had settled everything by punching my father so that he fell through the shelving in a doorway from the kitchen to the living room, knocking over the gumball dispenser. Gumballs had rolled and I had picked up one of the gumballs and my father had got up cussing with his hand to his bloody nose and pointed to me and said, “In front of my son!” but that had been years before. I was asked whether I wanted my father to leave the house. I asserted that I did. The police were called. Soon, he had removed his possessions. After that day, I began to refer to him as “Lenny” instead of as “Dad”. He hated that I did this. I persisted. 22 My mom gave our dog, Isis, away, because dog food was too expensive. We initially gave her to Lenny’s sister, but when Lenny found out, he got upset and demanded that they give the dog back to us. He thought that their other dog was going to hurt Isis, so we had to find someone else who would take her. 23 My mom started seeing Bruce, a truck driver. Years before, while making a delivery to the restaurant where Mom worked, Bruce had refused to move his truck to let her pick me up from school on time. I had stood in the schoolyard crying because of him. Now, suddenly, boom! He was living with us. But we still had to deal with my father. We screened our telephone calls, because he saw fit to dial us up between four and twelve times a day. On one particular day, when my mother was at work and I was home alone, a police officer knocked at the door. He said that my father had called to report that I had been left without a babysitter. I was thirteen. “I don’t see any problem with the fact that you’re home alone during the day at the age of thirteen,” the police officer said, “But we’re obliged to check out the situation when somebody places a call like this. ” 24 I started the seventh grade at Edward Bellamy Middle School. The culture I found myself in was quite a bit different and rougher than what I had grown used to in elementary school. Kids were often giving me trouble in class, but if I tried to ask a teacher to intervene the kid would deny that he had done anything, and his friends would back him up. In this way, by being a favorite victim, I also gained a reputation among some of my teachers as a troublemaker. 25 It didn’t help that I couldn’t stop laughing when Felix said funny things in class. Felix was a disruption, certainly, but I couldn’t help but laugh at his absurd jokes. It was said that he got away with more of this loud joking around than anyone else could because a condition kept him in a wheelchair with a shortened life expectancy. Felix and I arranged to meet up outside of school once, when the local Blockbuster Video held a video game competition. My mother seemed excited about this. I wasn’t sure whether she was excited specifically because she thought it was sweet that I would befriend a kid in a wheelchair, or if she just had noticed that I otherwise didn’t seem to have friends anymore. 26 I was taken aside and told that if I didn’t do homework more consistently I would be kicked out of REACH class and would need to go to Reading class instead. This threat was enough to make me start taking the assignments seriously, but my homeroom/science teacher advocated against me. As she reluctantly wrote out a hall pass for me one morning so that I could speak to the REACH teacher, she made as much clear to me: “I’m going to talk to that teacher about this. You don’t deserve to be in that class. ” So I was then introduced to Reading class. The woman who taught this subject was notorious for her tendency to break down crying when children were mean. When some kids made fun of Felix, she screamed that they were terrible little monsters and that it was wrong to ridicule someone with his condition. She fell to the side of his wheelchair, put her arms around him, and sobbed for a minute before running out of the classroom. 27 I often cried when I lay down for bed. I told my mother that it was difficult for me to sleep, because I knew that when I woke up I would need to go to school again. I wouldn’t call what I experienced bullying, exactly. It was just that whereas many of my elementary school classmates had come from military families housed on the local air force base, a majority of the kids in my overcrowded middle school (which was named, ironically, after an author made famous by his vision of how wonderful the America of my time was going to be) competed with each other to be the rudest, the least refined, the most able to bring about laughter at others’ expense. When I was physically accosted, my lack of resistance provoked bystanders to join in. Like a dozen students who for no particular reason took turns tripping me, shoving me, slapping me, spitting on me as I walked to my locker from recess. Or maybe it was hundreds, thousands. Or every child in the universe. Nobody was going to defend me, in any case. As I opened my locker, it was closed shut again by my head being slammed against it. I stumbled dizzily for a moment, but recovered myself when somebody asked me whether I was okay. Of course I was okay! Of course! And I opened my locker, took out the books that I needed for my afternoon classes and hurried away. Insecure, struggling for sense, what I would remember of these years was not necessarily going to be the most important, but certainly the most confusing times. Over the coming years, I was just going to pour more and more angst all over days that I might otherwise forget—recording over the analog tape. Middle school, version eight hundred thousand, two hundred seventy-five. 28 A girl in my class, a fellow loser, passed a note to me. It read that another girl liked me and wanted to meet me at the school dance so that she could “share her true feelings”. When the note-passer mouthed, “It’s true!” I was angry that she would play along with the mean kids. I had no doubt that this was a lie and a set-up. Still, that night, I stared at the note for a long time. I dreamed of what would be like to be liked. Other classmates had had their playground girlfriends and boyfriends, but not I. 29 Lenny/my father was living with my grandparents in the town of Paxton, Massachusetts, about an hour and a half away from Chicopee, Massachusetts, where I and my mom still lived. He drove to spend time with me once a week, when he would take me to buy newly released comic books. During one of these visits, he said that he would drive me back home without my comic books if I didn’t stand still to let him take a picture of me. It turned out that the point of his taking the picture was, in the battle for custody of me, to blame my increasing chubbiness and acne on my mother’s lack of parenting skills. 30 Undressing to go in the shower, I looked down at my body. I tried to imagine what it would be like not to have so much fat. Why was I so different? Difference meant attention; attention meant pain. On the other hand, I wasn’t shy. No, I regularly imagined the conversations that I would have if people were nice to me. Thinking such fanciful stories helped me to walk from the bus stop with a smile, watching the clouds. I, the kid who had always written stories, had always wanted to be a writer. But I didn’t dream of a better future. I only dreamed of a better today. 31 Although I hadn’t paid much attention to music on the radio until the previous summer—1993—by this Fall, Mom and Bruce had subscribed to cable television, and I had started to watch MTV. This was exciting: Lenny had always considered cable television to be an unnecessary expense, so the content was new to me. He had also told me that dirty, corrupting influences were available in the world and that they should be avoided at all costs. He cited heavy metal music and violent movies as examples of the filth that I should know to stay away from. 32 Mom suggested that I should change my style of dress. At the time, I didn’t like to wear jeans; I insisted that I wear only patterned, loose-fitting pants. I wore only tee shirts (usually having comic book characters on them) and the most plain-looking sweatshirts I could find. She and I walked through shopping malls to find new clothes for me, but everything seemed to be designed for certain types of people, none of which I could ever manage to be. To wear any of the clothes that I saw would have been a joke at my own expense. The boldest move I made in dressing myself was my Pearl Jam t-shirt. Another student once scoffed to see that I wore a shirt with the logo of a rock band—was I just being a poseur, trying to be cool?—but after he quizzed me on the name of the band’s lead vocalist, and I was able to reply, “Eddie Vedder, duh,” he left me alone. 33 My father had left me his word processing machine, the LED screen of which showed three lines of text at a time. Onto 3. 5” floppy discs I saved many of my first bits of teenage poetry. 34 Oct. 25, 1994. I’m sitting here in room #214 during second period and looking at the sheet describing what to write in this composition. My name is Levi, my nickname is Levi, and I’m thirteen years old. I live with my mother, because my father moved to South Carolina. That’s not anything negative, though, because I couldn’t stand him. I also have no brothers or sisters. I need to write about my hobbies, but I don’t know where to start! I collect and read comic books, as opposed to just collecting and not reading them. I also play video games, listen to music, watch the television, and hang out with my cousins, Chris and Ken, who live in Greenfield. You want me to brag? No problem! I took the SAT last year through a program I’ve forgotten the name to. I scored higher than the average college-bound 12th grade student on it, and I received a certificate for it. It wasn’t as hard as I had expected it to be. When it comes to video gaming, I’m also great. One major disappointment, though, came last summer when I entered a Blockbuster Video game tournament. I went there and had incredibly bad luck. I had never played the games as badly as I did there. I only wound up taking fifth place in the store, which was embarrassing. I went with my REACH group to M. I. T. In fifth grade, and the entire group delivered a speech about the community problem solving program we were receiving an award for. I like to hang out in malls, especially with my aforementioned cousins. How do I spend my free time?! I already covered that when I wrote about my hobbies! I like me because I’m cool. My best subjects are everything, and my worst subject is nothing. Well, actually, it depends on the teacher. In seventh grade my grades weren’t that great, but I was well behaved. My grades will be next to perfect this year, and yes, I hope to get out of Bellamy. "

    "body": "35 Craig walked down the halls of Bellamy Middle School next to me. He clapped his hands nervously together as we rushed toward class. “Man, I really want a cigarette right now,” he said, although I had never seen him smoke. He was among the kids with whom I was beginning to socialize. At night, from our respective bedrooms, Craig and I shared lengthy conversations about life, school, and music. When reports of the bombing in Oklahoma City were first showing on television, he called me up to confess that he was scared. Media speculation was suggesting that Islamic terrorists might have been involved in the bombing. Craig said that he felt like a kid who was afraid of monsters under the bed, except that it was Arabs under his bed whom he feared. He pronounced the word ay-rabs. 36 When my mom bought me a computer, I connected it to the Internet immediately. Around this time, the general population was just beginning to learn about email and the world wide web. I knew that this was the perfect technology for me: as a kid who wrote more easily than he spoke, I was excited by the idea of typing to others in real time. My first online friend was named Tricia. If I recall correctly, she lived in New Jersey. We met on the then-prominent Internet service, Prodigy. The payment plan for Prodigy provided thirty hours of access per month at a charge of $30. It was the least expensive plan I knew of. We met on a Prodigy bulletin board for the comic book, The Maxx. 37 My mom had been working, for a number of years, at a restaurant called Bernie’s Dining Depot. This restaurant was basically a diner connected to a renovated train car. My Pepé also worked at this restaurant. These connections got me my first job, as a bus boy. I stacked dishes. I emptied the contents of ashtrays into the paper place mats, which I then crumbled up for disposal. Waitresses tipped me out at the end of a shift. I was also paid a small hourly wage. But I wasn’t a very good employee. When I was scheduled to work, I would convince myself that I was sick, so that I would have an excuse not to go. When my Mom suggested that dishwashing might not be so bad as busing tables had been, I tried that, but the job was too much pressure and I didn’t like how the waitresses treated me. 38 Every morning at school, I wrote a new issue of Genocide: The Happy Paper. I passed it around to classmates. The newspaper, written on stapled sheets of notebook paper, included top ten lists, news articles, poetry, and the fan favorite, “Question of the Day”, for which I asked other kids stupid questions and wrote down their responses. I also wrote funny stories as extra credit assignments for my English class. My grade would have been much lower than the B that I ultimately received had it not been for the number of these that I handed in. 39 Jan. 4, 1995. A Day in the Life of a Jawbreaker. I’m bored. I mean really, really bored. I’ve been alive for only a couple of minutes, but I’m already bored. This laying down on a conveyor belt thing is really getting old. Yawn. OH MY GOD! What is that big awful thing?! I’m headed right for it—and I’m a piece of candy—I can’t move! NO! NO! NOOOOOO! I’m wrapped in plastic! Help! Help! I’m suffocating! I don’t wanna die! I’m only two minutes old! Waaait a minute. I thought the world was round. If it is, then WHY AM I ABOUT TO FALL OFF OF IT?! AAAA! OOF! Whoa. It’s dark in here. I guess it’s a box. Well, at least it’s an open box. Hey, who’s that guy? And… oh… LOOK AT ALL THESE DEAD JAWBREAKERS IN HERE! No! Don’t close the box! Please! No! Put away the tape! NOOOOOO! I guess I’m going to die, so I might as well do it in my sleep. Good night. Zzzz…. . Good morning. …. . …. . HEY! I’M ALIVE! And the box isn’t moving anymore! Cool! It’s still dark, though. Hey, did I hear what I think I did? YES! I’m being freed! The box is opening! Hi, little girl! Thanks for helping me! Oh, you want to pick me up and free me? Thanks! Oh! Thanks. That wrapper was horrible! Um… what are you… get me away from your mouth! NOOOOOOO! THE END 40 Feb 27, 1995. Ah, yes. Kindergarten. I remember it well. My teacher was Mrs. Slattery, who lived (and still does live) so close to my house that I would walk there to borrow books. I actually liked school during these innocent times. (It was 1986—I was five years old. Wow! It’s hard to believe that we’re already halfway through the ’90s—it’s incredible!) I remember the first day of school. Other kids were screaming and crying for mommy, and I was coloring pictures of Smurfs and trying to convince my mom that I wasn’t going to (how can I put this in a nice way? I guess I can’t) miss her. I really regret now that I enjoyed school back then, because to this day I have relatives who think I still like school nine years later. I was good enough at the three R’s to like school, though. In fact, I remember the first problem I ever got wrong on a paper. I kept insisting that someone messed up my paper, because I understood it well enough. I could read perfectly, and I went to a first grade reading class, but I still couldn’t tie my shoes. I was still perfect, of course, and I never misbehaved. Honestly! Ask Mrs. Slattery! First grade: I remember 1st grade well, too. I went to a 2nd grade reading class and was still a whiz at anything &amp; everything. My teacher was Mrs. Gravelin, and we had a student teacher, too, though I forget her name. I know she was in charge of the coolest thing about this year, though—the mailbox. We could write letters to classmates, drop it in the mailbox, and the letters would be delivered by a volunteer from the class or something. I remember something really interesting, too. There was a girl in the class who started sending love letters to me. Now, I’ve heard that girls mature faster than boys, but at six years old, girls were just people who weren’t boys to me. She would send me a letter shaped in the form of a heart, and I would try to make one in the shape of a mouth sticking out its tongue. (That was one of my first real sarcastic doings—many would follow. ) I think I learned to tie my shoes this year, but not until later in the year. Grades two and three: I don’t remember much that’s specific to second or third grade, so I’ll tell you a story from a year I can’t remember at Bowie. There was a contest to see who could get the closest guess to the number of jellybeans in a jar in the cafeteria. I got the number EXACTLY RIGHT, and I think it was a thousand and something. I wound up getting only about fifty, though, because my teacher made me share them with the entire class. I would have anyway, but I would have kept a little more for myself. I was the one who won it, RIGHT? Am I right or am I right? Fourth grade: Robbie and I combined our writing skills (I think it was this year) to write a story called “The Terrible Termite That Leveled Vermont”. The reason the termite didn’t total Texas was that Robbie figured that a termite would probably ravage a wooded area rather than the Alamo. Fifth grade: This wasn’t a very important year, but it set up a lot of the chain reaction that would knock down the dominoes of my future. (Cool analogy!) I found out that the world wasn’t 100% peachy keen, but my imagination and creativity still governed over a large part of my life. Nah, I won’t even get into the way my entire life was like a book or video game. I was immature, but a genius. Oh, yeah! I forgot something about fourth grade. I was the only kid from Bowie school to go to REACH class, but I got sick of going to an entirely different school one day a week at lunch, so I quit. In fifth grade I went to it, though, because it was in the school (which was Selser now), and most of my friends were in it. Sixth grade: Still in Selser, this was a pretty important year, setting up the earthshaking events of seventh grade. I started to do a really weird comic called “My World”. It really expressed my creativity. I also became more aware of the world and its dangers. I don’t know how to put this, really. I guess I grew up, mostly. The wonder, the fantasy world? That’s what disappeared. It helped me understand things better. Okay. Prepare yourself… here comes… Seventh grade: It’s hard for me to try to find excuses for this year, but… well, suffice it to say, my grades dropped. It’s, like, I wasn’t used to getting questions about little unimportant things, so I had to study. The first half of the year, I didn’t know that I had to. I wasn’t doing a lot of my homework, because I wasn’t used to having to keep track in my homework notebook, and I would always forget what I had. I was kicked out of REACH for this reason, despite the high quality of what work that I did turn in. The second half was weird. Mrs. Sittard, my homeroom and science teacher, saw how little effort I had been putting into things and decided that she didn’t like me. So, I didn’t like her. One day, a report was due and I was out sick on the day it was due. When I came back on the following school day, she didn’t let me turn in the report and I got a 0 for a double test grade. There went my grade for that term. Eighth grade: After 1994, the worst year of my life, eighth grade, particularly ‘95, is a breath of fresh air. I don’t have a real problem with any classes. Even though Mr. Warchol’s class is difficult, his nonlinear conversational form of teaching through thought rather than memorization is cool. I don’t know why he tries to be funny, though. Mrs. Safari with a k actually appreciates my style of writing, which is a lot more than I can say for any of my other old teachers. A bit too peppy at 8:45 in the morning, but not a bad teacher at all. That’s it! This long, epic, “War and Peace”-type thing is finished! At least, it is for now! 41 I still couldn’t sleep at night. After Mom and Bruce went to sleep, I turned on the television. I kept the volume at the lowest level possible. Mom still usually woke up and told me to go to bed, but I only waited for her to fall back to sleep and then turned on the television again. 42 The comic book The Maxx began to include a page of classified ads in each issue. I submitted an ad, which was included in issue #16. It stated that I hoped to begin an underground line of comic books under the label “Demented Press”. I invited interested creators to submit their work. I started to receive mail daily. The mailman learned that envelopes addressed to Demented Press belonged to me. I taped the letters of response to the wall above my bed. I wrote a script for my own book and sent it to a collaborator for illustration, but he never finished the first issue. 43 As I walked from the bus to my house after school, I always walked quickly, so that I was far ahead of the other students and away from interactions like: “Are you Michael Jackson?” “…” “Hey! I’m talking to you! Are you Michael Jackson?” “No. I’m not Michael Jackson. I don’t dance around grabbing my privates. ” “Privates? What are you, 5 years old? You can’t say cock?” “Fine! Cock!” (Laughter) Now, when I felt isolated, I could think to myself: They don’t know me. I have bigger and better things to think about. I’m starting a line of comic books. It was somewhat like the feeling of pride that I had experienced a few years back when, having anchored a couple of episodes of Chicopee School News on the cable access channel, somebody from another school once stopped me in the mall and said, “Hey, didn’t I see you on TV?” I knew fully well that it was silly of me to feel proud about this, but I did anyway. 44 None of the students who took part in my school’s production of Annie were friends of mine, but I was still excited to see the show. Although my school was a couple of miles away, I walked there and back just to be in the audience. The idea that my peers could be involved in such a work amazed me. I wondered what it would be like to do theater… but I also categorically avoided all extra-curricular activities, figuring (based on experience) that the other kids would laugh and work to make me miserable if I tried to be included in any activity that required teamwork. The morning after I attended that performance of Annie, my Social Studies teacher, Mr. Warchol, decided to make an example of me. I had left an empty Dr. Pepper bottle on the floor of the school’s hallway; he put me on trial for this crime. I was terribly embarrassed and also angry at him. My responses to his questions were flippant. I suggested that he maybe he should stop attacking me and to get back to teaching class. 45 Then there was a field trip to some place in Connecticut. There was a field and a swimming pool. Carnival games were free, and we were able to play them until we won a prize. I earned a blue teddy bear from one of these games and named it Pancreas. I was too ashamed of my weight to take off my shirt for the swimming pool. Craig talked about how exciting it was to see the girls in their swimsuits. I didn’t like talking about the girls that way, so I tried to change the subject. We said mean things to the R2D2-like robot who wheeled around. On the bus ride home, Craig asked, “Do you like…” and then used an ethnic slur. “What’s a ___?” I asked. “You know, a Hispanic. Like a Puerto Rican. ” “Um. Sure, I don’t know why I wouldn’t. ” This was another scene that I would play back in my head over and over again, trying to understand. “Are you sure you want to do this?” the woman in the school’s front office asked. Ha. Ha. Yes, I was sure. "

    "body": "46 The summer after middle school ended, I was invited to a party. Four kids in the living room blasted The Smashing Pumpkins’ “Bullet with Butterfly Wings” and attempted to start a mosh pit among themselves. I hung around with one boy I sort of knew, but then he found a girl who seem to like him in that way boys and girls were supposed to like each other. I figured they wanted to be alone once they ran away from me and hid together in the bushes. At some point in the night I and several other kids were standing in the road until a car approached. Trying to be funny, I ran back in the road after everyone had moved out of the way. The car turned out to be a police car. The officer stopped and called to me, “Hey, you,” he said, “Don’t be an asshole. ” I apologized and said that I had just been fooling around. “Well, it’s not funny. I don’t like you,” he said. “You don’t like me?” I echoed, not understanding where that comment was coming from. “I don’t like you,” he repeated, then drove on. 47 I felt grossed out at the tone of my friend Timothy’s voice when he showed me the issue of Playboy hidden in his desk drawer. I was seeing all around me that there was a new desperation in the way teenagers talked; their bids for acceptance always seemed so loud to me. It was the same tone of voice that Craig had used to talk about the girls in swimsuits. There was an intense longing in the way these fourteen-year-old boys talked about sexuality. It was an intense longing—not for sex with women, but for fraternity with other boys. What were they convincing themselves that they saw when they looked at a naked lady? Certainly it wasn’t a human being. 48 Aaron, on the other hand, didn’t seem desperate at all. For a while, after being friends in grade school, we had drifted away from each other, but new life had been breathed into our friendship by a shared interest in computers. By all outward appearances he was content with his family and derived the bulk of his personal satisfaction from tinkering with technology and software. I remember that we and his cousin went to a roller skating rink one night, to play “laser storm”. We divided into teams and shot at our opponents through manufactured fog. Over the course of the night, a dark-haired girl kept catching my eye. As it turned out, she and the girl she was with approached our group. We were invited to play a game called “Suck and Blow”. To their surprise, we weren’t familiar with the game. Somebody took a business card, put it to their mouth, and inhaled so that it stuck to their lips. They then passed it to the lips of the next participant, somebody of the opposite sex. The girls asked for our phone numbers at the end of the night. We were surprised when they called the next day, while we were all still at Aaron’s house. They arranged for us to meet at the roller skating rink the following week, although Aaron’s cousin wasn’t going to be able to come. We met at the roller skating rink, as scheduled. The dark-haired girl asked me to join her for the “couples skate”, which, for some reason, was the Michael Jackson song “Childhood”. We skated, holding hands. For some reason, though, we never saw each other again. 49 I lost weight during this time, as it became more acceptable for me to leave the house frivolously. Seizing upon my freedom to wander, I spent most afternoons walking, or riding my bicycle, around the neighborhoods in my vicinity. I rode to Blockbuster Video, walked through the aisles for a long time and rented nothing. Then I rode to the comic book store, browsed for a long time and bought nothing. When I walked, I would typically take a path through the woods that separated my neighborhood from a little park with a baseball field, a basketball court, and a drinking fountain that had not worked in years. I didn’t encounter many other people when I walked, but I was cawed at by plenty of crows on telephone wires. My mother asked me to be honest with her—was I in a gang? Was I doing drugs? She found it difficult to believe that I was honestly devoting this much time to simply wandering alone. 50 My interest in comic books had stemmed from an interest in superheroes but quickly branched out. When I found out that Neil Gaiman, the writer of the Sandman series, was going to do a reading of stories at the Academy of Music in Northampton, I bought tickets for that and for the reception afterwards at the Words &amp; Pictures museum. It may have been more than just a coincidence that my predilection for black clothing demonstrated itself soon after this day. 51 I don’t remember exactly what provoked me to abandon Demented Press. My reasoning, I think, was that I didn’t have the money to spend on photocopies. I suddenly stopped responding to the letters that I received. 52 I started growing out my hair. If I could think of myself as serious and intense, I thought, then maybe my peers would leave me alone. 53 Rooney’s, the clothing store that belonged to my Aunt Brenda and Uncle Dave, had been struggling. There was more space in the building than they knew what to do with. With the excited backing of my cousins Chris and Ken, a corner of the second floor of this space became dedicated to the sale of comic books. It was called, with my reluctant approval, Gen X Comix. For about a year, then, my collection of back issues was kept in an area of the second floor of the store. I probably earned about $50 total from the venture; I lost quite a bit more than that in stolen merchandise. 54 Aaron taught me to write computer programs in BASIC. We used the computer microphone to record and manipulate wave files. He gave me a copy of GUStalk, which synthesized speech from written text. By writing an original batch file and setting it to run from autoexec. bat, I customized my computer to vocalize absurd things whenever I turned it on. I also made certain that if I became angry with the computer while it was in DOS mode I could type a number of taunts into it, to which it would know how to respond. 55 Jason had been a friend of mine in the sixth grade. During our two years at Bellamy, however, we had only spoken once or twice. When we found ourselves in conversation near the start of the ninth grade, he immediately asked me whether I owned a computer. When he learned that I did, the awkwardness that had characterized our interactions during middle school suddenly disappeared. He gave me the access phone numbers to local BBSs and suggested games for me to download. We talked about programming. He scoffed to hear that I was still programming in BASIC. He was writing code in C and Pascal, while hoping to find a C++ compiler on the local BBSs. Jason was in my World History class. The teacher was young, in her twenties. We could tell that she had never taught a class of her own before. On the first day of class she stood before us, professionally dressed and self-assured, to assert that we would be given a quality education no matter what and that she wasn’t going to tolerate horseplay. We in the seventh period class then had a good view of what I liked to think of as the slow crushing of a new teacher’s soul. As the school year progressed her eyes became increasingly glazed, her lectures became shorter, and she spent longer amounts of time slouched behind her desk. Jason and I sat in the rear of the classroom. For our part we were reasonably well-behaved but on certain days couldn’t help making snide comments in our shared dialect of nonsense. Our exchanges, comprised of in-jokes and jargon, were usually impenetrable to other students, so when Cynthia began to sit near us and to talk with us we didn’t quite know how to react. Although I had seen Cynthia around since we’d been in grade school, I had never known much about her. I remembered her as quiet. In her bookbag she kept a tin box of pencils from the art supply store. She worked on a sketch of Geddy Lee that was based on a photo from the inside sleeve of a Rush cassette. I wasn’t familiar with the music of Rush. They were her favorite band. Most frequently she drew dragons or other fantasy creatures. Other students paid her for these detailed pencil sketches, which took her weeks to finish. It took an offhand comment from her for me to realize that she Black. “How did you not know that?” she asked me. “I had a big Afro all through elementary school!” But I was never very good at processing visual information, and she was lighter-skinned than many of the other Black kids I knew. 56 I had taken advantage of trial offers for every Internet service provider I could find. Already it was a ritual that I checked my email when I returned home from school. Somehow in my online wanderings I found myself at a web site called Ferndale, an interactive entertainment project based out of Los Angeles. Its plot was something like a fictional version of MTV’s The Real World: each day, a log of new events in the household was posted, along with bulletin board messages by the characters. During designated hours actors entered an America Online (AOL) chat room and portrayed the characters. Ferndale didn’t seem to be catching on, but I frequented the chat room and kept the actors company. The one other regular was a woman in her early thirties named Susan, who was the personal assistant for an unrelated television actress. Susan talked to me about married life and what it was like to raise a daughter. I talked to her about high school and what it was like to walk on icy sidewalks for hours without destination. Susan and I were both rewarded for our loyalty to the Ferndale project: designated chat room moderators, we were given free “overhead” AOL accounts. Not being charged by the hour for Internet access put me in a position to become an Internet addict, back when few could afford to maintain such an addiction. Soon, I was familiar with the range of chat rooms in the “arts and entertainment” category of member-created AOL chats. More than all the others, I frequented the Smashing Pumpkins room. While I already listened to this popular rock band, socializing with other fans on a daily basis made it so that I began to listen to them constantly. 57 Cynthia liked to hang out in the cool English teacher’s room after school. She joined the debate team, of which he was the coach. I started to tag along, too. I wasn’t on the team—and as it turned out Cynthia had missed some essential meetings so she didn’t do any debates, either—but we acted as though we were part of the team and we took the bus to schools in nearby towns like South Hadley and West Springfield. We watched other peoples’ debates and talked to other kids. The people we met at other schools were very friendly—shockingly friendly. I began to realize that not everywhere was like Chicopee, and that in fact, each town was quite a bit different from the next. I got happy and gregarious and for fun I shook hands with random students. This was especially nice because I felt like I wouldn’t see them again. I was excited when I met the guy in the “Born Again Pagan” shirt, the first other person I ever met who listened to Tori Amos. He and I talked about our interpretations of song lyrics and how it was a big regret of mine that I had missed her show in Springfield in 1995 on the Dew Drop Inn Tour. 58 I got my first guitar for Christmas when I was fifteen, I think. It was an inexpensive Peavey brand electric. I taught myself how to play by finding transcriptions of songs as tablature on the Internet. I never really learned how to play many songs in their entirety, but once I knew how to play certain parts I could piece together my own little riffs. I only really wanted to play so that I might be able to write songs of my own someday. "

    "body": "59 Regulars of the Smashing Pumpkins chat room were assigned articles of clothing. Primarily these were articles of singer/guitarist Billy Corgan’s wardrobe: Pants, Shirt, Socks. A couple of people ended up being the clothes of the other band members. I never was assigned an article of clothing: people suggested the idea sometimes, but LeviAdams was already a cool enough name. When somebody new wanted to be an article of clothing, it had to be approved by several of the other articles of clothing, with Pants having the final say. Maxine, for example, had originally been Shirt, but she took over as Pants when the original Pants disappeared for awhile. The old Pants later returned and tried to reclaim the title, but failed to wrest it away from Maxine. Socks took a liking to me from the night when we first chatted. As time passed, things between Socks and I became romantic. It’s a tough thing to explain to someone who wasn’t there, just how two teenagers in the mid-1990’s on this new amazing thing called the Internet could think that a relationship with some faraway person they had never met was a good idea. You just had to be there, to see the letters and the scribbles and to know the loneliness of what was supposed to be home. Your notebooks were those spiral 3 subject things that Mom would buy you for school. The notes that were class-related got ripped out so as not to disrupt the flow that you could see between the lines when you looked over your chicken scratch. The words weren’t any cry for recognition. They weren’t intended to set you up for a career or to gain you prestige. They were your own creations, yes, but the real satisfaction came when you finished something and then took it in. That was meaningful because you had learned that when words were placed in order on a page it was because they were beautiful that way. The words that you wrote took, for the first time, those pieces of yourself that you feared and made them beautiful. Finally you could see that once-frightening pieces of yourself could in fact be seen in a different way. (Laughter is pain. Your peers want to take something from you that you’re not even sure that you have anymore. Your body tenses when another kid is passing you, because that way, if they hit you, you won’t be winded, you’ll be able to just keep on walking. Then you get a package in the mail. There are stick figures on the envelope. Inside are several pages of notebook paper. The edges all have been carefully torn at the perforation. The handwriting isn’t like yours at all. It was written with some kind of gel pen. Where did she buy pens like that? In a world very much different from the city in which you’re growing up. ) The pictures of her were not taken for the purpose of being shown to you, but still they ended up being given to you. And there they were, yours and yours alone. You could put these pictures inside your desk drawer and look at them every now and again, when you needed to see the face of someone who would care for you. A thousand miles might as well have been the distance to the moon, but even from such a distance, a picture made it seem real. It was the most proof you had ever found that human things like love could be possible for you, too: contents of the jar revealed! Pay the price of admission and see the insignificant wonders that are there to see. Knife driven over and over and over and over into the difficult pickle jar, finally it could not withstand the pressure anymore. Tall trees toppling over, domino orgy wondering how they could possibly have withstood the test of time apart, then reflecting upon it and deciding that they never could have and never did. Force of gravity overcoming the initial driving force of the universe, child of beauty coming home to me. I love you as you set it free, I’m wonderful as you let me be. Funeral march playing to the elephant and the donkey, to the black and to the white, to the establishment of the obscurity. If you don’t understand that’s because it’s verbatim. If you do understand then it’s meaningless. You meat me down by the bay where the watermelons grow, but not in the command center of Atlantis. And for this, know that I love you. There is no self but what one finds in others… and if one chooses to deny their self that privilege of un-individuality, then they can only seek to find solace in the one thing which can possibly be considered solely theirs—emotion. Emotion being a convoluted stew of nonsense, to be arranged in whatever way. Love is desire, love is an aim, a goal, an ideal… to receive love is a miracle. I was still only fifteen. Socks was seventeen. She sent me books: Desolation Angels by Jack Kerouac; Brave New World by Aldous Huxley; Naked Lunch by William S. Burroughs. It seemed to me that I inspired her writing, except that my writings were serious and dramatic, while hers were often (caustically) humorous. (The selfish love of feeling good brings forth relationships not based on what the significant other is, but instead the love that makes one feel so wonderful… making everything else seem so magnificently pointless, and yet paving the way for disagreement and separation… and the whole time, making the other wonder infinitely… how? I only wonder at the futility of trying. It’s the trying that makes it worthwhile, as opposed to the outcome, but nonetheless it’s unlike the walking of a million miles for a crushing of the self and for the wonders of eternal salvation… no, it’s walking blindfolded for a million miles, knowing that somewhere along the line one will find purgatory. Is there a point? Of course not, other than that there is no point. Is there a point to the point that there is no point?) Domino orgy sticking its fingers in its ears and trying desperately not to hear us our voice our love the everything as we look around, having found another nothing to wish for, nothing to want. On the phone with Socks, kneeling in the hallway while I had the house alone to myself. She was saying something about how she used to have a boyfriend, but she later admitted that she had made that story up. And as quickly as things had started to get romantic, they stopped, and we were “just friends” again. We still talked a lot, but the tone of things was different. Then there was Ryan, who started hanging around the Smashing Pumpkins room. He replaced Maxine as Billy Corgan’s Shirt. He had high quality scans of several photos of himself smiling, almost smirking, wearing bold colors of lipstick. And he wanted drive up from Pennsylvania to visit me. 60 I walked through the woods and cut through the Joseph Preston Park to get to the Ames Department Store. I didn’t find Ryan outside or near the entrance. I walked through the store but still didn’t see him. Finally he was there, looking at a pamphlet that advertised books of Dr. Seuss. To be loved to be loved to be loved to be just a friend it is wonderful. And the rest don’t matter… I look. I often look. And I scream inside while I begrudgingly make eye contact with the love of my life for that instant. To turn left, to turn right, and to nod, and to stand frozen in the place as you know that the world is so deep a chasm, and yet so bare… so naked… so freezing in the vast winters, to love them and to know that it is real, to know that there is more to life than population control and free love. He hugged me. We had talked about this in advance, that he would hug me. The day so far had pretty much consisted of my running the notion of such an opportunity through my head, endlessly: He’s going to hug me! I’m going to get a hug! We were awkward at first: fidget, fidget. Then we went to the car. He played some music, I forget what. The Smashing Pumpkins, probably. I may have rolled the window down. He had found the motel that I’d told him about. I suggested that we might go to the Hampshire Mall, in the town of Hadley. I kept forgetting whenever it came time to say “Okay, take a turn here,” because I wasn’t used to giving people driving directions. Nuh-uh infinity plus one equals the omnipresent collective mind that breaks down your door and decides what it’s going to say after the fact. After wandering the mall for a while we went back and forth, saying what do you want to do, what do you want to do, and finally we just went back to his motel room. Was I spending the night? I think I may have been, because Mom and Bruce had happened to be going to a Wynonna Judd concert that night. I remember the initial impressions. It was a slow and subtle progression. Every nonverbal signal had to be signed in triplicate. His hand moving up my back. I don’t remember much about scent, except breath. Maybe I remembered the feel of another’s breath from childhood, when I would be held by family. “So that’s what it’s like to have your tongue in someone else’s mouth. ” “It’s weird!” “Yeah. ” I skipped school the next day to go with him to New York City, which was about three hours away. We parked at a convenience store in New Jersey and waited for a couple of Internet friends of ours to pick us up and drive us into the city. It was a bumpy ride. In the back seat, both Ryan and I were feeling sick. Still, though, we were lying on each other and kissing while the others said “Aww!” We went to Planet Hollywood, where the food was expensive. Our friends told us stories about Smashing Pumpkins concerts. That was how we all knew each other, of course, was through the America Online Smashing Pumpkins chat room. Back in Chicopee, I called my mother from the Fairfield Mall to say that hey, I’m over at Jason’s house and I’m thinking of staying over. But she knew. She said “Well, I’ll be right over there to pick you up. ” I had Ryan rush to drop me off in front of Jason’s house, but still when my mother confronted me on the matter I admitted that yeah, I hadn’t been at Jason’s, I hadn’t gone to school that day, I had been with that kid from the Internet she had told me couldn’t come visit, and we had gone to New York City. Before going back inside the house we sat in our driveway, in the parked car, and she cried a little: “I’ve never been to New York City in my life. ” She had gone through my room and found one of Ryan’s letters that he had written to me referencing this visit. So, my mother and I reached an agreement: I wouldn’t keep secrets like this from her if she understood that there would be things I would do with or without her permission. Ryan came over and met my mom. My mom said he seemed okay. It was still a bit awkward, of course. The next time I hung out with Cynthia, it took me awhile to actually tell her about the whole Ryan thing. That was just how private I was. I remember that she seemed a little offended that I was her friend but hadn’t told her any of it. And… yeah. I was a weird kid. 61 My American Government teacher, who was also the football coach, disliked me. I was unhappy that I couldn’t sleep in his class. (He embarrassed me when I tried. ) He handed out “study sheets” with all the answers to the tests on them, then said that it was an open notebook test. I lost the notes in my disorganized backpack and still earned good grades on the tests, until he stopped giving me credit for answers that weren’t copied word-for-word from the notes. I approached him and said “I got the answer right. I used the same words that you wrote in the notes and everything. I just structured the sentence differently. ” “Well, I gave you notes. You should have used them. ” “But you’re basically saying that ‘The first president was George Washington’ would be right, but ‘George Washington was the first president’ would be wrong!” “Yes, in my class, that’s exactly right. Go back to your seat. ” One of his football players laughed at me. (How many times must I scream into the night that I am not a Catholic, that I never was a Catholic, that my father was never a Catholic, that it’s all just a horrible chain letter that doesn’t really date back to 1887? Wind me up before you send me out into the oncoming traffic and I’m positive I will find my way across the street to the child of beauty who awaits me there… I never did actually get around to finishing that role-playing game that Jason and I were programming. I never did get around to finishing that “understanding the truth about everything” thing, either… I really just want to spread kindness and love and all that other sappy stuff. ) 62 There were two gym classes. One was the more competitive class, which most of the boys took; one was the less competitive one, which most of the girls took. I took the girly class, but I still got made fun of while playing volleyball. (I wonder how they can support a thing that glamorizes putting time and effort into doing your best to crush others. My only competition is myself. ) 63 Jason, Cynthia and I had to sneak past teachers in the hallway when the school canceled the final period of classes for a mandatory pep rally. We felt that we had a moral obligation not to participate in such bullshit. We split up and each made our way out through the first unguarded exit we found. (I will never have a high school diploma, because everyone has such a fear of education. ) 64 For Christmas Cynthia bought everyone she knew various books by Ayn Rand. Over the course of my time knowing her she convinced me to read three or four of this author’s books. I was reading about two novels a week at this point, because what else was I going to do during class? (To never shut up simply because someone said so, not to care that they want to pretend the Constitution does not truly exist for the youth of America, that the young are only symbols to be used to gain money, support, sex, bad one-liners to use at campaign rallies. Maybe this is all nothing. Maybe this is poetic. Maybe these words will be burned and denounced as heretical. Maybe these words will be misinterpreted and misquoted. It just makes too much sense to ignore. To be happy at the words which they could never understand, only to be happy at the fact that never will they have to learn. To be an idiot, to die, never to learn, never to stop laughing at nothing in particular. This is a high school classroom?) 65 I approached someone at school—I think my guidance counselor. I said that this school system wasn’t working for me. I needed to be challenged and I felt alienated from my peers. Were there any alternatives? Was homeschooling a possibility? No, he said, there were no alternatives, I couldn’t homeschool without someone to teach me who had themselves graduated from high school. (I had no such adult in my life, or at least none local to me. ) And no, he said, if I took a GED test to prove high school equivalency I wouldn’t be able to go to community college until I was eighteen. 66 I was too busy reading, writing or sleeping to pay any attention in geometry class. Eventually the teacher stopped bothering to hand me tests. I was given “demerits” when I skipped gym class to go to the library or when I refused to stop reading books during a movie. After 15 demerits they demanded that I stay for detention. I never went to detention, so at that point I would be suspended for a couple of days. 67 I stopped going to high school about one month before I turned sixteen. If my mother tried to force me into going I would simply leave the house and not return home until after school hours. I ignored the calls that threatened me with truancy officers and went through the official paperwork for dropping out as soon as my birthday came around. “Are you sure you want to do this?” the woman in the school’s front office asked. Ha. Ha. Yes, I was sure. "

    "body": "1 I’m sitting here with a cup of soda that I have to use because they hate it when I drink out of the bottle even though I can finish off a two liter in a short enough span of time so that it really shouldn’t make any difference, since once I’ve claimed a two liter of soda for myself it’s basically finished and done for. Of course, they also hate the fact that I drink so much soda, but I don’t really care… Maybe if they had any reasonable supply of food here I’d have something to eat to occupy my time and my tummy. Of course, that’s probably a miserable lie, since I’d need something to wash down such food anyway. I really don’t understand why they never buy any soda, even though it’s the drink I love most. I drink as much Kool-Aid as I would soda, but I love soda so much more. Maybe they think that I should drink something more healthy than soda… though, I don’t really think Kool-Aid is exactly a healthy, get-you-going-in-the-morning-with-all-the-essential-vitamins kind of drink. 2 I mean, come on—I could yell at the television screen for a half hour as that guy from Charles in Charge tries to juggle between two dates that he’s set up for the same night. I could just yell out to him, “What the fuck’s your problem?! Neither of them obviously mean much to you, if all you want to do is get through the night without losing your sense of masculinity. If they wouldn’t want what you could offer them honestly, stop wasting their time! They should be let free to find the kind of person they would be compatible with. ” But no one seems to appreciate honesty very much. All they wish for is the feeling of perfection. Love is friendship and friendship is love and if you think you have one without the other you just have a pathetic shadow that you’re holding onto, dragging its physical self along for the ride. So I just say, follow your heart where such matters of the heart shall lead you! Follow your mind as it leads you to the path of greater love and hope and, overall, happiness! And most importantly, don’t bother yourself with watching Charles in Charge reruns. It’ll just wind up pissing you off. 3 I have two guitars in my room. One of them’s named Trendy—she’s an electric… one of them’s named Broken—she’s an old classical-style acoustic that used to be my uncle’s until he left it over here years ago, so we got it restrung and now is decent enough to play on. I’ve been playing for six months… I went and took one lesson, but it was an insult to my intelligence and much too expensive, so I decided to learn on my own… everything I know about guitar now I learned off of Internet tablature. I need to get some books so I can learn about theory and such, though… I mean, I have a few songs, but they’re just sad acoustic stuff… I know nothing about scales or anything, so I really have to work on that. I really doubt I’ll ever be in a band or anything, but I think I could do it well if I did… 4 At family events I would feel alone, somehow fundamentally different from everyone else. The conversations around me all seemed stupid. I felt left out and, as a result, angry. Because I had been molded in large part by my father (who had often been judgmental of my mother’s family) it was easy for me to retreat during a holiday gathering and to hide somewhere, reading, feeling trapped, mumbling, “My family is so stupid!” So long as I continued to believe that objectively I was “different” I would need to pit myself against the world, with either myself or the world playing the hero. And of course I was going to be the hero: I was still Superkid! I still flew above everyone else. My job was to set the world right. 5 I’m going to South Carolina a week from tomorrow. Yup, I’m going to visit my daddy down there. I guess it’s a good idea for me to choose torture over monotony… after being stuck with my not-so-fun daddy for nine days, without a computer and without a guitar, I figure that suddenly being alone and forgotten here in my room will start looking quite nice. At least that’s the plan. Meanwhile, I’m making a video tape for Socks. It’s in exchange for the Smashing Pumpkins’ import single for “The End is the Beginning is the End” that she picked up for me. I gave her both of the SP concerts that I have, plus Fiona Apple unplugged, some stuff from the one They Might Be Giants video I have, and the Tori Amos concert for RAINN… plus the They Might Be Giants “Lincoln” CD that’s just sitting around since I got the “Then: The Earlier Years” compilation, which has that entire album and lots of other stuff on it. 6 Spending time with my father in South Carolina was unbearable. I switched my flight home to an earlier one. I think I only stayed for three or four days instead of the planned nine. 7 Ryan, a number of months after his first visit, came to visit again. This time, because my mom knew about him, he was able to stay in the house, sleeping on the couch at night. When no one else was in the home, we rolled around on the floor, touching each other’s bodies with our hands. Also, we went to the Big E—the Eastern States Exposition, a regional fair—for the purpose of seeing “Weird Al” Yankovic in concert. We got there early to get seating. When we left, it was late. We rode a shuttle bus back to where we had parked. I remember that during this visit I became moody and demanded time alone, even though he only visited for maybe a week. I would lock myself in my room, then, as I chatted with other people online. Things weren’t entirely bad on this visit, but they were awkward, mostly due to my being a jerk. After the visit, we were more distant. Before, we always waited online for the other to sign on. We would talk to our mutual online friends about how we really hoped that the other would show up in the chat room. But at some point I told him that it didn’t make sense to keep it up. It seemed like he was investing more in it than I was. 8 Another person I knew through the America Online chat rooms and spoke with frequently was a girl from Bakersfield, California. Her name was V. She maintained an email poetry zine. I thought her poetry was amazing. 9 I was just talking to V. a bit. I was trying to convince her that writing out one’s thoughts is basically the key to self-understanding, realization of the ways your mind works, where you’ve been, where you’re going… because you can’t hide from what you’ve written. And thoughts are so easily changed to suit a theory that you might be going over in your mind. 10 Maxine is another friend left over from the good old days when everyone in the Smashing Pumpkins room knew each other and could laugh and just fool around, and if an idiot came in we could just laugh at them and get them pissed off enough so that they’d leave. Maxine somehow met up with Jason, my friend in real life, and the two hit it off. Um, the only problem with this was that Jason felt… I don’t know… embarrassed, I guess… about the entire situation. And so they didn’t tell me about any of this. I just had to learn about it through word of mouth, mostly Socks. Even when they arranged to meet in real life, and have Maxine spend a week over at Jason’s house, they didn’t tell me. On the second day when she was there, though, Cynthia and I were on our way walking to the mall and decided to stop in to see Jason. Cynthia knew that Maxine was there but had been instructed not to tell me. I knew that she was there, but I didn’t feel that it would be a good idea to start a conversation about it, because I knew the fact that I wasn’t supposed to know she was over would come up… and… well… I don’t know. Anyway, we went over there, and Jason stood at the door for a minute before reluctantly letting us into his room, where Maxine was sitting down, staring at the floor. Jason sat down on the couch, and then we all just kind of sat there. Maxine refused to even look at me, and Jason wouldn’t say a word. Cynthia made an effort to start some conversation, but nothing happened. Eventually I just said, “Fine, thanks for the warm welcome” and left with Cynthia. I don’t like the feeling of not being trusted. I don’t know if Jason felt that I wouldn’t… understand… or that I felt that he should be incapable of actually caring for someone… or that I would feel strangely about the fact that they’re both my friends. If there’s one thing I’d like to think is obvious, it’s my understanding of other people. Obviously, I wouldn’t make fun of them or anything. Anyway, I just felt kind of betrayed in this situation. Well, maybe not betrayed, but disappointed, because this proves he doesn’t feel he can share with me. The next day they apologized and invited me over. I said I would get them out of the house, since they hadn’t actually done anything. We walked to the mall… but they stayed quiet. Jason seemed even quieter than usual. 11 It seems pretty definite that there won’t be any problems interfering with my starting classes at HCC (Holyoke Community College) in the Spring semester (which actually begins in January). If something fell out of the sky at this point that obstructed the path that seems so obviously cleared towards my actual future, I would quite honestly be devastated. I really don’t think I could stand much more time in the state that I’ve been in lately, which has been just like replaying the same old boring movie over and over again every time I wake up. It is not overall a worse situation than I was in when I was back in high school, so even forgetting about the fact that dropping out was a shortcut to some actual brilliant light in my life, I regret nothing at all about the way I handled that situation. It was an incredibly awkward time in my life and I’m glad to be rid of it. I’m starting college at sixteen, but it seems to be a long overdue advancement. The days that at first seemed to flow so quickly together with all their monotonous drudgery now seem, when I look back on them, and even as I exist in the present tense and the recent past, to have brought about an aging much more quickly than I would have been able to accomplish had my mind been subjected to the shit that was being thrust upon it with every minute I spent at that place. I was really in a cloud of anger, sadness, frustration, every negative emotion you could honestly think think of while I was still in school. 12 When I have things to experience within my own life, I will be one interesting human being. I can feel what it’s like already. “Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?” “Ohhh, tomorrow’s kind of a busy day. I kind of have to get in touch with so-and-so and see if we’re going to be doing such-and-such then or on Thursday… I’m still not sure yet. Why, what did you want to do?” “I thought it’d be neat to do blah-blah-blah. ” “Ah, that sounds neat! Well, I can’t make any real definite plans at this point, but we’ll just have to see what happens, okay?” 13 I went to see Fiona Apple in concert. I arrived at the John M. Greene Hall at Smith College in Northampton. It was very early—afternoon—and so I scoped out the area. I saw a catering truck. I said hello to the man who cooked inside of it and asked what he was doing. He replied that he was catering the show. That sounded interesting, I said. He asked me if I wanted a soda. I said sure. He asked what kind. I said that I wanted a Dr. Pepper. He gave one to me. I hopped into the truck to inspect what he was doing. He said that I couldn’t be in there. I apologized and walked away. I paced around slowly, then. I wasn’t sure what I was doing. A girl was sitting on the steps. She said hello and asked if I was there for the Fiona Apple concert. I said that I was. She said that we must be the first ones, that we were wicked early. We sat and talked for a little. I said that I would be attending Holyoke Community College the following semester. I think she said that she had gone there before, but that she wasn’t sure whether she would be going back. She had made an audio cassette of her poetry; she wanted to give it to Fiona. A bus pulled in, but this girl I was talking to was getting hungry. She asked me if I was hungry, too. I said that sure, I could eat. I asked if she knew where this certain pizza place was, because I had won a gift certificate to it through a radio contest. She knew where it was. I said that could we share the free pizza. We went around back to the back of John M. Greene Hall. People were getting out of the bus. I think they were Fiona’s band. The girl stopped one of them and asked if he’d be able to give these to Fiona. He said that he would. We ate the pizza and walked back to the venue, into the show. We had separate seats. I never saw—or, more likely, never recognized her again. 14 Later in the year, Maxine visited Jason again. Her hair had grown out and been dyed red. She seemed to talk more this time. Jason’s mother let Maxine (the only one among us with a license) drive her car. We attempted to go to the Holyoke Mall, but this was during the Christmas season. In the parking lot, navigating small spaces with lots of cars surrounding her, trying to find a parking spot, she freaked out. Exasperated, she said we were going back to Jason’s house instead. Along with presents for Jason and Cynthia, I bought Maxine some stuff for Christmas. I got her a Lou Reed cassette and, I don’t know, something else. She didn’t thank me, just said, “Oh”, which made me sad. 15 Then it was the turning of the new year to 1998. I decided that this would be a nice opportunity to have my first ever New Year’s Eve experience outside of my home. So, New Year’s Eve Day, I got in touch with Maxine and Jason to say that we should go to Northampton. There were “First Night” events: you could buy a button and go to events around town, and there was a whole countdown thing in the street. Cynthia happened to call Jason before we left, so she ended up coming along. The night was very cold. We ran from place to place. We saw The Drunk Stuntmen, a local band. I gave the band’s singer an Atomic Fire Ball from my pocket while he was up on the chair next to me, rocking out during a cover of David Bowie’s “Suffragette City”. We bought candy from Sweetie’s. We were wandering around, not really knowing the town. Maxine led us into an auto repair shop, where some people were just hanging out. They let us stand in there for warmth and, if I recall correctly, they fed us doughnuts. We went to the town center’s main intersection, stood there, and were planning to watch the countdown, but then we changed our minds and left just before the stroke of midnight. We called my house to get a ride back. Maxine went back to California soon after that. "

    "body": "16 Not one person on my mother’s (large) side of the family had ever earned a college degree. Most of them, including my mother, had not finished high school. “Dropping out and just starting work was more common then,” the explanation had always been. My father’s father had been an accountant with a large home, a grandfather clock, and a hilly yard where a hammock hang between trees. When I was in grade school, my father had gone to college and majored in French after being laid off from a factory job. This had left my mother the only one in the household working for income. My mother’s relatives had strongly disagreed with this decision. My mother and father had grown up in two somewhat different worlds; my upbringing had prepared me for neither of them. 17 The first college class I sat through was English 101. A plain-looking woman stood at the blackboard, writing in white chalk the difference between subject and object pronouns. I thought it was ridiculous that this was being taught in a college class. There was a girl in the class I thought was cute, but she was too old for me, of course. All of my classmates were too old for me; I was only sixteen. The girl had dark hair and a silver labret piercing. On the second day of class she sat next to me. For fun I had brought my little blue teddy pear, Pancreas, with me to school. I had it on my desk. I was also wearing the long, black coat I always wore in winter. I was also probably wearing my black cowboy hat over my thick, long hair. She talked to me. She liked Pancreas, she said—he was cute. I let her play with him, and she let me read from her private journal. After class she held the door for me as I walked behind. I wasn’t walking conspicuously behind, just coincidentally behind. She smiled, too, when she held the door for me. She and I chatted next to the flagpole while she waited for her ride and I waited for the bus. The instructor had said that everyone should exchange numbers with someone else in the class, in case we were going to be sick or if we lost a homework sheet. It was the cute girl who brought up that we should exchange numbers. She said that I should call her, anyway, and that maybe we could hang out sometime. Maybe we could hang out sometime! It had been years since anyone I had not met on the Internet had suggested that we should hang out. That night, I locked my door and bounced up and down on my bed. I listened to rock music. I stared at the slip of paper with her number on it. I paced around my room. I put the paper down on the bed and bounced some more. I stared at it. Then… I dropped it into the crack between my bed and the wall! And this was a waterbed; it couldn’t be moved. So, I searched and searched the house until I found that thing, that long skinny thing where you push one end and it makes a little grabby claw extend from the other end. I tried and tried and tried until finally I retrieved the number.  Exhale. Crisis averted. Now I could call. Yes. I grabbed the cordless phone. I listened to the dial tone for awhile. I turned the phone off. Turned it back on. Dialed the first three digits of the number. Listened to the silence. Hung up. Paced some more. I lay down and thought about whether or not I should call. It would be embarrassing if she really hadn’t wanted me to call. But had she said that I should do it. Yes. So, I called. I trembled and shook. She was on her way out, but said that she would talk to me some other time. Okay. Okay. But then she wasn’t in the next class. Nor was she in the class after that. I tried calling again, still trembling. I asked for her. Another voice came on the phone. It didn’t sound like her. But I had asked for her! “Who is this?” the voice asked. “Levi,” I replied. “Who?” I fell silent. “Hello?” The voice sounded annoyed. I hung up. She didn’t show up for the next few classes, either. I too dropped the class not long after that. 18 I had butterflies in my stomach during acting class. But still, I smiled to myself when I thought about it. I didn’t know how to act around people, so I was taking Fundamentals of Acting. It was just like how I didn’t know how to communicate, so I was taking Introduction to Communication. Pat, the acting instructor, drilled it into our heads that we were all required to audition for the Spring production of Aphra Behn’s The Rover. We could turn down a role if we didn’t want it. I auditioned. I was cast in a very small part. I was in the band of revelers. I was a soldier, also. I had one line: “You’re coming with me. ” In rehearsal for The Rover, I remember practicing in the C building there, outside the entrance to the Forum Theater. I was to dance with the choreographer, Carla—but I had never danced. I didn’t know how to do it. She was like “Oh, just do it! Just move!” I was still learning how to move my body in the ways people wanted me to. I was still learning to smile, even. 19 I began in my free time to exercise, to count grams of fat and calories and even, before it was popular to do so, carbohydrates. My mom had an exercise bike and ski machine, which I would use while watching VHS tapes of music videos. Sometimes I would walk from Chicopee to the Hampshire Mall in Hadley—a trek that took hours. I was losing a good deal of weight. 20 “There are three kinds of people in this world: the kind of person who’s opposed to going to war with Iraq; the kind of person who goes home, eats beef, has a heart attack and dies at age thirty-five, leaving nothing to show for his existence but life-giving nutrients for the planet to feed off of; and the deaf, blind reporter friend who injured himself at age twelve so he could grow up to become somebody’s deaf, blind reporter friend. ” I had a dream that Dweezil Zappa, son of the musician Frank Zappa, said this to me over the Internet. 21 I think in sixth grade I was kind of sort of attracted to a boy but didn’t really want to admit it to myself… and I really don’t remember anything about him, but I think he was pretty. I kind of rationalized my way out of really considering myself attracted to him, which in fact has happened quite a bit within my life and I can type at 90 to 95 wpm but still it can’t nearly keep up with the speed of my mind so it’s like “jump ahead” “okay” “now wait” “okay” like when you’re riding a bicycle alongside somebody who’s walking and you have to pump at a certain speed so your bike doesn’t fall over but then you have to stop and kind of wait for them to catch up, and it’s really like that when I’m writing. It’s sad. 22 Back last September when I was at the Radio 104 “Big Day Off” concert, a big event at Riverside Park consisting of performances by mostly mediocre bands, I made sure to squeeze right up front for Blondie’s set, but then after the set ended I started getting, basically, dehydrated, and as the world kind of faded away and my vision just went more or less completely bye-bye, I stumbled backwards through the crowd to try and reach where I could actually get myself something to drink… and soon I was just, I didn’t even have the energy to really push through, I was just limping through. . some girl (I couldn’t see her but I think I could just tell she was a girl) helped me through some of it but then just vanished, leaving me to collapse in front of someone and say, “Please… I need a drink,” to which the other girl just said, “Does it look like I care?” So on the ground there I just kind of kneeled until my vision came back and I had the strength to stumble up the stairs to where I could get a drink of water. Anyway, after that I figured it’d be in my best interest to actually… hm… I should call and request the new Tori Amos song on the radio. I will after I finish this really long train of thought. I figured I’d best just relax… so I did for a bit in the seats, and then I wandered around the park a bit as the Mighty Mighty Bosstones came on, and I wandered around and suddenly I was depressed and I was just like, “How stupid is this entire rock n’ roll concept?” and then suddenly I felt totally disgusted by anything having to do with anything and then I just wandered around some more and was so sad and I looked it and I was tired and I sat down on a bench and just… wished I could cry but of course that’s something I just blocked myself off from back in middle school because I was just crying all the time and it was obviously helping nothing and it was obvious that no one cared. So I just sat there on the bench and was thinking of all those images I was bombarded with in entertainment and such as a small child of how when you’re in your darkest hour and things are looking gloomy and you’re sad and depressed someone will come to you, there’s going to be that wonderful, caring person who’s going to come to you and say, “What’s wrong?” So then I actually started playing over in my mind these kinds of scenarios where, “What would I do if someone came over here and started being really nice to me and actually caring about how miserable I am?” and as I’ve often done in the past I played over these great scenarios in my mind, which made me all the more depressed as people walked by without so much as a thought of “Hey, I’ve been there, I understand, no one wants to be alone when they’re sad” and that’s really just one example, I’ve felt that kind of thing quite a few times. So anyway, that’s something that’s always haunted me, so whenever I’ve thought of the wonderful life I could possibly lead if only things were going well or if only whatever or if I had friends and such, I would just think of those times, and I’d think of someone being there and understanding when I’m sad and listening and stuff. And then… suddenly now it seems like that’s happening. Not all the time, but it’s actually happening, whereas in the past I’d never had anyone care about what I might be feeling at any particular moment. And of course a lot of people are still in that mode, and it’s like they refuse to acknowledge the very existence of emotions and how everyone really could use a little help in times when they’re feeling down and that sort of thing, but… One day when I was just wandering around and really wondering why I was just always so not-at-ease around people and why I couldn’t win friends and that sort of thing, a girl from my acting class, Maureen, saw me there and asked that question: “What’s wrong? You look sad” or something along those lines… and things kind of went on from there and we wound up talking for about an hour afterwards, her advice and my whining. If nothing else, it was just really nice to have someone actually… in real life, that is… listening to me and just… at least doing their best to help me out, to try and understand, to acknowledge that stuff. And then another day I was just ready to catch my bus and another girl from my acting class, Linda, was walking around alone, which was kind of odd since it was rain/snow/sleeting out at the time and I thought I was the only one who really enjoyed being out in that kind of stuff, but she was there and she said “What are you doing?” and I said, “Killing time before the bus gets here. ” “You wanna go wait inside, then?” I just kind of shrugged and said sure. Even though I knew the bus really was probably going to arrive at any moment, I didn’t want to miss this opportunity for human interaction. So we walked inside and as soon as we were in she just suddenly broke down crying and it was such an odd experience to me, all I could relate it to was a movie or something because I wasn’t used to that kind of thing existing in reality, but she started talking about how she’d lost her home, her car, her job, and now she didn’t know what she was going to do and really all I could do was just stand there because… I didn’t know what to do… and in retrospect I should have given her a great big hug right there and then had her sit down, but in the moment I just didn’t know what my expected role really was, and I didn’t want it to be something where it becomes painfully obvious that someone didn’t appreciate what I was trying to do because it didn’t fit in to what I was expected to do or whatever, but I just stood there and she talked and then we did start walking over towards where there were seats, but halfway there she just suddenly said, “I’m going to faint… I’m going to faint,” and then she went all limp and I caught her and tried to get her over to the nearest chair, although I know I really should have just sat her down on the floor against the wall where we were and everything, but in any case she recovered then and she was pretty much okay as I helped her to the chair and sat down on the floor next to it. She continued on then with talking, and by now I knew I’d missed my bus, but I most definitely was not about to leave her there. Then she said she wanted to walk outside and I said I really didn’t think she was in the best of conditions to be doing that, especially when she tried getting up and went all dizzy again and sunk down to the floor, but she persisted and we wound up going outside, then talking a little bit outside of the door under the precipitation, and she said, “Y’know, I should just jump off here right now,” looking over the concrete wall to a lower level of the campus. I looked down, and I said, “No. No, you shouldn’t. It’s not nearly high enough for you to kill yourself jumping off of,” not knowing what else to say. Then we ran into another girl, whose name I still don’t know, who was like, “Where have you been?” and Linda told her the story and then took me to where some more of her friends were and said, “This is Levi. He’s my hero. I fainted and he caught me,” so I kind of waved weakly and slunk away. This wasn’t the same as the thing with Maureen, of course, but it was interesting and unusual. And then just other simple things, like with yet another girl from my acting class, whose name was Erika. One day there were auditions for The Rover and I was uncertain about auditioning and she helped me out with that. So, that was nice. 23 It’s 3:30 in the afternoon and I’m still waking up. I know I really should be getting back on schedule for the whole school thing, but, um… I dunno. I guess I’ll just have to when the time comes. I was going to go to HCC to study for the CLEP tests that I have on Saturday (which, if I pass them, can be used for college credit) but! I’m just a really bad slacker. I know I’ll at least get it done tomorrow, though. I also really have to send that letter to Jasmine. Jasmine is a friend of mine in New Mexico I met online, but then her parents got rid of AOL so I’ve just been communicating with her through the mail… and I’m really overdue in responding. So, I’m going to prepare her letter now, then I’m going to grab Cynthia and Carol’s number so I have it as a reference on job applications, then I’m going to shower, then I’m going to go out and go for a walk and see if I can’t find myself the opportunity to get some work!

Do you think it’s worth it and Do you think there’s anything better to do? Do you think it’s worthwhile to stand around in front of the TV and to bob? Or to talk? Pretend champerdee? (Nah tubee) Not (notnot).  Not (notnot). 25 I’m sitting within the driving class and it’s… odd to be around my peers (and average ones, at that), so I must (sick as it is, so used to high school you never truly understand how horribly these children are affected by the torture they are subjected to until you watch them within the context of a situation like this!) And the teacher when I entered said, “You’re supposed to come in here first. Can’t you read the sign?” or something along those lines in the kind of evil, condescending tone that one could only get away with while dealing with children. So when the other teenagers speak, they whisper. That’s hilarious. My hair smells of hairspray and gel. Fortunately no one is too closely seated in relation to me. This guy’s trying to be a disciplinarian. “Don’t play games. ” This is just great. “See those numbers there on your learner’s permit?” he says, “Write them here on the card I handed you. ” Assuming that we don’t know what our social security number is… yeeeesh. I’d forgotten what being treated like such garbage felt like. No wonder I was such a pissed off little boy. Heh. I’m in college. Once in awhile the significance of that just hits me. Looking at these people my own age and comparing to those at school… hilarious. “Look up here so you know what I mean by upper left hand corner. ” These chairs are hell, too. They must do that intentionally. I actually feel dumber within this place, dumber, treated dumber. Not only does he hand out sheets having to do with the course, fees and such, but he reads it aloud twice, the second time explaining it. It’s suddenly weird to have it assumed that we’re under our parents’ wings. At school it’s assumed we’re not. Hehe… yelling at some of the other kids: “If you keep this up during my class, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. ” Wow, so this is why I’d never stay awake in high school. Us and them! Aw, no films of people getting splattered against the pavement. 26 I didn’t cry on the first day of kindergarten. My mom was like “Are you sure you’re okay?” as all the other children didn’t want to be left behind without their parents, but I was content with the xeroxed Smurfs pictures I was coloring in as I sat there, and I was rather throughout my childhood in such an oblivious state to the others around me. Meaning, I didn’t think about the fact that they could see me, was rarely sociable…My kindergarten teacher was Mrs. Slattery. During and after the school year, I went over her house quite often, because she lived so close to me. She would usually favor me with some new books to read or something: James and the Giant Peach, that kind of thing. My first friend was Zachary. I got to know him in kindergarten, he and I already knew how to read so we would go to a first grade class when it came time to do reading work. My mind refuses to work Superkid baron to be sitting on Superswing and I “First to the swing gets the swing to the swing” and a swing was a coveted thing but I always had my Superswing and I joy for the playground and I’m waiting for the afterschool CCD (Catholic religious classes) and a kid tries to jump from the swing and then hit me so I kick him where it counts and the noonmother tells me that’s a nono, then I’m off to learn about God.  It’s really cold in the present. It’s really cold. It’s very warm in the past. It’s quite so warm. I need to the must fureechavawurd eechawado… shiver and shake. Shiver and shake. No. Warmth in each piece. Kids Incorporated. “Grownups are mean because they tell me what to do. ” As a child I had Daddy there giving me all I want and telling me that I was the most important person in the world to him. Development from that? Be a Superkid, natch. Each of the villains were each of the pests. 27 Today I walked to the mall and caught the bus as usual. As the bus pulled into the college I saw that everyone was standing outside and that a fire truck was parked where the bus would usually be pulling into. “A fire?” Turns out it was a fire drill, some of the staff had already been prepared for this and stuff, I saw the guy who sits next to me in my Psych class and he told me this, then a girl from my Communication class happened to be there and was like “You don’t have any stuffed animals today?” (Not the first time she’s mentioned this. Those kinds of things make me kind of happy that I have something to bring up in conversation, and kind of unhappy that it’s only, like, a novelty, like a trademark or something. I still get that sometimes about the cowboy hat I used to wear all the time, but since I’ve cut my once very long hair and ditched the hat I think I’m at least a little bit easier to take somewhat seriously…) We took a quiz in Psych, I hadn’t really studied except for this morning, but I did very well, except probably for the names of the researchers, which I always forget to study. 28 Elementary school overall wasn’t a particularly interesting time for me, yet somehow I managed to keep myself entertained. I was never involved in any sports (I tried joining a baseball team once but loathed the experience… I dropped out before we ever actually had a real game. The practices I went to just involved me sitting in the outfield saying “I really hope the ball doesn’t come near me. Is this over yet? I want to go home”)… I usually had several friends at a time I could do stuff with, though, so that was good for me. Overall, most of my time wound up being spent playing video games at home. Come sixth grade, people suddenly were beginning to start shoving me around for no reason in particular… I had a couple of big guys push me down to the ground, have one of them grab my arms and another my legs, lift me up and then drop me… I never saw this as behavior reflective of what was coming up for me so much as just isolated occurrences which had to happen once in awhile just because of course not everyone could be as nice as I was. But in middle school, everything suddenly went downhill. Seventh grade. Levi the fat kid with glasses. Each night I would cry myself to sleep just imagining having to spend another day navigating the hallways of Edward Bellamy Middle School… having people I didn’t know call me names and shove me into the walls… having my books knocked out of my hands and kicked down the hall as teachers looked on, by then desensitized, refusing to care. Not to mention the classes themselves, my classmates deciding to make a “look at Levi day”, one kid would clear his throat and everyone would turn to look at me and laugh at any reaction I might have. (Wonder why I’m so conscious of every movement I make? It doesn’t matter what you do, these children will find it funny. ) Levi getting blamed for doing something insignificant and getting yelled at, I tell the teacher who had really done it and I sound stupid when I say it and the entire class laughs at me. I’m walking around outside during lunch break where I’m minding my own business and suddenly a small group of children decide it’d be fun to begin pushing me and kicking me around, they continue to do this, I decide to try and retaliate for a second, not in that I attack them but in that I just show effect as opposed to having no reaction. “Stop it!” I yell and they laugh at how stupid I am and oh what a dork I am and they shove me some more and soon everyone’s joined in and as the bell finally rings and they finally allow us back into the building I try to get inside as quickly as possible and past the teachers come an ever-growing group of students hovering around me and kicking me and tripping me as I hurry down the hallway and I get to my locker and trying to ignore them as I (WHAM!) no time for combination as my face flies into the locker and it feels like my glasses are bent now and it feels like I have tears in my eyes but I’d better not show it for if it’s already just so bad as that now. Classes were circuses, classes were games for those simply tormenting me, teachers didn’t care about my situation. In fact, they hated me. “Levi! Stop talking to him!” as I finally say something to the child who’s been disturbing me for the entire class and then I say, “He’s bothering me!” and “Stop bothering him!” but no other action and repeat the process. The class went on a field trip, “All but those the teacher feels would cause a disciplinary problem”. I was not allowed to attend. Only me and those who were the worst at harassing me. I refused to attend class the day it would just be us. I was never capable of paying attention anymore. The times when I was being left alone, I was such a nervous wreck. I never studied at home, for each moment of home was a moment away from school and I couldn’t bear to think of school when I was instead actually non-miserable, so my grades simply fell fell fell. The straight A student getting Cs and Ds now. Teachers hate me for it, family hates me for it, students hate me already. Fat, ugly, nervous, awkward, friendless. At certain times during the year I had some people I would talk to, but at this time such things were very fragile and you could trust no one, for if they could win points with another friend of theirs by being cruel to you, they would do so. Sitting at home I would eat and eat and eat and watch MTV and play video games. That was all I needed, good enough. It reached the point where literally the only thing I ever looked forward to was Wednesdays, when new comic book shipments would come in. 29 I was starting summer classes—Sociology and something else—but then Jason was moving to California to be with Maxine, in the Bay Area, and he asked if I would like to head out there with him, join him on the cross-country bus ride and stay for a while. I said that yes, in fact, I would like to do that. 30 June 18, 1998. 2:33 PM. Batavia, NY. This seems like a pretty nice place. Jason, for some reason, just made a comment that it’s the “Chicopee of New York”, but it seems a lot calmer and a lot less dense and a lot less, um, cruel to me. Someone just hit me in the shoulder with a bag and didn’t apologize. Down south, if I shot him for that, it would be considered justifiable homicide. I really like this shirt I’m wearing. I haven’t washed my face in hours, and I can just feel the oily filth that’s all over me. How ew. And bus bathrooms don’t have sinks. They’re like port-a-potties. Actually, this here Batavia reminds me of the commercial districts down south… you know, those funny areas where there are lots of stores that don’t have bars on the windows. Jason has soda. I don’t drink as much soda these days. The guy in front of us has such a grotesque bald spot. I pity him. I am glad I do not have a grotesque bald spot… though if I keep wearing this silly cap, who knows?… I wonder how many funny looks I’ll get wearing a “Greenfield, Massachusetts” cap during this cross-country venture? I get enough funny looks for wearing it in Massachusetts… 5:17 PM. Just over the New York state line, according to Jason we’re now somewhere in Pennsylvania. How groovy—I managed to get myself about fifteen minutes of sleep, an accomplishment that I’m quite proud of. We have funky Amish-looking people in neat clothing sitting in front of us. When we were at the terminal in Buffalo, NY, Jason had wanted to take pictures of them. It’s really quite neat, the white beards and stuff… anyway. Haven’t gone insane yet. In fact, I feel quite fine. I wonder what that smell is. Hmm. This is my first time in Pennsylvania. It’s exactly… I use 5:17 Pacific Time to keep track of when I write in this, but really it’s 8:17 where we are right now. So, we’ve been at it for eleven hours so far. Not too bad. I think the long waits in the terminals are going to be quite nerve-wracking, especially in Chicago where we’ll have to hold onto Jason’s boxes and my suitcase as well as our backpacks. Jason’s had the window seat all this time… I’ve been far too kind, and he’s begun to take advantage of my giving nature. Oh, goodness. Bad thoughts are entering my mind again. Maybe that’s pepperoni I smell… only Jason hasn’t been eating. This bus is really quite packed, definitely moreso than our other buses (well, our other city-to-city trips… it’s all been in the same bus) have been. This is a really boring highway… at least from the aisle seat. Ahh! The guy next to me is eating… meaty substance, of some sort. June 19, 1998. 6:27 PM. Some of the exciting places we’ve stopped: Buffalo, NY, where we chilled with the Amish. Chicago, IL, home of Balki and cousin Larry Appleton. Iowa, home of corn. Omaha, NE, um. I dunno. It’s Omaha. Lincoln, too. Oh! And we stopped at a McDonald’s in Indiana, I think. They called soda “pop” and my heart stopped, because I’d only read about such perversions of culture. We’re pulling out of Lincoln, NE and heading west… Stay tuned for the next exciting installment. 31 I arrived in San Francisco on June 21, 1998. It was early in the morning—earlier than the scheduled arrival time had called for. Fortunately, I had an issue of Rolling Stone to keep me company, After a bit of a wait Maxine showed up, garbed in a spiffy-looking dress. I had been running back and forth between our sitting point and the restroom to readjust bits of hair protruding from under the front of my cap. 32 Maxine, Jason and I walked through neighborhoods where rose bushes peeked over fences to beautiful houses. Maxine picked roses like it was nothing at all; I was amazed at this. She, Jason and I, walking to the International House of Pancakes to eat in the morning. Talking about teleportation and being so clever it hurts. Laughing and smiling so much. But then little issues started to develop between Maxine and Jason. Maxine started saying to me, when we had moments alone, that Jason was getting jealous of me. Then it started to seem more reasonable that he should be jealous. Maxine and I would have staring contests with other on a regular basis. It was flirtatious. Walking by the pond for no particular reason, I would be wearing something outlandish. I would have spiked my recently-cut-short hair up so perfectly. With a half hour’s work it became a sort of crazy, sticky chaos I could wear in public without feeling ashamed to be seen. Then Maxine was dressed for bed one night, in a loose t-shirt and plaid boxers. Wrestling led to cuddling for maybe an hour led to rubbing noses. You’re touching each other, just trying trying to take it in as much as you can without getting caught you know that it’s good but you don’t know if it’s right and you don’t know if you deserve this or if you’ll ever find it again. She licked my lips, and I responded in kind. "

    "body": "33 Maxine being awoken by her mother with a list of chores, I refusing to budge and continuing to sleep: Jason, “It’s one in the afternoon now, you can feel free to get up at any time” and Maxine: “Fuck you”. 34 Writing in a little Hello Kitty notebook bought at a Sanrio store somewhere nearby. 35 Maxine’s 15 year old brother, Robert, liked to hang out with street punks in Berkeley. Maxine made fun of him for that. His thing was that he looked much older than his age, but he was naive. He spoke with enthusiasm about experiences at screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show—how the people there bit him and left marks. 36 And walking down the street, just Maxine and I, we would bite each other, too. These were long, but not harmful bites. 37 The people at Burger King and 7-11 have begun to recognize Maxine and me, greeting us when we enter. We fell in love with a guy who works at IHOP and were hoping to make tee shirts saluting his godliness… but alas, we did not and will not. 38 The weather here seems quite a bit colder than it was back in Massachusetts, much to my surprise. People jog and walk their dogs. Youngsters drive by screaming and “woo”ing at Maxine and me. 39 Levi closes his book for a moment as Maxine enters and gives him a hug. Jason lies motionlessly, blanket beside him on the floor, as he has been since my entrance a few minutes ago. I don’t know how to describe the frustration, the anger I feel towards her mother as she “sends me to bed”. 40 Maxine and I decide to take a bus to Massachusetts, where she’ll live with me at my mother and Bruce’s place. 41 “Don’t tell your mother about your plans until the day you’re going to leave,” her father said. So she didn’t. 42 Maxine had a hard time tolerating the three-day-long bus trip, but the hours passed until the days passed, and eventually we arrived in Chicopee at my mother’s house, which was tiny in comparison to Maxine’s parents’ house. Jason’s plan was to continue living with Maxine’s parents, oddly enough. He behaved himself and enrolled in courses at the local community college. 43 Maxine soon started saying that she missed her mother and that she wanted to be back home, and that she fucking hated me. As we walked the streets she would yell and cry but continue to keep pace with me. I learned to be patient, as these outbursts passed and we would eventually start being silly with each other again. I too was moody and awful. One day during this period, I typed the first chapter of my latest experimental-autobiographical work into my desktop computer: “I slept today—well, yesterday—until it was dark. I told Maxine to get out of my room and to stay out of my room for the rest of the night because I wanted to be able to write. She continued to pester me, so I locked us both out of the room and fell asleep on the couch for a few hours. Then I woke up. I’ve been alone in my room since, Maxine sleeping on the living room floor. ” Things were slightly more peaceful after she started working. She got a job in the footwear section of the Ames department store near my house. I was still without employment, but I found meaning in my days by writing and posting these writings to a personal web site. I even went so far as to begin recording my conversations with Maxine using a microcassette recorder my father had left in the house. I taught myself to encode these tapes into a new file format, RealAudio, which was the first to be designed for online streaming. 44 I started wearing Cover Girl liquid powder makeup to even out my complexion. I often wore too much, so it looked cakey. I spent long periods of time looking at myself in the mirror, seeing how my face looked when I made various expressions. I still had to perfect every last strand of my hair before I would be willing to leave the house. That hair became a tiger-like mix of brown and orange after Maxine bleached it for me. Although the plan had been to put blond color over it after it was bleached, I insisted that I did not want to even out the color. I preferred the unnatural, wild look. 45 The Fall 1998 semester was beginning, so Maxine and I signed up for courses at Holyoke Community College. I took a course called Basic Design, which was essentially an introduction to the making of visual art, but I didn’t much enjoy it. The instructor made fun of the fact that I was wearing suits and ties and cowboy hats to class. 46 I still didn’t have my license, but Maxine was allowed to drive Bruce’s car. On our way to Northampton one day, she saw a bird in the road and quickly slammed on the brakes. We were then hit by the car behind us. “What the fuck was that!” the other driver yelled, holding his hand up to a bleeding nose. “There was, like, a pheasant or something in the road!” Maxine exclaimed, crying. “A pheasant?” “Or something! It was a giant bird and I tried to slow down, but then I hit it!” “For a fucking bird?!” I walked to the marina across the road and dialed 911, then my mother. After the accident, Bruce’s car was scrapped. “I’m just glad you both are okay. That’s the important part,” he said. 47 Maxine and I rode several hours on buses to the town of Durham, New Hampshire so that we could see Tori Amos in concert. Our plan was to walk around and waste time until we could catch a bus back in the morning. However, the night turned out to be cold and rainy, so we charged a hotel room. It was a suite—the largest and nicest I had yet seen—because none of the standard rooms were vacant. 48 I was still seventeen, but while Maxine was living with me in Chicopee she turned eighteen. Just after midnight, to celebrate, we walked to a 7-11 so that she could buy a pack of cigarettes. Neither of us had ever smoked a cigarette before. We sat down across the street, on a curb outside of a closed shopping plaza, and we struck the first match. The sky lit up from heat lightning. We joked about it. On the way home I asked for another cigarette. Over the course of the week I smoked the rest of the pack. 49 Maxine subscribed to PVGoth, the mailing list for locals in the gothic subculture. Through this she learned about Haven, the goth dance night at a place called Club Metro in the town of Northampton. We tried to drive there one night, but we were never able to find the club. However, we did meet some people through the mailing list. There was one rather odd person we met up with only once, a guy who ranted to us about how angry he was at the world and how much he hated what he called the “norms”—people afraid to live life creatively or in an unorthodox way. Maxine and I got along much better with Dennis and Marta. These two were a reclusive twenty-something couple living in Marta’s mother’s basement. They told us that they had not been to Haven for some time because it wasn’t fun—the music was not great and they usually just sat around, drank some screwdrivers, then went home—but Maxine’s introduction to the list had made us sound interesting. We liked David Bowie, and that excited them. They had even seen us walking down Memorial Drive previously and had remarked to each other that it was unusual to see gothy types in Chicopee. (I was goth? I hadn’t realized. ) The two of them recorded noise using a four-track recorder. Mostly, on our visits, Marta remained silent while Dennis educated us about recording acts such as Legendary Pink Dots, Non, Swans, Merzbow, and Einsturzende Neubaten. The basement inevitably filled with smoke from all of our cigarettes. It was the stench from one of these late nights that eventually prompted my mother to ask: “You aren’t smoking cigarettes, are you?” “Yes,” I admitted to her. As always, I preferred to be honest. 50 Maxine and I decided to go back to California. I said that I would join her briefly at her parents’ home, then move on to Bakersfield to visit other online friends. Getting back to the west coast involved another grueling bus ride—airline tickets would have been more expensive—but this was my third such journey in the span of six months, and I was getting used to what long-distance travel by land entailed. 51 Her mother was particularly grumpy on the day we arrived. Simply stopping for fast food on the ride from the BART station to the house led to vicious debates between her and Maxine. Annoyed, I told Maxine that I wanted to leave later that day for Bakersfield. 52 I walked along the row of payphones (perhaps a dozen or so) until I found one unoccupied. I took the calling card from my wallet and dialed the toll-free telephone number on its reverse side. When prompted, I entered the card number using the touch-tone buttons. Then I entered the number I wished to call—V. ’s number. A young male voice answered the phone. He said that V. had left with Mischa (a close friend of hers, with whom I was also acquainted through the Internet) to rent a movie, but that they should be back before long. I walked into the Burger King connected to the Greyhound station, ate some french fries as slowly as possible, and wrote in my notebook. I applied makeup to my face in the men’s room mirror. I tried to purchase candy but lost money in the vending machine. When I called again, V. answered the phone. She was surprised, of course—we had not planned for me to be arriving yet—but eventually her father agreed to drive to pick me up. V. and Mischa sat on either side of me in the back seat of the vehicle. The face of V. ’s father showed itself occasionally in the rear view mirror. The two girls were loud and excited. They kept pointing out landmarks, both pleasant ones and disgusting ones, as we drove through the city. 53 I waved to V. ’s mother from across the house, then followed her and Mischa upstairs. V. ’s bedroom was tiny, but it also looked like the perfect teenage girl’s bedroom to me, with pictures of Smashing Pumpkins and Tori Amos cut out from magazines and stuck to the walls and various artifacts with great personal meaning lining every horizontal surface. There was also a spare room up there, and the laundry room, and the parents’ bedroom. V. ’s boyfriend Joe and her ex-boyfriend Caleb were there. I had not slept in forever, so I could barely process everything that was going on. I was shown a bunch of photo albums, but then before long V. had grown sad, for reasons mysterious to me, and she was curled up on the couch in a ball. Mischa, Caleb, and Joe talked amongst themselves, then, while I drifted off to sleep on the floor. 54 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas erupts from the television set. I, on the floor, waking, looking as pathetic as I can possibly amount to, hoping. That there will be a salvation; Mischa, Caleb, curled upon the couch in a lover’s embrace just as Joe sits beside in the knowledge that: if. He were to give up the couch he’d be like another Levi upon the floor, and. That. Is not a pleasant idea; V. , continuing her stay among the comfy furniturechair as she takes all of the liberty of position for which the crevices would give way… her mood improved to the point where it didn’t seem obtrusive for an obnoxiously loud television to be dishing out persuasive vulgarities, I didn’t consider (within my sorrowful, rejected stasis) that Joe was. Far. From where her affections might be lying. V. and I met one night in a Tori Amos chat room and kept chatting after that. V. for a while was also online friends with Ryan. Tara came soon after, emailing me at one point (coming to know of me through V. and also through my submissions to V. ’s poetry zine). It was a saddened email to which I responded accordingly, but. After that she never answered, and it wasn’t until awhile later that she actually began speaking to me. When I’d known her for awhile I posed the question “What was your initial reaction to me? What was your first impression?” to which she responded: “What? Don’t you remember my lusting after you?” The first chat sessions of ours were comprised mostly of her digging for details regarding my life, proclaiming that “I need to figure you out, boy”. And afterwards, Mischa. The first time I spoke with her I was also chatting with another person with whom I would later begin to speak on a regular basis (Courtnay, though she later stopped communicating with a declaration that “getting close to people only hurts me anyway, so why bother?”). I wasn’t able to fully and expediently offer that many contributions to the things Mischa was saying that night (pouring out tales of woe, in fact, so much in fact that I felt incredibly awkward in my inability to fully concentrate on the conversation. She surprised me with outbursts like “You’re so nice, you’re so helpful,” though, which at least made me feel a little better about the situation) and it was only later that we would begin to know anything about each other. So, yes, I awoke also, on my first night in Bakersfield, to the sound of the others as they entered the kitchen and began to cook themselves some late-night snack-foods. I asked, “Could anyone tell me where the bathroom is?” “We don’t have…” “You have to use the…” “Sorry, but…” Until eventually, “Here you go,” says Mischa, leading me to a room mere feet from where I’d been lying some moments prior. “You look so cute when you first wake up!” I had no plans, no idea how long I would remain in this part of California. 55 I moved to the couch in the dining/piano room, set apart where the other kids were hanging out. V. ’s mother and father had retired to the upstairs for the night. Again I slept. I awoke into a dimension without time, perplexed by crepuscular indoor lighting. I heard nothing but Counting Crows’ August and Everything After, which was playing through computer speakers in the next room. Caleb and Mischa turned out to be upstairs and awake, so we all walked down the street to the 24-hour Super K-Mart and browsed the merchandise. It was the middle of the night. "

    "body": "56 I met Justine and Paige on my second day in Bakersfield. The two were sisters, with Paige being the slightly older and much more talkative one. The two of them were for the time being living together, with Justine having just moved out of their parents’ house to stay with Paige. While Paige left to run some sort of errand, Justine let me stay in the back seat while she picked up friends from school. I had been told that the idea was for us all to go to the movies, but instead I was a reluctant tagalong for repeated cruisings up and down the same drag, often at unsafe speeds. Justine and her friends hollered out the windows at any cars on the road that happened to have teenage boys in them. They got one carful of boys to pull off into a parking lot; I sat in the back seat while everyone else stepped out of the car and went through their baffling-to-me flirtatious-yet-adversarial interactions, which, just as bafflingly to me, led to threats being hurled in our direction and our vehicle peeling out from the parking lot. Justine dropped me off for a few hours at V. ’s house, then. V. and I talked about emotional pain, pornography, and the band Nine Inch Nails. Then it was Paige who came back and picked me up. 57 I went to a record store with Paige, plus a guy who looked like a Backstreet Boy, plus one other guy. I picked up a biography of David Bowie (Loving the Alien). Then it was just Paige and I, back at the condo her and Justine’s father was renting contingent on Paige’s enrollment and participation in college classes. Paige was telling me about Justine’s history of drug use, psychotic breaks, and hospitalizations. “She lies,” she said. “Wherever she can. That’s just what she does. ” 58 Justine was missing in action and Paige was on her way to class when V. and her friend Kelly arrived, looking for something to do. We decided to head to the fitness center of this apartment complex while Paige was out. V. and Kelly stood in front of the mirrors and tried to remember dance moves. I pedaled on an exercise bike. “Believe it or not,” I said to Kelly, “I used to use exercise bikes all the time. My mom had an old one that had been sitting in the shed for as long as I could remember, so I would use it all the time while watching TV. I used it until the seat broke off. ” I hadn’t swum in any sort of water for many years, but I felt okay with getting into the pool since we all were in the same position of getting into it while wearing our street clothes. After swimming for a bit, we left our shoes and other possessions by the pool and went to spend time in the sauna. When we returned to the pool area to get our stuff, there were residents of the apartment complex ready to scold us for using the pool without proper swimwear. (It was “unhygienic”, we were told. ) 59 The next morning, after another night spent in Justine and Paige’s living room, I was very much due for some food. (I had been in the habit of hardly eating at all due to concerns about my weight, and this morning I was finding myself almost ready to faint as a result. ) Justine showed me the way to the building housing the laundry room, but once I was there I realized that I did not have any laundry detergent. I walked around, then, hoping to find my way back to the unit… but I couldn’t remember which number I was looking for, and nothing was familiar. So I walked to the nearby bookstore, paid for a notebook and pen, and sat outside writing until I knew that V. would be back home from school. Once I was able to reach her she gave a call, and Paige in turn met with me and took me back to her place. 60 At V. ’s house that night, Kelly and Caleb disappeared into the shower. V. , who had previously dated Caleb, was offended. She vented to me about the subject while I cuddled with her. Then we parted ways, with her going upstairs to her bed and me going downstairs to the couch. 61 “Follow us to school tomorrow!” said V. and Kelly. “I don’t know,” I said. “I’d get beaten. ” “Nooo! Come on. You’ll enjoy it. ” 62 In the morning, only about three or four hours after V. and I finally got to bed, I woke up to the sounds of the household in a rush. I wasn’t even sure that I was going with them to school until V. , her father, Kelly, and Caleb were all at the door, ready to leave, and they were asking me, “Um, are you coming?” and about to be driven by V. ’s father to the school bus stop. With my shoes still untied, then, I moved with everyone out the door. The car reached the bus stop with hardly a second to spare. Sitting next to V. , then, my mind was flashing back to how kids on the bus always used to pester and harass Jason and me. (“She likes you! Hey! Kid! You! Don’t you think this girl is cute? Huh? Isn’t she cute? You know you think she’s cute. She thinks you’re cute. Are you just going to disappoint her? She’s gorgeous! Hey!”) But this ride was calm, and I could see no evidence of the sort of antics I endured throughout my own middle and high school years. Tara had not been hanging out with V. or Mischa as often as usual in recent times; this was why I had not met her yet, even though we had had many long chats online. But I met her as the school day was starting. “Wow!” she said, speaking in reference to me but not directly to me, “He’s an actual person!” We didn’t try to go through any formal procedures to sign me in as a guest. V. just told her teachers that I was checking out the school as a possible transfer. First period was a psychology class; we worked on dream interpretation. Second period was James’s class. James was kind of a mentor figure to V. ’s friend circle. V. took a nap while I talked to Michael, who played in a local ska band. Then for a while I used the classroom computer to log to chat as joe@aol. com, which never served as my primary email account but which I would use on occasion to converse with the many strangers who, not understanding how America Online’s chat feature worked, would simply type the name “Joe” into their buddy list in the hope that this would enable them to speak to their uncle or brother or friend named Joe. The next group of students made its way into James’s classroom. Tara and Kelly were among the students. I sat myself in the aisle between the two of them. “You’re going to get shot, wearing that hat,” Tara said in reference to the big, black cowboy hat I was wearing. When V. and Mischa came back, they beckoned me toward the storage closet. “No,” said Tara to me, “Stay here. ” I told her that I would be diplomatic about it by staying next to her for a little bit and then joining the others in the closet… but as James began repeating the same lecture I had heard him give to the last class section, with Tara listening quietly, I gave her knee a quick hug, put my cowboy hat on her head, and walked away into the closet. 63 V. and Mischa, reading books. Mischa needed to finish something for academic decathalon, and V. with her volume on zen buddhism sitting and. Picking through the random stuff I grabbed The Odyssey. Their friend Alex entered. Eventually a girl named Violet joined as well, and she began asking everyone to get naked for pictures, lifting her own bra in an attempt to inspire us. Alex: “There’s no film! What about your camera, Mischa? Is there film in there?” and she went to get her camera and through it all, Levi. Sittingthere was something very strange about the circumstance, and in the room was a giant window leading to the outside and after all was said and done it was “Oops!” said Violet “I didn’t realize anyone could’ve been looking in” and I raised my eyebrow but. The room, it seemed, a traditional storage place filled with the surplus books and past yearbooks and the little cards they used when it came to teaching foreign students the basic words of English; the second story of the building, overlooking the street from the window: barely enough room for us to be seated comfortably in the circumstance, still a couple of chairs and I was sitting by V. and by Mischa and “I like it when you scratch my head!” because I’m a little doggieboy. After this, Mischa was like “Somebody come with me to the bathroom. I have to use the bathroom”, and just as I’d done a little earlier in the day I accompanied her and waited outside… the first time her saying, “Uh, no, Levi, you can’t come in with me. This is the girls’ room” and my “I’m not attempting to!” and some passersby giving me odd looks… When we returned, Violet was still pushing the idea of nudity, and she was begging everyone in her company to take off their clothes, but. I, for my part, didn’t really like the idea of having a teacher open the door to a storage closet and exposing to the class my genitals, which would have been a possibility. 64 After that class period ended, Violet and V. wanted another cigarette. We lucked out and saw that the front gate was open and unguarded, which meant that I was able to walk with them to their usual smoking spot. I surprised them by asking for one of their cigarettes. Violet left after smoking her cigarette, leaving V. and me to wait for Mischa. “I just don’t understand,” said V. , “Why Mischa wouldn’t just hurry up and come outside. I mean, we were supposed to come out for a smoke before the mock trial meeting, and for her to pass that by for Tara…” “That was kind of surprising,” I affirmed, “With them hugging and all. ” “Yes. That was scary. ” V. started talking about the history of her friendship with Mischa, then: “We’ve been friends for so long, and it’s amazing that we’ve been able to put up with each other for so long, but… we understand each other, and I can be really sensitive to things but she’ll still say things outright. Mischa’s not one to say one thing and mean another. Mischa will tell it to your face if she has a problem with you. ” We ended up going inside for the mock trial meeting without Mischa, even though Mischa was the only one involved in that extracurricular. She arrived eventually, as V. and I were dozing off… 65 “Wake up, you two!” It was Mischa, alerting us to the fact that it was time for us to catch the bus. V. falls back to sleep on the bus. I lean my head against her. The bus rolls through the city. No one taunts me. No one throws anything at me. 66 V. and I walked to Paige and Justine’s place, where the three of us went swimming again. This time we did it at night, when the sun would not beat down on us and the neighbors would not scold us. Paige asked me what I was doing with my life. I said the sorts of things I was learning to say when I was asked that question: I said that I was taking a break from college, that I wanted to “find myself” first, and that I would most likely end up going into computer programming. 67 That night I ended up staying in V. ’s spare room, on the second floor, right next to her own bedroom. In the morning, hearing the unmistakable voice of V. ’s mother as she opened the door to her daughter’s room and told her the time, I pulled myself up into a sitting position and stepped into my black boots. I paced for a minute, shivering, then threw on my long, black coat and stepped out the guest room door. “What are you doing?” V. asked. “I’m getting ready to leave. I have to take off when you go to school, right?” “No, I’m not going to school today. I’m feeling sick. And tired. I’m taking the day off. ” So we each had the blessing, then, of some more time to sleep. 68 Lying on the bed next to V. , hugging her, I remembered how many times in previous years I had sat on campus, or at home, or on the bus, or in my old high school classroom, wishing that I had someone to hug casually like this. 69 When I checked my email I found that Maxine had sent me about seven different emails saying that Patty (one of the two dwarf hamsters she had purchased from the pet store down the street while living with me in Massachusetts) was sick. I gave her a call, then, which went something like: “Hello?” “Maxine?” “Hi. ” “What’s wrong with Patty?” “Is that the only reason you call?” “I haven’t had a lot of time when I’m free to call. ” “Well, Patty’s dead. ” “What! How?” “I was letting them run around and then I didn’t know but my dad let Jimmy the rat out and he bit Patty and we took her to the vet and the vet said she would be okay but we took her home and then a few hours later my mom found her and she was dead!” “Oh, jeez. ” “And she tried everything and she even tried, like, giving her little hamster CPR, but she couldn’t do anything, and it’s not my fault! I didn’t want her to die! It’s just that my father let the stupid rat out!” She cried for the rest of the call. While I was making phone calls, I also spoke to Justine. “My dad is going to be staying here for the next several days,” she said. And with that, I had nowhere to stay. 70 Initially, V. ’s parents had not granted permission for me to stay in their house at all. It had become more and more difficult with each passing night for V. to secure permission for me to stay in their house. My welcome had been overstayed, now, and I had nowhere to be. “I know a lot of people,” V. said. “It’s fine. Things will work out. We’ll make them work out. ” Sitting on the edge of her bed, then, she made phone calls while I sat and bit my nails. I reflected on how I had come to be here, so far from where I was raised, where I only knew anyone because of this new thing called the Internet, this new technology, which we kids were generally taking to much more quickly than the adults, because that’s how kids are when it comes to new technology—they’re the early adopters. And I remembered the email she had sent me: “You’ll stay here for Thanksgiving and we’ll dine on grilled cheese sandwiches and whatever else I can find with five dollars at the Super K. ” Somehow, things changed, and it was once again okay for me to stay at Justine’s place.

    "body": "71 Watching The Simpsons with V. in the early evenings was becoming a bit of a tradition. Which was fine with me, because my only prior associations with the watching of that television show related to my father, who when the series first premiered had been as much into it as I. (When the show premiered, I was Bart Simpson’s age. ) Now, when I thought of this animated show, I was going to think not about my father lying on the living room floor shirtless and with his gut hanging out, but instead about lying next to V. there on her bed and having her say, “Mmm, we need some Honey Nut Cheerios” when a commercial for that particular cereal came on, and us then walking to the Super K specifically to buy a box of it. 72 There we were again, inside the clubhouse gym. The radio blasted some god-awful pop station and the machines were in use by the other (glaring) people who were actually taking their use seriously. I was tormented by boredom and had stepped on the scale out of a curiosity about where my weight was at. “One hundred thirty-two and one half pounds,” I said to Justine and Damien as they paid no attention to me. “With heavy boots and clothes on. ” This was the lightest I could recall having ever been. I was not in the mood for exertion, but still I plopped myself on one of the gym’s exercise bikes. Beneath me I felt the discomfort of a bony ass on a poorly-designed seat, and after about two or three petals I hopped off. “I’m gonna go and walk some,” I said. “Oh! Where are you gonna go?” “Probably just kill some time walking in various places… wait until V. gets out and go over to her house. ” “Well, all right. If you change your mind, we’ll be here for awhile. ” Outward, squeezing through the gates of the complex, across the street and through the Vons parking lot. Nothing to do here, nothing to do, and it’s just the emptiness that comes with visiting in a place where I don’t have any routines established… waiting for the people I’m dealing with to have a space in their schedule. Oh, look. It’s a mother with her young daughter. She’s yelling at her for coming too close to me… 73 After spending the afternoon getting looks from the employees of the Super K and the Wal-Mart (because in each case I had been walking around in their store for a couple of hours) I stood outside of the elementary school just down the street from V. ’s house. I watched students get off the bus, and I thought I saw her, but I couldn’t be certain. At a distance I followed behind. I didn’t manage to catch her before she disappeared into her house. So I knocked on the door. V. ’s father answered. “V. !” he called. Then she and I galloped up the stairs, as usual, and hid in her bedroom—where, as usual, we watched The Simpsons. Mischa came over with an ex-boyfriend of hers. After a bit of deliberation we decided to go to Justine’s condos and play some billiards. Mischa and her ex played a game, but then they had to leave sooner than expected. V. and I played a game ourselves. V. won easily. 74 “Spare some change?” Alex asked the other students as they passed by. He jiggled the Diet Coke can so that you heard the coins inside. “I’m trying to save up enough money to go to the dance tonight. ” “Sorry. ” “Nope. ” “I’m all out. ” “Oh. ” Shaking the can a little more, “Well. All right, then. ” So far all the open gates had been guarded, keeping us from leaving the high school campus to meet with V. and Mischa. Alex, with his attempts to save up money, had been holding us up.  As we walked along the perimeter, he suddenly said to me, “We’regonnajumpthefenceGO!” In my long black coat and cowboy hat I was just about as conspicuous as I could possibly be. One leg over, one leg over, coat stuck… shit! I scraped my hand getting over. I walked quickly, then, but as if nothing was odd. Alex tossed my bag over and followed. “They saw us,” he said. “What?!” “They saw us. Hurry up. ” We crossed the street. “They were on a walkie-talkie,” he said, “And I heard them say, ‘We got a jumper!’ so… I think I’d better stash the stuff, just in case. ” He ran behind the building, found a fast food box, stashed the cannabis inside it, and left the box in a space in the dumpster. Then we walked away. “There you are!” said V. and Mischa, grinning, when we found them. “They saw us hop the fence,” said Alex, putting a slight damper on the mood. “Really?” “Yeah. So I had to hide my stuff just in case. ” “Where?” “Right back there. ” We walked over, and he showed them. “Oh!” Mischa enthused. “You’re so clever!” I was still bleeding from where the fence had penetrated my hands when, in order to get back on campus an hour later, I hopped the fence again and gave myself an even larger gash. 75 I then stopped keeping consistent journals of my time in Bakersfield. As a result, many events from the following year would store themselves inside my brain in awkward ways, complicating my future attempts at making a narrative out of them. 76 While I walked casually across the school campus with V. one day, a school security guard stopped me. She said that hey, she recognized me. She knew all the students who went there, and I wasn’t one of them. She had seen me hopping the fence the other day. I had better come with her. Arms behind your back, please. We have to handcuff you, and frisk you, ask you questions, photograph you, and say, “We’re sending these pictures to every school in the district. If you are caught in the vicinity of any school in the district, you will be arrested. ” That was the last time I tagged along to go to V. ’s school. 77 I received numerous emails from my mother and father asking where their seventeen year old son was. I was not calling them very often. 78 V. ’s bedroom was small. An old Apple Macintosh was by her bed. It still worked, although it wasn’t Internet-ready. Her old files were on it. It had sentimental value to her. She liked to take bits of old candle wax and a wick and, in a tiresome but presumably meditative process, use a lighter to melt the old wax into a new candle. She would then give the new candle to someone as a gift, or else use it for herself. I listened to V. talk when she broke up with Joe. It didn’t seem especially surprising, I had to admit. They hadn’t been spending much time together. More often, it had been she and I who had been in each other’s company. My arm supported my head while I listened to her reflect on the now-finished relationship. I hugged her. She kissed me. 79 The way it went was that V. would be at the computer. I would be sitting on the couch watching television and talking to her occasionally, but failing to get her attention. I would get really into re-reading my copy of Naked Lunch or somesuch. I would think to myself, “That’s how I’ll get her attention: I’ll make myself feel completely satisfied on my own. Then my contentment will attract her. ” And my trick worked! Soon, we’d be cuddling, and that would last awhile, and we would be kissing softly, and that would last forever forever forever. Reverently touching. Softly. Softly. 80 We downloaded MP3 files of songs. These were the early days of digital music. Hotline was the program that we used. There were different channels, which anyone could start. How it worked was, you connected to someone’s channel and you downloaded whichever of that person’s available files you wanted. 81 At school, James taught the class using a poem that V. had written about her and me. He handed a xerox of it to everyone, then picked apart its meaning. V. recorded the lecture and conversation onto micro-cassette so that I could listen after she got home. 82 V. and I ended up in a hotel room for New Year’s Eve. We were there with Alex and his older brother and some other people. The little television screen played Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve. This was my first time drinking alcohol. I had Bacardi 151 rum. The taste was bitter, but I couldn’t compare it to anything else and it was New Year’s Eve and it was time to drink, so I was downing the liquor, straight, as if it were orange juice. V. and I kissed ferociously as the year turned into 1999. 1999! This was the final year that we would have, that anyone would have, beginning with a “1”! It was one year before the future! Soon, the excess of alcohol began to kick in. I stumbled to the bathroom and threw up in the toilet. V. stayed by my side. She helped me to crawl on all fours when I wanted to lend the room out for someone who needed to pee. When I had vomited everything I was going to vomit, she was still holding me in her arms, on the floor. The other folks were falling asleep. We lay silently, for part of the time, then started to talk about things. What did we talk about? It was all very beautiful, I know. V. never stopped saying beautiful things. Unlike me: I said beautiful things sometimes, but at other times, well, I was just vomiting crudely in a hotel room, struggling to say anything but thank you I love you you… You didn’t need to do this… I want to… say I appreciate… and so forth. It seemed to me that, even when she was down, the romance was strong. 83 Not long after that, I made plans to leave for the Bay Area to stay with Maxine’s family again. Who knew for how long. It just had become impractical for me to be in Bakersfield any longer. The night before my bus left, V. and I took a walk down the street to the elementary school. In the center of the field there, I asked her, “What do you think about my leaving?” She said, “I think… I’m going to miss you. ” 84 How did it go, then? I went back and forth so many times between Massachusetts and California, between the Bay Area and Bakersfield, it’s difficult, actually, to remember now. "

    "body": "85 I take my position against the wall outside the C building at Holyoke Community College. “What are you up to?” asks a guy who is one of my classes. I answer him honestly: “I’m actually trying to figure out whether or not to stay here and keep going to classes. ” “Dude,” he responds, “Don’t give up. ” He talks about how his own life has bounced him from place to place. He admits that HCC is not the most appropriate place for those looking to meet friends: “The people who are here are really cliquey. But mostly, too, I think it’s that a lot of them are working full-time, or they have children. A lot of people who are coming here are just doing it because they’ve already established something in their lives and now they want to move on. ” 86 It’s the first time I have ever felt bold enough to sit down in the Drama Club green room outside of a rehearsal. I find myself flipping through a script that has been left on the table when the play’s author, Tingley, walks in. He is wearing a bowler hat, a tie, and a black suit jacket. His long, dark hair has been pulled into a ponytail beneath the hat. I’m not accustomed to being the most normally-dressed person in the room, so of course I have to ask him about this: “Are you dressed up for something in particular, or just for kicks?” He thinks about the question for a moment, then answers it in verse: “There comes a time ‘tween life and death when all men stop to catch their breath. We ask the stars ‘Why?’, we question our lot, the heavens open wide and reply, ‘Why not?’” 87 College seemed to be going well for me that semester—surprisingly well. Unfortunately, whenever I was back home in my room I would return to feeling sad, lonely, and worried that by returning to Massachusetts I had spoiled opportunities for happiness I might never get back. I went to school with the intention of withdrawing, but before I could do that I ran into Tingley again. I mentioned to him that I was considering whether or not to leave and he advised me to stay. I went to my Acting classes that day, all of which were enjoyable and filled with pleasant socializing. I returned home invigorated. But the next day was the rehearsals for one-acts. I auditioned, felt unsatisfied with my audition, then stayed awake all that night, having a frantic chat with V. In the morning, still sleep-deprived, I decided that I would go back to California again. 88 Day 1. Dropped off at the Fairfield Mall with my stuffed friend Mr. Tree, a hat, and two bags. I had called in the morning “I’m not sure if I can last the whole time, but I’d like to try. ” “If you’re not sure, then drop out. ” “Okay. ” “What are you going to do with your time, then?” “Go to California. Today. ” “You can’t, blah. ” I say I can, pack my bags, not an easy task when she leaves work to bother me. We go to get identification at Mailboxes, Etc. , then to mall. At mall I smoke my last cigarette and take PVTA to Springfield Greyhound bus terminal. There, get tickets, “You can leave on 12:15 to N. Y. but the transfer to the L. A. bus isn’t until 7. ” I take it anyway. New York, call Mom: “I still wish you wouldn’t do this” making me feel guilty. “Mom, it was college or this” “I love you” “I love you, bye” (uncharacteristic “I love you”s. ) First thing in N. Y. C. info booth, scary old guy: “Where you headed?” “Bakersfield, California. ” “Okay, let’s go. That’s what I do for a living. I’ll drive you there. ” “I already have my ticket, sorry. ” “Yeah. (mean) Thanks to you too. (To next) Hey, where you going?” Outside, wishing I hadn’t my bags so I could wander. Bum smoke off young girl, maybe twenty. Blond, looks interesting. She hands me a light. Scary (another) homeless guy asks her for one, she says she hasn’t any. He doesn’t believe me when I say I haven’t any. “I bummed this one, honestly. ” “Okay (reluctantly)” Buy pack of GPC’s—they don’t card me. She forgets to hand the pack over. “Um, the GPCs?” shaking. Scary old lady—”Buy me a hot dog?” “Trying to conserve my cash” Gave her change anyway. Walk five miles to get to Gate 70. Wait, wrote, read Discovery magazine. On bus, ride in Pennsylvania. Call V. “Where are you?” “Pennsylvania” “How’s the weather?” “Average. Kind of windy. What are we doing once I’m there?” “Living in the streets together, I suppose. ” “I can’t stay at your house at all?” “No, I just don’t have everything mapped out. ” (In N. Y. I’d tried calling Maxine collect. The call was refused. ) Sleep on bus. Day 2. Cleveland—guy telling tale of old man beaten there—the terminal was too busy for anyone to call an ambulance. Old homeless guy bums smoke. “I dropped out of college too. Got me where I am today. ” Chicago. Scary guy tries to sell me acid. After—”Cigarette?” “Sure. ” “Walk over here. ” “Uh. ” Hesitantly, staying within sight of others. “What kind of stuff you got back in Massachusetts?” “Not much of anything, actually. ” “C’mon, man, be straight with me. Pot?” “No. ” “Acid? You do acid? ‘Cause I’m the source around these parts. Sell ya 7 hits for $20. ” “Sorry. Trying to conserve money. ” “Spare 75 cents?” Gave him what change I had. “C’mon, that’s it?” “That’s all I have. ” In terminal, white guy asks me to watch his bags. On bus, annoying teens in front of me talking the whole way. Iowa 80 truck stop. No cold water. I decide not to buy anything. Iowa City, guy, 22, to me: “Hey, sup?” “Hello. ” He’s there. “Yeah, I have a goth friend…” somewhere. He’s talking quickly. “Oh? Is that where you’re going?” “No. I have a Pagan girlfriend I’m going to see. Getting away from where I was. Bad things were going on there. ” “Yeah?” “Got the shit beat out of me. I have newspaper clippings (regarding kids beating 22-year-old) I’m the 22-year-old. ” “Jeez. ” “I met my girlfriend online. ” “Really? All my friends I met online. Including the ones I’m visiting in Bakersfield. ” “Yeah, I met her at Firefly. ” “Oh, I know of Firefly. I was there very briefly a long time ago. ” “Well, do you know her? She’s __. ” “Uh. . no. I didn’t get to know anyone on there. ” “Did you know ____?” “No…” “She wrote ____. It was controversial. ” “Why?” “(Something unintelligible)” I get in line to get a beverage, as the soda machine is broken. He follows. “Do you know __ room on Firefly?” “No, I wasn’t on for long. ” “? __ created that. ” “Oh… no. ” “I’m surprised you haven’t. It’s a gothic room. Pretty well-known. ” “Oh. ” Eventually he leaves. On bus, woman, thirty, with Hot Topic bag and whiteout messages on her backpack, loads of stuff. “Is anyone sitting here?” “No. ” “This is the northbound to Frisco. ” “No it isn’t. ” It works out. She had warrant for her arrest and had to go back home—all her friends at the clubs in San Jose will freak out when they see her, she says. I get out CDs. she pulls out Rammstein. “You know them?” “Yeah. ” “My friend has the English version. ” “Oh. Didn’t know there was one. ” “This is all in German. ” “I know. ” “The guy in this band is the guy from Devo, so he knows English. ” I scratch my head. “Hot Topic bag’s falling apart,” she says, “That’s my favorite store. ” She leaves in Omaha to transfer buses. She had, while we were traveling, continually, loudly “Let’s get going!” Middle of nowhere, Nebraska—last cigarette gone, restrooms are flooded. Nice-looking girl smokes a bit, I think she’d be fun to talk to but we’re on different buses anyway. Group of youths—”Have any good drugs?” “No, actually, I don’t. Is that just a random question?” “Just a random question. ” “Just thought we’d ask,” laughs another girl. “Have any hard drugs?” asks another guy. I go in and buy a Diet Coke. On bus before Omaha I’d been plotting songs in my head, in Omaha worked on writing down some of the lyrics. In N. Y. C. , I had written to V. This is a long bus ride. Day 3. In Denver I shave, bum a smoke from a woman who had been on my bus up to that point. It’s a Vanilla flavored Light Slim 100. Yeah. It’s bad. I ask a youngun dressed in a nice long black coat if I can have one for later. He gives me two. 89 V. had lit a gazillion candles in her room and it was late night and we lay next to each other but then heard footsteps and I was told to hide but instead I just acted like I was asleep. So her father opened the door, looked at us, saw us in bed, saw all the candles, then slammed the door back shut. I was shaking. 90 On a different night, V. and I rented a hotel room, but after Mischa pushed the issue we gave in and said that okay, she could come there for a little bit. She came with something like three friends, who were treating it as a hotel room party. Eventually V. had to talk to Mischa and say that she needed to take these people and leave so that we could have our night in privacy. 91 When I had once again overstayed my welcome at V. ’s parents’ house, V. and Mischa arranged for me to stay with a guy they knew somewhat, whom I had never met before. He talked to me about the local punk scene and played me various 45s. It was all pleasant enough until he ran out of weed and ended up on the telephone, aggressively trying to get some more. “Do you know who you’re talking to?” he shouted into the phone, citing his importance to the local punk scene. 92 My mother then agreed to pay for a weekly hotel that I could stay in until I figured out how to work and live in Bakersfield. 93 I had my web site, still, which I updated. V. had one, too. She still half-heartedly moderated her old poetry web ring. She would say to me, “Hey, I posted a new poem” and I’d get all excited. I put new writings up pretty much every day, but hers were more of a rarity. 94 V. said, not infrequently, that my writing made her feel inferior. I didn’t understand. Her work was a good influence on mine, which had grown manic and at times too experimental for its own good. 95 This country does not want me to exist. I can’t get an apartment (even with a parent supporting me from Massachusetts) without a job; I can’t get a job without a work permit; I’m not supposed to get a work permit without being enrolled in a Bakersfield school. I called one school district office and they told me I couldn’t do anything; I called another one and they transferred me to the Student Services Department, where I was told someone else would call me back. I’m a nothing. 96 I wake up and want to smoke. Do, standing, muscles reactive, cleaning lady down the hall within sight. I flick my ashes over the edge so as to leave them scattered. I return to my room (I couldn’t find the key/left Mr. Tree, my stuffed Christmas tree, as a doorstop) collapse onto bed feeling as though drunk. (Exhaustion first thing in the morning, and deeply) I reluctantly head to the bathroom because I feel I am about to vomit. I hold it down, however, and I wish. That I were in L. A. with V. I could be looking at Van Gogh. When I awoke it was about the time when I would expect the bus should have been arriving. 97 A shot of vodka. doesn’t taste very good. I wish I were somewhere. Something. Maybe in another land. It’s early. 98 According to Maxine, I’m a lot like The Man who Fell to Earth. I think I’m more like the Elephant Man. 99 I wonder what my favorite color would be if I had a favorite color. Without the desperation a romanticizediesin you. Si, and I. Sip in the complex of a wheatfield filled with those crows I loathe to speaking to, while I stand to a park back in Mass and the swings are a mess of a confines so aging is a partial concept if I had, without the possibility to do a number of things like the messina throngs of love, or perhaps that a company might in the appreciation that grows greater all the ahdults spew for their realization a mite too late, and the truth comes elate that you shouldn’t drop out of school and you shouldn’t start smoking, and you know why? Because they never tell you why. 100 I go back the Bay Area and Maxine’s house. 101 April 21, 1999. In one day, one hour and one quarter… I will be an adult. 102 Maxine came and picked me up from the San Francisco bus terminal. She was with her friend Erin. The two of them arrived late. In the car, after making it known that they both had been drinking, Maxine lit up a clove cigarette and said “Levi, because of you I’ve become a chain smoker. ” I remember how far back she and cloves went: talking to her online, still back when she was involved with Jason and before I had gone out to California for the first time, I remember her saying that she had mentioned to Jason that she was going to try cloves. His disapproval pissed her off. When she and I were in Massachusetts, the obsession with cloves continued: I remember her mentioning how it was the kind of thing you would see the super-cool European goth girls smoking—and how they were often times black, making them even cooler. 103 We would ride as passengers in Erin’s car into San Francisco at night, up and down hills where vehicles parked on either side of the street and peep shows and Michelob signs and movie theaters competed for our attention. 104 Up in Maxine’s room, we had some of her father’s musical equipment. I was able to use his electric guitar, multi-effects pedal, drum machine and mixer. We piped it through to the computer. We improvised an album. Her brother was involved. I would sing crazily while Maxine would talk about absurd things. MP3. com allowed anyone to upload their music files. We took a pre-existing picture of her and she did my makeup and dressed me up for a rock star picture of me, so that we could have a band photo on the page. The project name was Levi Adams and the Ubiquitous Null. "

(Maxine subsequently thought to email the Palo Alto City Council, telling them about the Radiohead b-side named after their city. They emailed back, saying that they would be interested to learn more, but they stopped responding once she sent them the lyrics. ) We also attended a Stabbing Westward concert, although we left midway through their set because we had mostly been there to see the opening act, Placebo. And we saw Velvet Goldmine in the theater. 106 liquor me up and be grossly informed.   Am I caught in no web and lifelessly achieve a raincoat of soul are we clothed 107 May 10, 1999. I woke up, I sat around, I used the computer a little, I sat around some more, used the computer a little more, sat around some more. I went for a walk at one point, listening to Ben Folds Five’s The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner. I walked to the park that’s close to the house here, into the kiddie section and onto the play structures. I remembered how, in a different time, my unfamiliarity with the territory and the darkness of night, it had seemed like an entirely different place. Also, just the other day, when I had been sitting in this same area, listening to this same album, a guy had approached and sat immediately across from me. As the schoolchildren passed, he had whispered to me, “Hey, got any weed?” and I, accustomed to being asked this question by strangers, had replied simply, “No, I don’t. ” But no one sketchy appeared to me in the park today. 108 May 12, 1999. 1:16 AM. When I awaken and look at the clock, I wish it were later. These days it seems like I’m always trying my best to get on a schedule where I won’t be awake at the same time as Maxine. I need to have time to myself, to my thoughts; I need to use the computer and to write. I went for a walk this evening… thoughtless and wandering, late at night, the kitties are out and stalk and prowl and I… stand out. An objection to the stillness. Random but an alarming reminder to the kitties that they. Are never. Safe. Singing to myself, as I’ve done in the past. Admiring the quiver in my voice and the general color of it all. Someday I’ll take place with guitar in hand and show what I’ve found in the dank regions of my solitude-without-privacy. It’s beautiful to approach others, and it’s beautiful to see what they have. A bundle of impulses in the form of memory, stimulating in this form and that… so why not? Why not reach out, and why not find what has been waiting in there for so long? Even the most seemingly content, the most sociable, will be disarmed by what they’ve been searching for their entire lives—genuine, loving interest and empathy. It’s too bad that’s all I can ever give to them. 109 May 11, 1999. Heading outside for a smoke as we are supposed to be doing all the time instead of smoking in the room. Robert’s friend, who has been been staying with us because she has nowhere else to go, asks to use our matches. She pulls some weed out from under her shirt, held in the wrapper that comes around a cigarette pack. I ask her why she’s stuffing it there. It’s because she doesn’t trust Robert. Robert comes walking back with an oil painting he did and a sketch someone drew of him. “Wow,” I say, “I never knew that you did anything artistic, Robert. That’s pretty. ” Maxine assures me that doing oil paintings of landscapes is simple and that he, just as she, had only followed the simple instructions offered by the teacher. 110 May 13, 1999. As she does often, Maxine makes the polite request that I go for a walk and allow her some time to herself. She hands me a few dollars so that I can purchase batteries for the walkman, but I find that the ones I picked up off the dresser work just fine and purchase a soda with the money instead. Walking past the shopping center with a slight but faded uneasiness at the teenagers standing around, my mind begins to fantasize about how enthralling it would be to stand, anywhere, for any reason, with anyone, performing anything. I walk by an old man and nod. He glares. I smile. I awake around three in the afternoon to find Maxine, as usual, at her position in front of the computer. I casually ask if she has accomplished anything noteworthy during my hibernation. “No,” she responds, “Everyone fucking hates me. ” Nodding, I put my head back to the pillow and await finding the strength to move again. We drive to the mall as an answer to her cravings for food and cigarettes. I offer to buy us a pack of cloves, since for the longest time she refused to smoke anything else. Pondering whether or not to buy a slice of pizza, she eventually declares that it’s too expensive and she would rather go to Wendy’s. “Wendy’s?” I say, “I thought that you weren’t eating meat anymore. ” “Well… just for one last time. I really want a hamburger. ” I get a slice of cheese pizza from Sbarro’s and a drink from Orange Julius. We head outside. We head home, forgetting about the Wendy’s idea. We continue our tradition of one of us using the computer while the other watches prerecorded tapes of music videos. Eventually she remembers that she was hungry and we finally go to Wendy’s. She only orders fries, saying that to prevent herself from eating meat she thinks about how the cow might have been the reincarnation of John Lennon. She doesn’t want to eat John Lennon. 111 I talked to Socks today. She mentioned that she was getting candy. “Ah,” I said, “Candy. ” “Yes, candy… riceboy,” she said, and then proceeded to call me anorexic. I eventually convinced her that I am not anorexic. She apologized for using the word, said that she didn’t realize I held such an aversion to it. 112 I leave for Bakersfield early tomorrow morning (Saturday). Another whoosh, another turn of events to forget in the future. It gets me thinking, as do all things—that youth is a prize, that the timeline of your past becomes skewered until you can’t remember how many places you’ve lived, how many things you’ve done, how may people you’ve been, without making a strenuous and conscious effort to try and get it all straight. 113 Waiting for the interview at the temp agency. None of the actual jobs I’ve applied to have responded at all, as per usual. The details of my latest Bakersfield occurrence are beginning to mush together. No one’s really been notified of how it went—myself included. “You have no idea how much I try to make things so that you’d want to stay here with me,” says Maxine, “I keep trying and trying and I don’t want you to hate me, but it always seems like you want to be with everyone else more than me because I’m not worth anything. ” 114 I talked with my old friend Aaron’s girlfriend, Scientist Jen, last night. (I haven’t seen Aaron for about three years now outside of the online realms. ) She and I talked for awhile and it was a fast-paced, clever conversation. 115 Soon it will be July. The world is spinning. I am dizzy and weak. I am listening to a soundtrack of shoveling and the ranting of Maxine’s mother from outside. Socks wanted me to see her friend’s band, The Music Tapes, when they played in Northampton… but this is a different coast, where saws are more shy to sing. 116 The idea in my head was that I was operating autonomously. I was establishing myself as an individual who was moving to Bakersfield, who also just happened to be in love with somebody who lived there. Which was not to say that the person I was in love with was actually my girlfriend. I was feeling like there were a lot of things going on in V. ’s life that I either didn’t understand or didn’t know about. There was a guy named John and there was Tara and there were other people going swimming or going to hot tubs, whatever, and I wouldn’t be able to hang out with this circle of friends because John didn’t like me and he and V. had maybe had a thing going? And what’s up with me, this guy coming from Massachusetts? What’s he doing here? I was living out of a hotel that rented rooms by the week, watching reruns of Webster on the television. I would walk and bus to everywhere I needed to go. I stocked up on cereal and pasta, which I would prepare in the hotel room. V. and I had one particular store from which we bought our cigarettes. After we had become regulars, they would never card us. And there was this guy who I think liked V. And I let him sleep on the floor of my hotel room the night after Alie broke up with him. And I awoke to a punch in the face. I asked him what the hell that was for. He said, “I must have done it in my sleep. I should leave now. ” And then he left. And I needed work, so I applied to everything. I wrote out a resume on the computer at V. ’s house. I went for interviews. An Internet friend of V. ’s came to visit. He was older than we were by a few years. He lived a few hours away and worked some sort of tech job. He brought vodka and wine coolers from the Safeway. We drank those and chatted in my hotel room. I could smoke in the room, but I still went outside in the morning to have a cigarette under the sunlight when I could just barely see the smoke as it rose. I remember the day when we broke up. She was surprised that I even called it that. We never called each other by referential labels, but one thing I couldn’t be was a teenage liar. Caleb came and he said Here I’m going to drive you somewhere and he told me to hop over this fence. Don’t worry. People did it all the time. He was just supportive. Of course I thought that there could be a Bakersfield without V. , because it wasn’t just about her. People were extending kindness and listening—really listening—and wow, well, it seemed of their own volition and all. This was enough for me to feel like I’d transcended everything that I had known of this world and what I thought were its wicked ways. Why did it happen? Was it not working out? Was I ever going to find Home? How long until the next hug and how rough should my defenses become? Then Caleb left me in the bedroom of some nice girl I had never met before. He stayed away for hours, when he was supposed to just be gone for a little bit. It was sweet, kind of, but I didn’t just get to like people, in that way, in the span of a couple hours. I don’t even remember much about when V. called 9-1-1 about me. I remember friends had been coming over to her house. They were all going to do something. I was so upset the way it was going and I was so upset that I wasn’t included. I took an assertive stance while I grabbed my bag and I said “Well, I guess there’s just no logical choice left but to kill myself then, right?” I don’t know why, but I do know that I ran across the street and jumped on the barrier between the lanes then jumped back down onto the street with great force, crying just a little and falling into little fits of rushed expletives and stopping at the convenience store for cigarettes and went back to the hotel and the phone rang and it was you and you said softly that you had been trying to reach me. I was like, “Oh, hey, I stopped to buy cigarettes,” but there was something odd about your voice because you spoke slowly as though you were stalling for time stalling stalling but then you knew when to say it exactly on cue like in a film: “I made a phone call, because I thought you might need some help. ” Knock. Knock. I answered the door. Two officers. I said that this was a misunderstanding. They said to me that I could come willingly or that they would force me to come with them. So, in handcuffs again, I was in the back of the cop car until the ambulance came. I sat in silence, riding through the city to the hospital. They took my possessions and put them into a little bag. They wanted me to sign a paper that said what I had in my little bag. I didn’t sign anything. They let me bring the book that I was reading at the time, The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus. Mostly that night was waiting. They wouldn’t let me have a smoke. I waited and talked to I think it was three different people who evaluated me, interviewed me as I smiled with charisma. The man in overalls stained with blood, his arm bandaged up, who completely failed to acknowledge his own situation when he said to me in a fatherly sort of way that life is really worth living and that I just needed to roll with the punches. And the old woman who wanders in and out everywhere she can and comes right up and says, “They’re drugging us, you know. They’re putting drugs in our water. ” Then she looks as if she’s reading you, to see whether you understand. She leaves as slowly as she approached. There is what looks to be dried-up blood on the walls. I am let out early the next morning. V. and Caleb picked me up. I was hanging out at V. ’s house, while her parents were having just another morning. I was pretending that nothing had happened. "

    "body": "1 “I’ve corrected the homework,” my French instructor, who was referred to as Madame, said to the class one day. “And Levi, yours was very interesting. You have a girlfriend and a boyfriend?” “Really!” said Brielle excitedly, “I didn’t know that about you!” Brielle was the woman with a sophisticated-sounding voice, who usually sat next to me. I slid back in my seat to hide. “I was just being silly,” I mumbled. “I don’t really. ” On several occasions that semester, Brielle proposed that we should study together sometime. On those occasions I would just mumble, “Yeahokaysoundsgood!” and nothing would come of it. I didn’t understand. She was twenty-three and pretty and confident. I was eighteen going on nineteen and socially awkward and I figured that it would be crazy to think she would have interest in me. 2 Jenny: “Do you have a cigarette?” at HCC. And did I like Kerouac? She always saw me writing into notebooks around campus, she said. She liked black and white movies, Jim Morrison, and leopard print. We talked for long enough that she lit another cigarette: “Oops, I forgot, I really did have a lighter after all. ” We exchanged email addresses. 3 Rachel B. was someone else I met through my Love@AOL personal ad. We met at Javanet in Northampton, as I recall. She had a car, so had driven to see me. We went to visit her friend at his dorm at UMass Amherst. She had a CD player and a booklet full of CDs, but I also brought some of my own collection. She wasn’t very familiar with Tori Amos, so I played her the live version of the song “Cooling” from To Venus and Back. She said she would look into her. Her friend at UMass had homework to do, so he sat at his desk while Rachel and I cuddled on the lower bunk a pair of bunk beds. After leaving her friend’s room, we went walking around the campus for a bit. The night was a bit chilly, but this meant it was fairly private for us. We walked around the pond. Back in my bedroom we ended up on my waterbed. We kissed there, and our clothes were coming off when she stopped and said, “I don’t think I’d feel right. What I mean to say is I don’t think I want to, y’know, go all the way. ” I hugged her and said okay, that that would have been moving really quickly anyway. 4 The previous acting class was just getting dismissed. Someone had randomly given me a bag of Jolly Ranchers candy, so I was handing the candies out to anyone I encountered. This was how I first met Liv. “You’re cute. I’d do you,” she said. When I got out of class, she was walking through the hallway outside the theater. She talked to me for a bit and gave me her number. 5 I skipped class one day so that I could keep talking to Jenny. She and I had retreated to a relatively private section of the campus. We picked apart the fallen autumn leaves, sat and smoked cigarettes. 	Then Liv approached. You couldn’t miss her in her red and black coat. She and Jenny hit it off. We sat around talking for a while. 6 One day at school, Jenny suggested that I meet her at work—the JC Penney Department Store, in the Holyoke Mall—when she was going out. I could come along with her and her friends, as they were going to Haven, the goth club night in Northampton. This was the same club Maxine and I had tried to go to about a year earlier. I said to Jenny that I would try to make it, but she was still surprised when I actually showed up. We rode from the mall in her car to her friend’s house. Photo Jay was there. (I would be acquainted with him vaguely for a while after. ) I applied makeup in the bathroom. I borrowed her friend’s skirt, which was black and long and layered and perfect for me. I was already wearing a black t-shirt, so with that I had an outfit. At the club, I spent most of my time sticking next to Jenny and one of her friends. I knelt while they scratched my head. They went to dance; I wasn’t quite ready to join them yet, so I tried to strike up conversation with a girl who happened to be next to me. “Tee-hee,” she said, “I can’t talk to strangers without my master here with me. ” She tee-hee’d in response to anything further that I tried to say. 7 Liv’s catch phrase was, “We need eggs”. She often said it with a groan or a roll of the eyes when someone said something that she found ridiculous. Only years later would I learn that this was not some nonsense phrase she had made up, but that it was clearly a reference to the soliloquy Woody Allen’s character gives at the end of the movie Annie Hall: It reminds me of that old joke- you know, a guy walks into a psychiatrist's office and says, hey doc, my brother's crazy! He thinks he's a chicken. Then the doc says, why don't you turn him in? Then the guy says, I would but I need the eggs. I guess that's how I feel about relationships. They're totally crazy, irrational, and absurd, but we keep going through it because we need the eggs. 8 Liv’s bedroom was meticulously clean. Her CDs were all in their cases and stored on a CD rack. She talked to me about Liz Phair, The Vagina Monologues, Diane Arbus, and Bust magazine. She talked a lot—and not just to people close to her—about having Tourette’s syndrome (mostly eye blinks, about as obvious as my own) and obsessive compulsive disorder. She also talked about having multiple personalities; on occasion she would have what looked a bit like a minor seizure, and she would then say, “Hello. What were we talking about? I just changed over from one of my other personalities. ” The morning after my first visit to her house, the two of us woke up to a knock on her bedroom door. It was her mother, saying that she knew the door had been locked while Liv and I had shared the bed, and they were going to have to ask me to leave the house. “Well, if you have to go, I’m coming with you,” she said to me. Her father soon tracked us down, though, to say that he and wife had not known Liv felt so strongly about me, and that I would be welcome in their house in the future. 9 As a follow up to the improvisational recordings I had done in California with Maxine and her brother—which I had released through MP3. com under the title (Not Really): An EP—I put together, through a monotonous process of cutting, pasting, and editing wave files using free software, a CD of sound collage and electronic instrumental pieces, which I called Fractured and Digital. I still used the band name Levi Adams and the Ubiquitous Null. 10 Around this time I was hired to Target. I had filled out the application at a little computer terminal in the store. Since I didn’t know which position I would like—I would accept any, I figured—I chose the one that seemed most ridiculous, figuring that, if I got the interview, I would discuss the matter of which position might be best for me. As it turned out, I was hired for the position to which I applied. I started work, then, in Assets Protection as a Protections Specialist. I stood at the door and checked people’s bags when they set off the alarms. I was also an eye in the sky to the cashiers: I was told to watch them and to occasionally give them notice either of something that they did particularly well or something that they didn’t do particularly well. I lasted there for maybe two months, then quit, using the excuse that I was working too many hours while also in school. 11 I met Marie through the Love@AOL personals. She already had a boyfriend. For a while we were late night telephone buddies. She did most of the talking. I liked it that way. She talked about knowing the future in advance and funny web sites. The first time the two of us planned to meet, I took a bus to Springfield. I had never been to the location—a Friendly’s Ice Cream on Sumner Ave. —so as soon as the bus reached the first Friendly’s I saw, I got off the bus and wandered in. Cara and her boyfriend Doug, both of whom I knew from HCC, were inside. They said, “Hey!” and invited me to sit with them. I explained my situation and after they were done eating they drove me to the other Friendly’s, which was only about a mile down the street. I knew that I was supposed to see Marie and her stuffed polar bear, named Whitey. I looked around. I guess I did so timidly, but I couldn’t see a stuffed polar bear anywhere until I had been out front of the restaurant for a bit. The weather descended into cold. I thought that maybe she would still show up… then I finally noticed Whitey and said hey to her. She was 17, about a year younger than I was. We chatted for a bit about Joe Strummer and the Violent Femmes. She already had a ride coming, so I was driven home. She sat in the back seat, next to me, while we continued a lively conversation. Semi-regularly following that, I would arrange to meet her again, at “Little Sumner”, as she called it. She was in good with all the waitstaff and we’d get freebies and someone random would come by and say to her, “Hey, so did you drop out of school?” and she’d say yeah and then she’d speak something in some other language and say things out of left field and there would be laughter and then the other person would leave and she’d look at me without changing the tone of her voice and say, “I’m in such bad shape. ” 12 I was getting more comfortable with hanging out casually in the green room at HCC. One day, I left my Academy guitar there while I went to class, and when I returned I found someone playing a riff from a Nine Inch Nails song on it. The guy in question was Jonny. I recognized the song he was playing, and this led to the two of us having a conversation about music. 13 In Jenny’s car it was all about Pearl Jam and Guns n’ Roses. We would drive here or there, then she would park in front of my house and say that we should sit there for awhile. She would recline her seat and we would talk, maybe cuddle. Judging by my memories, the moon was always full, that Autumn of ‘99. 14 Jenny, Liv and I all started going places together—like that little diner in West Springfield that I had never been to before. Talking about people, although we didn’t know many people in common. Back then, the Pioneer Valley didn’t seem so small. The young guy who worked there set down ashtrays for us, in defiance of a recently-passed city ordinance. We smoked and laughed our way through the late night. “We’re transcending reality,” said Liv, next to me in the diner booth, when I looked into her eyes and we began to say things about children and impending doom, which only we could think that we understood. Jenny said that she felt left out when Liv and I transcended reality. 15 By a graveyard, Jenny parked her car. She rolled down the windows and left the car doors open and blasted loud music. We could see our breath. We didn’t worry about cops: they believed in their safety, and I believed that their safety extended to me, too. I leaned over Liv as she sat on the ground. Our bodies pressed against each other. Jenny stood nearby and watched clouds wisp through the sky. Liv asked me whether I had seen that ghost in the graveyard. I responded that I hadn’t. 16 Inspired by the one-act plays being written by my peers in the Drama Club, I started working on my own. I wrote a large chunk of a first draft of what I was calling Memory of a Nightmare. 17 [Scene 1] (Lights fade in. Robert lies in bed, in the garb of a small child ready to go nite-nite. Anastasia enters and approaches his bed. ) ANASTASIA: Bobby. My sweet, perfect little angel. For so many years I’ve come to your aid, and for so many years the world has continued to resist you. Even through my imbuements of strength the negative forces have pushed onward, so that after all I’ve tried still you remain in suffering. But one of these nights, Bobby. One of these nights, staring upward, you will appreciate the stars to see that they’re not the distant and unreachable objects of science and rhetoric. One of these nights you’ll look out your window, past the treetops, and spread apart over billions of light years you’ll watch these spherical deities as they call to you. You’ll understand, for the first time, as entire constellations defy gravity to take shape and to spell out your name. As you look unto these figures, you’ll look into yourself, and you’ll see that there’s never been a difference at all. You’ll see that it’s always been here, within you, just waiting to be released. Maybe it won’t be tonight, and maybe it won’t be tomorrow night, but sometime you will see. You’ll see that there are no limits for you, Bobby. The whole universe can be yours for the taking if you just let them fade. Let them fade, as would the memory of a nightmare. (Anastasia exits; Robert slowly rises from the bed and removes his pajamas to reveal an outfit representative of himself as an adult. ) 18 I then decided to use a different structure for the play. I began re-writing the whole thing. "

    "body": "19 “You’re all neat and tidy today,” said Tingley. “Yes, I am, I suppose. Hair tied back and all. ” “Do you have a scene in Sheryl’s class or something?” “No, no. This is just how I showed up today. ” “Are you taking my advice about fooling them?” “Uh, no. I’m just… wearing what I’m wearing. ” “Because it works, you know. ” He gave me a look, then, as if he were revealing his true, devious nature. “Does it. ” “Yup. Anyway, have a good day. ” And he turned and walked away. 20 Liv habitually paid for my lunch, paid for my soda from the vending machine. She wrote the beginnings of a play whose characters were her multiple personalities arguing with each other about the past. 21 On the couch in my living room. We had the house to ourselves that night. I had rented the movie Sweethearts, with Janeane Garofalo. Liv and I were in funny positions on the couch. We stared into each other’s eyes for long periods of time, transcending reality. She said, “You always win when we do that.  It scares me”. 22 Then, Jenny all of a sudden started to avoid me and Liv. We started seeing her more and more with a certain guy who also went to our school. 23 Marie said that I should meet Maurice sometime. We’d get along. Both he and I owned cellos. (I had bought a cheap plywood model from an online auction. ) Maurice was the guitarist and co-songwriter for her band, The Basement. 24 The turn of the millennium is approaching quickly, and the quietness of it all is funny in a way. “There are only five weeks left,” I’ll tell people, and they’ll be struck into alertness with a quick response of “Really? It’s that close?” A horrible TV movie about Y2K was on the other night. I found it hilarious. 25 I saw Tori Amos in concert and made profound eye contact with about half the audience members, including one whose eyes were suddenly, intensely, and unintentionally interlocked with mine.  “Congratulations,” said Liv, apparently noticing her reaction afterward. “You were just checked out by a hot chick. ” 26 Life this semester began with my walking around. For several days prior to the start of classes I went to HCC every day, to get re-accustomed to the atmosphere. 27 Scientist Jen—the used-to-be-girlfriend of my friend from elementary and middle school, Aaron—recognized me one day at HCC and introduced herself. (I had emailed her a photo of me. ) 28 One day I realized that I was friends with most of the Drama Club, and I started hanging out in the green room with them. 29 Today I got to school around 8:30 in the morning because I had a scene to perform with Liv in front of the instructor Sheryl Stoodley. She wasn’t there when I arrived, and I had heard Scientist Jen DJing on the radio in the car, so I went to the campus radio station and spoke on the radio with her a bit, making her play three Levi Adams and the Ubiquitous Null tracks (“American Incision”, “Dolphin Techno”, and “I am a Starving Web Designer. Help. ”) Then I went back to the C building, and Liv still wasn’t there. I talked to Sheryl and she said, “I figured Liv would be here, but I was worried that you might not show up. ” I giggled to myself: Liv was always late. I called Liv’s number from the phone in the performing arts office. There was no answer. As soon as I got off, though, I saw her walking over outside. We practiced the scene for a bit, then went into the acting lab and performed for Sheryl. “So this is just you, and Levi’s going to be there to support you? No? He has dialogue? Okay. Well, at least you wrote the scene. No? You didn’t write it? Oh. Well, it’s good that you picked something out. He picked it out? Oh, okay. ” It went no better than I had expected, considering that we hadn’t rehearsed enough. Then I had to get to my play production class for The Catch, the one-act play we were doing. It went decently. As we smoked cigarettes afterward, James lifted up his shirt so that I could sign his chest “Fisherman #5” in marker. 30 I knew that I wanted to be with V. for New Year’s 2000. Was it going to be the end of civilization as we knew it? Would the Y2K computer glitch cause civilization to fall into anarchy? My bus reached the Rocky Mountains and the elevation started to shift. My gums went numb. When do gums go numb?! I had been over this terrain before without problem! What was wrong?! “Does anyone have any… vitamins or anything?” I asked loudly to the other bus passengers. I received some chuckles, but no vitamins. It kept getting worse. I felt light-headed and sick. I thought that I was going to throw up. I knelt over the toilet in the little bumpity bumpity restroom at the rear of the coach, but I wasn’t vomiting. I worried that I might die there, but asserted to myself that no, no, I wouldn’t, I couldn’t, because that wouldn’t make any sense. I would see V. again—at least once more. So I felt better until the Cheyenne terminal. Then, I thought that I could understand a few words that some Spanish-speaking guys were saying. They were saying terrible things about me, scornful things, and they sent looks of evil at me. So uncomfortable, and this was the cross-country route, who knew how long they’d be on the bus? How much time would they have in which to plot against me?! I wanted to be away from them and from their looks of evil. Unfortunately, Cheyenne gets very windy, and it seemed a wonder that the doors didn’t break daily at that terminal. I was stuck inside there and then back on the bus one of them sat next to me! Through the night, when most people were sleeping, all I could hear (as I wore my headphones but kept the volume almost off so that I could listen in while they thought I couldn’t hear at all) was him talking to his friends. I thought I heard him saying that he hated French people with their café au lait and baguettes. We got to Las Vegas around 1 AM and we had forty-five minutes to waste. One of the Spanish speakers used a pay phone looking like a secret agent and glancing over to me—to keep an eye on where I was! I needed cigarettes. An old homeless man asked me if I had a cigarette. I said no, but did he know where I could buy some? He said sure and led me away from the hustle and bustle into a dark area past closed businesses and run-down apartment buildings. We got to the gas station and I bought a pack from the man behind the bullet-proof glass. I walked a few strides ahead of the homeless guy. We were walking in the opposite direction as a group of young males. One of these guys said something to me and I said “Hm?” because I didn’t hear. He repeated, but still all I could tell was that he had asked me a question. “No, thanks,” I replied. The homeless man said to me, in a hushed exclamation, “Don’t talk to him! Are you stupid? He was trying to sell you crack. You don’t do that stuff, do you?” and I said no. I had already given the homeless man a cigarette or two, so I hurried to cross the street to return to the bus terminal. The people I was afraid were following me were not on my bus from Las Vegas to Bakersfield. 31 From the Greyhound station I took a city bus to try to head vaguely in the direction of V. ’s house. However, I took the bus in the wrong direction, so that where I ended up didn’t actually look like city anymore. Sand blew around and got into my hair and eyes. It was more like the setting of a Western movie than a city. I called V. from a grocery store. She groaned; I was far away. I had with me some bags of possessions and my guitar. I played bits of songs that I was trying to write, there in front of the grocery store. Some little kids asked if they could try my guitar. I said sure. I told them to hold the strings with the left hand, then to strum with the right hand. A woman came up and asked the kids whether they knew who I was, and when they said no, she told them to go back home. She apologized to me, said that it wasn’t anything personal, but she wouldn’t want her kids hanging out with a stranger like that. V. had a car, and she had her friend Silvia with her. This was my first time meeting her. We packed my stuff in the car and zoomed off. There was a hurry to get to somewhere. I forget exactly to where. V. had a boyfriend again. His name was Jonathan. It was unclear to me what was happening with all that. 32 It felt like the whole of time was ending. There was music in my head, always. We were eating at a Bickford’s restaurant. I stepped outside alone for a cigarette. I sang part of a song that I never completed. Nothing was going to happen between me and V. , maybe. She was with Jonathan, maybe. 33 Going to the apartment of someone named Jasmine. She was a friend of Silvia, I guess. We all sat around and drank white wine. Silvia was playing and singing PJ Harvey songs: “Ooooooh ohhhhh ohhhhhh you’re deeee viiiii eeeeeeene…” I got into excited conversation with Jasmine about something. V. was moody on the floor. We were offered Jasmine’s bed to sleep in, so then it was just V. and me in this bedroom, which was somehow already set up, perfect in its mood, dark but very candlelit. Candles everywhere. A canopy bed with drapery. V. and I shared talk about something, how she was kind of jealous of the way I had been talking to Jasmine. She had removed some article or articles of clothing, for sleep. I asked about Jonathan. She groaned, like, why was I worrying about this? The candles cast shadows on us. There was an understanding between herself and Jonathan, she said. I remember being groggy in the morning, when Silvia entered the room to wake us up. Before leaving that day, we watched Fleetwood Mac’s live reunion concert, The Dance, on videocassette. Lindsey Buckingham played a solo, possibly to “Landslide”, and Silvia said to me, out of nowhere, “That’s what I see in you. ” 34 The open mic at the coffee shop was always packed. There was great applause when Silvia played the songs she had written. I had never really hung out at a coffee shop before. Jonathan was often there. He smoked Kamel Red cigarettes. He had long dark hair and wore a long dark jacket. The light was always a dim red on the patio there, though you could also see the sky. Sometimes there was music. You always knew that you were there hiding away from the rest of the city. 35 Silvia played her songs on V. ’s mom’s old guitar. The guitar was out of tune and the strings were ancient. Silvia didn’t care. She made it work for her. She worked on new lyrics for weeks, a little bit at a time. 36 It was just me and Silvia one time. We went to her house. Rather, it was her mother’s house, and she was staying there at the time, sometimes, when she wasn’t sleeping out. Silvia had moved around. She had lived in other parts of California. Here she shared a room with her brothers. She had her own bed. There was another bed next to it, which three of her little brothers were sharing. On the wall was a large poster—a grade school project by one of them? About Christmas in America. The words were about all the lights, and the toys in store windows. Silvia’s family was from Mexico. Silvia had been born there. 37 I installed the proper software onto V. ’s computer, so that Silvia would be able to record some songs. Silvia took right away to the idea of recording her songs. Even though it was late at night, she bellowed out an uncompromised performance. V. and Silvia collaborated a little and continued, over the next week or so, to record songs without my help. 38 One night, somebody invited us (me, V. , Jonathan, Silvia, and a nice male friend of theirs) to their parents’ place for hot tubbing. The car we were riding in stopped at a gas station before we went to the house. V. took me aside and asked, “Are you comfortable with this?” “Not really,” I replied. “I can have you dropped off at my house if you want,” she offered. “No, I would rather be there with you. ” Unfortunately, several hours into the night, the parents who owned the place and who were supposed to be out of town returned home early and found us partying inside their home. We had to get a ride to Jonathan’s house. As V. exited the car, she leaned over to vomit. I held her still wet hair while she vomited onto the drainage grate at the side of the road. We went inside the house, then. The nice friend of theirs was going to sleep early on a couch in the living room. Silvia, heating up a kettle, offered me tea. I said that tea sounded great. Silvia told Jonathan and V. to go up to Jonathan’s room to sleep. They did. Once they were gone and it was just me and Silvia, I confided that I had feelings about those sleeping arrangements. “Well,” replied Silvia, “V. is in a relationship with Jonathan. She kind of has a relationship with you, too, sure, but that’s a different thing. ” I don’t know what I said in response, but I remember that we were drinking jasmine tea. "

    "body": "39 On New Year’s Eve, the television showed celebrations around the world. No tragedy or apocalypse was being reported. Mischa, V. , Silvia, and I took a trip to San Francisco, to an apartment where some people originally from Bakersfield lived. A nice place. Decorated. Chips. Drinks. Beck’s Midnite Vultures. We chatted with the people who were there, but as the hour approached I told V. that I really thought we should find a public celebration to attend. Ball-dropping, mobs of people, and all that. No one knew for sure exactly where that would be, but V. , Silvia, and I took a bus and just followed the mobs. A hippie-looking girl with a dog and a blanket remarked that there were so many people, why were they all out and so excited? What was the big deal? We passed increasing amounts of police in riot gear, until we got there, to the big crowd of people in the streets, who were smooshed together near some big stage. Music was playing. We had a bottle of wine with us. Deep in the crowd, we opened the bottle before the turning. Between the three of us, the bottle was devoured quickly. I began to cry as soon as the clock struck. Such a simple thing as the year having a “2” at the beginning of it struck me as being so unreasonable. I hadn’t expected to live to see it. Every time I tried to process that it was January 1 of the year 2000, I bawled harder, kissing V. so much, and hugging, and we hugged Silvia, too, and then there was dancing in the street, and laughing, laughing, and the sort of jubilation I couldn’t have expected ever to know, for about forty-five minutes as the crowd was yeah! and woo! and the music was celebratory and I forget what was playing but it didn’t matter, random songs over the speakers, nods and smiles to the strangers nearby. I had made it. Just as I had wished for so strongly. I had spent this time with V. V. asked Silvia how she was doing. Silvia was sitting on the curb, staring outward. She said that she missed someone, that watching us together made her think about this person—a woman from her past, a lover. Then there was the walk back. Much of the crowd had dispersed by the time we made our return trip. We found a city bus to take back in the general direction of the apartment complex. People on the bus were passing around a bowl and a lighter. We waited for another bus we were hoping we could take, but it had stopped running. Fortunately, a taxi van picked us up and took us where we were going for five dollars. We all stayed in San Francisco the next day, and maybe the day after, too. 40 Back in Bakersfield, inspired by Silvia’s songwriting, I wrote my first song for guitar and vocals, called “Crossing the Line”. 41 I remember Harland’s apartment. Harland was another longhair. V. would get involved with him later on, and she would live in that apartment with him. What I remember is him sitting at his computer, playing games. Some girls I didn’t know there. Everyone singing along to Poe’s “Fly Away”. 42 A certain occasion between V. and me. On her bed. What I remember of it is that she looked at me and said, “My God. I could really see myself spending the rest of my life with you. ” 43 And then I spent another three days on Greyhound buses. 44 “Hi, this is Lydia with psychic talk. Do you have a question for one of our psychics?” I close the door. My mommy is sleeping with the late night infomercials on. I walk at my accelerated pace to my room. I’ve just woken up. I have two dollars and some change. The closest open restaurant is Denny’s, over two miles away. I seriously consider going, for the lack of anything better towards which to endeavor. Sometimes, when it’s just me and my mommy at home, I exit my room like being expelled from an addiction. Then I lie on the floor and make animal noises. She continues to watch sitcoms. “How are you doing?’ she asks. “I’m okay,” I reply. And sometimes, when it’s just me and the meandering skunks on the streets, and it’s a bright night, I like to sing to myself. I sing and I feel free. Then I try it in a place with the scent of humans, and I understand that I’m a failure. But I’m used to being a failure, now. 45 Liv emailed me script for her play. The two characters in it were her different personalities. It was so open, so traumatic. It was so horrible. It was so human. It was so Liv. It was so beautiful. 46 Jonny, the guy I had found playing my guitar at HCC, lived with his parents. Their house was a cozy place, a happy home. He kept recordings of his music on his 4-track recorder. Mostly his emphasis was on tones, effects, and getting the right sound. It was crazy stuff. I had just recorded my Fractured and Digital EP and thought it was nice to find someone who could appreciate such challenging sounds. He was mostly familiar with analog recording work, but one day he requested that I act as “producer” by using my computer to do work on one of his tracks. I said sure, and using just a wave editor I pieced together some bits that he had pre-recorded. I was exhausted by the time we finished. 47 One day at HCC, Liv was talking with a charming guy named Mick. He seemed to make her smile. He invited us along to a speaking event that Kevin Smith was doing at UMASS. We stopped at his place first. He showed off pictures from the band he had played in. We watched a video of the MTV series The State, smoked cigarettes and killed time. There was a big crowd for Kevin Smith. He showed a full-length episode of the Clerks animated series, then said, “See why the network hates it?” Mick and some of his friends, as we loitered afterward, were gossiping, using polyamorous terminology. Thanks to the Internet, I knew about polyamory, but hearing people say things like “She’s so a secondary and doesn’t even know it”, etc. , kind of shocked me. I mentioned this to Liv later, but she only laughed and said, “Ah, he’s just a boy who likes to have fun. ” 48 Before long, Liv and Mick were spending more time together. I don’t think she and I were involved anymore. I wasn’t a jealous person. There was never any clearly delineated ending to things between the two of us. 49 Somewhere in that time frame, though, Sarah H. also started hanging out near me and Liv when we would be smoking our cigarettes outside on the HCC campus. “I think that Sarah girl has a crush on me,” Liv said. One night, she invited us to drive up into the hill towns with her. She told us creepy stories. Liv said that she wasn’t scared of the spirits of these stupid towns. Later she told us that she had strange markings on her skin for a week afterward, something she blamed on her disrespect. 50 V. called me one night. She was sounding frantic. She said that she really had to establish that she and I were now separate and living our own lives. I didn’t understand what was going on. She said that things were going really well with her boyfriend, but it was too much for her to try to work things out with him when everything was still up in the air with me? So she thought that really, we should try our best to forget about each other. 51 One day in March or April of the year 2000, I was hanging out with Liv and her friend Patrick from Longmeadow. Patrick was a local musician I was starting to see around in various places, a handsome guy. The three of us were seated in the big Friendly’s on Sumner Ave. When we had been sitting there for a while without being able to place our order, I convinced them that the other Friendly’s would be a better place to eat. I didn’t explain why. When we got there, Marie was sitting at her usual table. Patrick was captivated by her. They exchanged contact info. Soon, they were dating. 52 Dave Russo, someone I knew from the HCC Drama Club, was going to be playing a show at a place called Gabby’s in Westfield. So was Marie and Maurice’s band, The Basement. They were playing the same bill! How convenient, and what a fun coincidence. Patrick was out of town at the time, so he had given me written greetings to hand to Marie. 53 I was doing bake sales for the HCC French Club, to raise funds for a trip to Quebec. I worked alongside Brielle, the woman who had been trying to make study dates with me. I had exchanged a few emails with her by this point. One day, after we were finished with the day’s bake sale, Brielle invited me out to eat. She took me to the Haymarket Café in Northampton, where, against my protests, she ordered something I didn’t recognize. I could only bring myself to nibble on it, and she was offended. She said that I should maybe consider getting psychological help for the matter. 54 Kevin Barry Crowley wrote a one-act play, Booth. It took place in a restaurant called The Queen Bee (in reference to the song “Susan’s House” by the Eels, a band he and I were both into). All the scenes took place in the same booth, served by the same waitress. I was cast as Neil, who is in the first of three scenes. He sits alone until a woman he doesn’t recognize sits down, plays with his head, then reminds him: “You raped me. ” The police come and take him way. I remember rehearsing the scene with Kevin, Diane G. , and the other actor, Courtney, at Courtney’s apartment in Chicopee. Lots of smoke was around the kitchen table. We were drinking alcohol. It was fun. Marie also helped me to practice my lines in her favorite booth at the “Little Sumner” Friendly’s Ice Cream. We ate mozzarella sticks that the waitress, whom she knew, let us have. 55 Also that semester, there was my first experience playing songs for an audience. I only had a few songs written, by then, but Dave Russo and Kevin Barry Crowley had gotten the okay to use C-111, the acting studio, for one night to put on a show. There was a bit of an Open Mic before their acts, and, though at first I had thought myself not yet ready, I went up and played two songs, “Crossing the Line” and an early, fast, squeaky-voiced version of “So Frolic the Immortals”. Later in the semester, I would play another two-song set when somebody else set up a similar show in the same room. 56 Someone had brought a tape recorder to the cast party for that semester’s one-acts. Its presence seemed to provoke the more comedy-oriented folks into hamming it up even more than usual, singing improvised songs and asking partygoers silly mock interview questions. I watched this crowd carefully. Just as I had felt a certain fondness for class clowns as a student in the Chicopee Public Schools, I liked being around these funny people, too, even if I could never keep up with them. The tape recorder was handed off to me midway through the party, just after the singalong of Weezer songs. I turned this into a CD that I burned and copied from the tape, since I was letting anyone who wanted to listen to the recordings. "

    "body": "57 Despite her worries about my culinary neuroses, Brielle invited me over for another night. This time we went to her apartment. It was clean. She fixed some vegetarian chili for us. (She was a vegetarian. So was I, at the time. ) Our drink was sparkling apple cider. We ate and chatted, then took out our books so that we could study. I said something witty to her, and she got up from her chair, walking over to mine. “Would you be offended if I said that I love you?” Sitting on my lap. “Uh, well, no, I wouldn’t. Thank you. ” Just as that happened, John, the ex she was still living with, opened the door, saw us, and slammed the door shut again. She tried to get us back to studying, but I was shaking. Maybe we should go for a walk? Yeah. Yeah, let’s go for a walk. We walked from her apartment complex and looked at the moon and talked. We reached a pond where there were ducks. I was excited that there were ducks. At the side of the road, I placed myself into the relaxed state that I choose when I want for creatures to know that I’m safe to approach. Come here, ducky ducky. As I was doing that, Brielle wrapped her arms around me. Our faces touched and we kissed, kissed for a while, standing there on the road, where maybe one car drove by every twenty minutes. We kept walking. We debated who had initiated the kiss. We lay in the wet grass and caressed each other. 58 After that day’s French class, Brielle and I parted ways. I hung around in the green room, as I often did. Diane G. and Anna E. , who were also just hanging around, decided to take a drive to the beach that night. I was invited along. Diane didn’t know how to get to the beach, so she just drove east. We ended up in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by intimidating forest. We were tired. Diane turned the car around so that we could go back to Agawam. We crashed at her place. In the morning, while Anna read a book, I stood around stocking-footed for what must have been a couple of hours, arranging a poem out of magnets on the fridge: let a rigid heaven’s disdain imagine as smoke surreal my soft life from glorious marriage spring did chisel our lovelier mess art will only capture anatomy in raw form as chevrolet fathered metaphor impression composes their dust until every sun moon smile sublime silhouette shimmering in music or through sculpture has guaranteed revile: our beautiful absurd juvenile lampoon picture me, the delicate move from her bright flings of mad white harmony loyalty don’t need no angel crying twilight has reconciled the voodoo whisper i crave the neo-bourgeousie beer she kissed me in firey red pentameter to dazzle the young appetite hurray my vain psychadelic masterpiece canvas painted deep nothing through everything pain at death unites a spirit forever no scream could compare a birth dream his girl created almost never bring roses and pray. adieu 59 I remember one day when we left HCC and needed to go over French vocabulary. We went to the Amherst common and sat on the grass and studied and kissed. A lot of our time spent together involved studying; this felt sort of nice, but also sort of dull. 60 I went to a Nine Inch Nails concert in Hartford. This was during the tour for The Fragile. I went with Liv and Mick and Rose and some other people. (Rose knew Tingley, Laurel, et al. The defining moment in our acquaintance was the time she insisted that, instead of finding some place to deposit three soda bottles, I should wait until I could find a redemption center for the sake of getting fifteen cents. We mock-argued about this for about a half hour. That conversation became a running joke, which persisted for years. ) A Perfect Circle opened the show; their first album wasn’t out yet, but people were into it because they knew it involved Maynard James Keenan. Mick found us after the show had finished and displayed a little yellow pass he had somehow obtained: “You guys can go without me, because I’ll be backstage!” He said that he would find some way to get back to Massachusetts on his own, and indeed he did. I was supposed to spend that night with Brielle, but the person who was driving refused to return me to Chicopee. She was too tired, she said. I called Brielle from someone’s cell phone. She took the news poorly. Rose and I were staying over at Liv’s that night. Eating popcorn around the kitchen table, I found myself talking about Brielle. Since the phone conversation earlier in the night had taken place inside a crowded car, everyone had heard my conversation. “With her I feel that I’m growing into more of an adult, but what I miss is that I’m no longer…” “You’re no longer Levi,” finished Rose. The three of us crammed together in bed. Liv was mumbling to herself, as if speaking an incantation. Finally she said, “I had plans for his evening, but maybe it’s best that I didn’t do what I was planning to do tonight with Mick. ” She eventually left to sleep elsewhere. I curled myself into a ball, intentionally leaving space between me and Rose, and fell asleep. 61 A grinning M&amp;M figurine dangled from the zipper of Brielle’s overstuffed bookbag, which in turn dangled off her shoulders. She darted ahead. “Hello,” I said, catching up to her. We had spoken earlier, but only for a few minutes before her class. “Hello. ” We stood in silence for a moment. Then: “Do you know how much, when we were standing out here before, I just wanted you to kiss me, and to tell me that everything was all right?” I gave her a concerned look, but didn’t answer. “I slept on the floor in Kate’s dorm room last night. I was so sure that things were over between us. What do you want, Levi?” “I want to be happy. ” “And what makes you happy? You spent the night with your ex-girlfriend, now what am I supposed to think?” “I don’t suppose anything. ” An onrush of students made its way around us. “Do you want to go outside?” “Yes,” she muttered, moving toward the staircase. 62 I was no good at knowing what to say to make her feel better. 63 My and Brielle’s conversations were often very general, speculative, and emphasized our shared beliefs. We said, like, that most people miss the important things in life, or that they don’t stop to appreciate things. I picked up certain melodic ways of pronouncing words from her. She brought wine over once in awhile, sleeping at my place as often as not. 64 I was nervous the next day Brielle invited me to come to her place. What if John came home again? She insisted that it was okay. In the bathroom I examined her bottle of expensive moisturizing shampoo. The world of salon-bought shampoos, organic body washes and body moisturizers was so foreign to me that I thought it all seemed very decadent. 65 There was a lot of Hamlet going on those days, due to it being the play’s 400th anniversary. While we at Holyoke Community College prepared our version, the local Serious Play! Ensemble (for young actors) did their own. Sheryl always liked to bring movement-based methods into her work: I had taken her classes at HCC and had followed her adapted version of the methods of Tadashi Suzuki. She liked for her actors to carry each other, run back and forth, take poses, slow walk, and so on. Aspects of the actors’ personal lives were melded into their re-interpretations of Shakespeare’s characters: for example, the fact that the actors playing Hamlet and Gertrude were Hispanic was worked into the play itself, and Hamlet and Horatio shared a kiss. New dialogue was mixed with Shakespeare’s. 66 For the HCC production of Hamlet I was cast in a somewhat surprisingly important role—that of Hamlet’s friend, Horatio. Hamlet was played by Kevin Barry Crowley. Julie McNiven, who played Ophelia, was another capable and responsible actor with serious aspirations. Rehearsals were mostly about the blocking and technical issues, such as how we would be working the giant wall that would move forward under strobe lights, then back to reveal all of each scene’s characters standing in dramatic poses. The production could fairly be characterized as gothic/industrial in its aesthetic. The soundtrack was almost entirely Nine Inch Nails songs, except for the opening number, which was David Bowie’s “Aladdin Sane”. King Claudius was dressed as a biker. The Gravediggers (“Clowns”) were combined into one character, a literal clown (played by Tingley). Hamlet and Horatio were both draped in black. I wore a beautiful worn-out leather jacket, which Tingley had kindly loaned me. Rosencrantz was played by my now-good-buddy Jonny. Dave Russo, having a busy schedule at the time, auditioned for and received a smaller part, one of the guards in the first scene of the first act. 67 My mother was looking into getting a new house. This place was a duplex in the Aldenville area of Chicopee. Brielle and I would be able to share the upstairs apartment, I was told, while Mom and Bruce would live downstairs. We went to check it out. It had two bedrooms. Two sets of stairs—one to the downstairs porch, one directly to the outside. 68 One night, Brielle was at my house. I was distant. I didn’t exactly have a reason why I felt that way. We had gone for coffee earlier in the day and I had become antsy. Meanwhile, she had been happy doing schoolwork? I had wanted to get moving. My mind had started panicking. She was older, she had lived, she had reason to appreciate the simpler things in life. But what about me? I wasn’t even used to staying in a single area of the country for longer than a few months at a time. There in my bedroom, she called me on it. I resisted sharing what was in my head. I told her that it wasn’t a big deal, it was really nothing. She insisted that I should be able to share my feelings. I attempted to explain. I must have told her that I wasn’t feeling the same excitement from being around her. This and that. My mind chose not to remember the details of how this conversation went. I remember I wasn’t saying that I wanted for us to break up, but regardless, I wouldn’t really… give her anything, that night. I wasn’t saying anything to make her feel better. She left. I don’t know what I did then. Maybe I started writing immediately. Some time elapsed. Then, she was back. It was late. I remember opening the door for her. Was she wet? It was a dark night. I think it was rainy. Tears. Yes, tears. She said, “I was driving, and crying. And I closed my eyes, half hoping that I would veer into oncoming traffic. But I didn’t. I couldn’t go back to the apartment. I couldn’t let John see me like this. He would get way too much vindication out of that. ” We slept, both on the bed, but apart. In the morning, she got up. As she was about to leave, I called out, groggily, “Brielle?” but she didn’t respond. 69 The next day, I called Patrick and told him what had happened. He immediately said, “I’ll be over in twenty minutes. We’ll get coffee. ” He was very nice to me. 70 The trip to Quebec City was the end goal of the fund-raising bake sales during which Brielle and I had come to know each other. Everyone in the French Club met up at the college campus early in the morning. Several of us had coffees in our hands. Brielle and I half-looked at each other. I think I was trying to behave nonchalantly. At some point over the course of the long drive north, she and I started to talk again. The issue was quite unavoidable: she and I had previously arranged to share a room. We all exchanged our currency early on, maybe even before we crossed the Canadian border. To take a break from the monotony of such a long drive, we stopped at a mall, I think in Sherbrooke. Arriving in Quebec City, we found the little bed and breakfast at which we were to stay. Brielle and I were led to examine the two rooms from which we could choose. One was upstairs, separated from all others. In it were two beds and no windows. The other was downstairs, near the other rooms. In it was one bed and a window. I said that we should choose the upstairs room, the one with separate beds. Brielle wanted the downstairs room. She got her way. The woman who ran the bed and breakfast asked us something in French I didn’t understand. Madame said, “I was just telling her that the two of you are married. She was wondering, since you’re going to be sharing a room. ” The woman asked something we didn’t understand. Madame translated: “She’s asking where the wedding rings are. ” Eventually, we escaped that particular conversation. The whole group of us set out to find a place to eat. Everybody wanted to go to Le Cochon Dingue, the sign for which featured a big pig with an apple in its mouth? But, looking at the menu, Brielle and I didn’t want to eat there. We were vegetarians. We suggested that we should divide the money: Madame could hold onto a certain amount for group expenses and then the spending money would be divided equally among everyone. Madame was furious. She said that we all should eat together. She called us juvenile. She was talking down to us. It was mostly Brielle and I against the will of the others. Finally, we got some of our cash. Brielle and I went to a nice restaurant. We ate tomato and broccoli pizza with wine. While we dined, we talked about the matters between us. The talk wasn’t very specific, but it seemed to clear up the issues around the night when I had acted so distant and uncaring. Brielle expressed her frustration with Madame, even though Madame seemed to think very highly of her. Madame had taken her aside earlier in the day and said that she should watch out for me, that I might be abusive and that she didn’t need a man to have worth. The whole group of us did a lot of walking, the next day, down into the old part of the city. I purchased several books that were in French. We went to the riverfront. I remembered this place from trips that I had taken, as a child, with my father. It seemed odd in the year 2000 to see cannons lined up, on display and celebrated. We all ended up inside a bar. Brielle and I grabbed stools while the others sat at a table. We ordered a bottle of wine to split, but soon the others said they didn’t find anything on the menu, so they wanted to go somewhere else. Brielle and I had to gulp down our bottle of wine as quickly as we could, then. We weren’t the only ones drinking: the others had bought a round of drinks before deciding to leave. It was funny to see Madame getting tipsy. We went across the street to a crêperie. We passed by a French language punk band that was playing outside. There was morning. There was sun. Thoughtless closeness, together in a van. I believe that neither Brielle nor I wanted to, but the group overall liked the idea of going to Montreal for that last day of our trip. I don’t remember much from Montreal. 71 The way home was quiet. When we were back in the States, back in Massachusetts, at the HCC campus, she drove me back home. Along that quiet ride, I knew that things could go either way. One of us would have to say something, make the move. It was my turn, really, but I didn’t make that move. She left and we ended, basically, because I didn’t know what to say, although I’m pretty sure I would barely have had to say anything. "

    "body": "72 Marie, who always worked retail jobs, was being flown to Sweden for training to start work at a new H&amp;M store. The chain was beginning to expand into the United States, and she had been hired at the location at the Holyoke Mall. Patrick was sad that she was out of town. 73 V. was thinking about moving to Massachusetts. 74 I had never seen someone play cello in public—only ever onstage—until one day in Northampton, in Pulaski Park, when I saw a gal my age practicing by herself. I wanted to stop and watch, and I sort of did for a minute… but I could see that she wasn’t busking, didn’t have a hat out for donations, didn’t have a sign or anything. And I didn’t want to disturb her, although I wanted to know her. So, I kept walking through to the parking lot. 75 My mother, Bruce, and I all moved into the new house. I had the two bedroom apartment upstairs all to myself, now that I was no longer seeing Brielle. The room with the bed (a new queen-sized canopy) was my Intimacy Room. I hung up framed prints of artwork. The decorations were sparse. In another room were my computer, musical instruments, records and all that. I called that one the Chaos Room. 76 I began writing a lot of songs for voice and guitar. I recorded live takes of them, using the microphone that had come with my computer. 77 One night, through people in the Drama Club, I was invited to a party at a little house in the woods of Belchertown. It was going well enough. I was sitting on the living room floor and chatting vaguely with strangers when Sarah N. —the cellist I had seen in Pulaski Park—walked in. I didn’t make any particular effort to approach her. After I had struck up conversation, though, I never left her side. Other folks were doing their things. Drinking. I don’t remember whether or not I was drinking too. Certainly I didn’t drink much, if at all. Carla was on the bed with some other people who were falling asleep, or ready to fall asleep. Then, crash! A broken window? Someone shot through the living room window? Okay, it was with a BB gun. It must have been the kids of the damn hick neighbors. After that scare, the party resumed. At the end of the night, Sarah N. asked me for my AOL screen name. 78 I had long telephone conversations with Sarah N. , usually at night. She read me letters that ex-boyfriends had written to her. We shared our poetry with each other. Of course she wrote: it seemed like everyone I met wrote, back then. And everyone’s poetry had a unique flavor. 79 Jonny would drive me to Northampton. We would go to Haymarket, get coffee, then leave. Eventually, he wouldn’t even call anymore before coming for a visit. I would know that it was him when I heard his big boots on the outside stairs. He always sprinted, taking two or three steps at a time. 80 And, oh, then again, V. was definitely coming out here, but instead of coming here to move she was just coming for a visit. After further consideration, she knew that didn’t want to leave behind her friends by moving here. She still belonged in California, she said. 81 I finally arranged to hang out again with Sarah N. in person. We met at the Fire &amp; Water Vegetarian Café/Performance Space in Northampton, then walked around the town. She around the campus of Smith College. It was night in the summertime. We were in a little field with fireflies. Look at all these fireflies! I had never seen fireflies before. How did things like fireflies stay hidden from me? I would need to tell V. just how beautiful the fireflies were, now that I knew. We had to lie there for awhile. It was just too amazing, on that summer night, in the tall grasses. Then we walked around the pond. It was all new to me at the time. So there we were, lying down and talking a little bit. We cuddled up some, but as much as she seemed to give signals that she wanted to be close to me, she still kept her face in the opposite direction from mine. 82 I am in fact quite tired. I had planned to let myself drift to sleep around 11:00 last night, until that plan was thrown off by the arrival of Marie and Patrick. Marie had called earlier to ask if she could spend the night—in the middle of a fight with her mother—but so much time had passed, I had assumed that plans had changed. My venture with them to the International House of Pancakes (IHOP) for the purpose of coffee consumption was quite enjoyable. There was something very nice about having them around, in the crazy little world of my apartment, for a night. 83 The first kiss Sarah N. and I shared took place on my loveseat, while the “first kiss” scented candle from the dollar store at the mall burned down next to us. 84 A private investigator has been lurking outside of my home. It probably has nothing to do with me and will never affect me in any way. 85 “Sarah? Will you be my girlfriend?” I asked. I said it in a silly voice.  She smiled and answered yes. 86 We sat down on the town common, kissed and held hands and talked. 87 Is my arm uncomfortable for her? Might my head rest just a little closer to the sound of her heartbeat? How much of our bare legs can touch from this position? It’s almost as if I’ve never slept next to someone else before. But then, everything else has seemed that way with Sarah, too. I shouldn’t be shocked by the strangeness. 88 Dear Sarah: So, it’s morning, and again I find that I’ve awoken beside you. I feel like last night was definitely the oddest of those we’ve shared thus far. I was feeling very weighed down by my own thoughts, and I know you were feeling under the weather yourself. Sharing a bed with you has brought out for me the only real occasions I’ve had to question how well we can complement each other in a long term (as opposed to momentary or fleeting) sense. It’s not that sharing this sort of thing intimidates me or discomforts me, but rather that when I see, feel, sense you next to me in the middle of the night I simply want to be absorbed into all there is that I see in you. The pull towards a coming-together, towards finding complete solace in holding you next to me, overtakes me. And I know that’s not what we are. I think we energize each other while still maintaining our individual natures and individual goals—and really, that’s something I need at this point in my life. I suppose half-consciousness is just a state of weakness for me, and I’m sorry if my rolling over and embracing you at 3 AM gets in the way and annoys you. It can frustrate me at times that I won’t completely understand what you find appropriate in little things like this. From what I know of you thus far, we have similar desires—but until I feel like I understand, and know for certain, where you stand, that awkwardness will remain at times. Essentially, that’s why I always gravitate towards sitting and talking before going to a movie or something. There are so many things I feel like we should be working out, but I don’t know how or even what these things are all the time. My “fun” times of letting loose and enjoying life without all the deepness and such have been pretty limited this summer. Theater helped me a lot during the school year, because I felt accomplishment and excitement while enjoying the company of others. I wish I found it easier to let you share that side of my life, but circumstances just haven’t allowed that yet. In closing, I want to say that you should feel comfortable with letting me know what things I do make you unsatisfied. Whatever happens, you make my life a lot brighter with everything you do and show. I just don’t want anything to compromise the respect and goodness of us. Life is too beautiful to be weighed down by uncertainties and awkwardness. I’m working to move past that. And I hope you’ll be there with me. Love always, Levi. 89 It feels like this lifetime is a final hurrah, an orgasm of pent-up wishes and extremes of character. If I have been home to self-contained excesses of widely-differing traits over the courses of past lives, this time around houses them all, and uses them together to expel the knowledge and emotions I no longer have a need for. “You can have all this passion which has lingered inside of me,” I say, “For I have no need of it anymore. ” Part of me still wishes for a child… but I worry that I might have abandoned my only chance for that in lieu of what I now claim. What I feel is a strong emptiness in areas that once screamed madly of endless potential. We all know all we need to know about the future. The universe will be a beautiful particle. Our souls will be kind. We will rest. 90 We walked from my house to the flagpole at the Aldenville Commons.  We sat there. “Do you know one thing that I like about you?” Sarah said, “Unlike most of the people I know, you don’t smoke. ” “Well,” I said, “I used to smoke. I still do, sometimes. Just not as regularly, anymore. ” Really, I had decided to try to quit for her. I never smoked around her. I tried not to smoke at all, although really the best that I had been able to accomplish was not smoking for a couple days, then having a few cigarettes each day for the next few days, then not smoking for a couple more days. 91 She lived with her father in a house in Florence, Massachusetts. My first time going over there, I looked through the compact discs in their living room while she was upstairs changing for something. She had the first Papas Fritas album. She also had Ani Difranco’s Living in Clip. 92 At her house. It was during the day. The sun was out. We were in her room. (There was stuff all around. Lots of papers and books. Very exciting. ) We were on the floor. (She had a deep closet. ) (Pictures of people. Some of them looked familiar, I had seen them around. It was special to see them and to hear stories about them. ) She and I were kissing on the floor for a time. Then her father called from downstairs and said that her ex-boyfriend was there. Lying upstairs still, I could overhear their conversation, I think, as she told him that she had company. She came back upstairs and said that jeez, he didn’t even call or anything? That was creepy. It was the same guy who would sometimes try to get her attention at her bedroom window. Wasn’t that creepy? I answered that, well, if you’ve made it clear to him that he should call first or whatever… Ut-oh, I was saying something wrong. She asked me if I was upset. I said that no, of course not! She hadn’t known that he was going to come over, so why would I be upset? No, but was I mad at the ex? Well, for coming over? I don’t know, I said. If he thought that it was appropriate, then whatever. He hadn’t known that I would be there. Her brain was processing something that I didn’t understand. She said that most of her friends would agree it was kind of weird I wasn’t upset at all by that. Didn’t I feel a little jealous? He was an ex-boyfriend, after all! I said that, well, I think it speaks highly of someone for them to be friends with ex-lovers. She was like, huh, that still seems a little weird. I, meanwhile, was like, well, I’ve just always thought of jealousy as more of a bad thing than a good thing… 93 Then there was the day when we decided to go to Rhode Island to find a beach. We didn’t have directions to any specific place, but we would figure it out. We left early in the morning, got there, drove around a small ocean-side town until we finally found some beach space. It wasn’t particularly pretty. We took off our shoes. People were digging for clams nearby. That was so weird! People were actually digging for clams! Non-ironically! 94 I told her about V. coming to visit. She said that that was really weird. Coincidentally, she was scheduled to leave for Maine for a trip just a few days after V. arrived. "

    "body": "95 I had to get my Aunt Kim to drive me to Bradley International Airport. V. and I hugged and said, “Wow,” at seeing each other, because that was the appropriate thing to say. V. looked skeptical about being in Massachusetts. As we rode in the car to my place, her expression was clearly saying something along the lines of, At the time I thought it was a good idea to buy the plane ticket, but… I’m really not sure why I’m here anymore. So it was definitely odd walking up the steps to my apartment with her, that first day. Getting inside and realizing, We have to figure out what to do with all of our time, now. It may have been the first day. It may have been the day after she arrived. It may have been a little later. Whenever it was, it was near the beginning of her visit. We were going to see Northampton. I don’t remember whether this was her idea or mine. The weather was hot. We walked from my place down the street to the bus stop that’s next to the Aldenville Credit Union. We must have been talking about us, about our epic history. “So,” I asked, “Do you still think we’ll get married someday?” She spoke. She liked to look down when she spoke about delicate matters. She said that she couldn’t deny our connection, and, I think, there was more: the way that our lives did sometimes seem so parallel and how we had been through so much. But, she knew that her home was on the west coast and that I was out here with my own life. And sometimes, she forgot about it, or tried to forget about it—about us— but still, then, it always came back to her, (I think these are the things that she said. ) So, yes, she still did think it could be. She still had hope. At some point in the future. After we had both lived some more, and could be in a position where we lived in the same city, and were stable. She added, “I don’t expect that it could happen for awhile. Maybe when we’re around twenty-five. ” “Twenty-five! Six years from now!” I couldn’t imagine. Six years from now! But still, it was an added validation to what I already figured. I was viewing our eventual happiness as an inevitability. Fate. I thought we just needed to sort through all this life-stuff. Work out our respective problems. Build our ‘real world’ personae. Like, we needed to figure out our lives before we could trust our lives with our love. 96 V. and I took buses to Northampton. When we arrived it was still early in the morning. The center of town was empty except for one stranger, who walked in the direction opposite to ours in the crosswalk. So it happened that the first person she and I encountered in Northampton said to us: “I’m sorry, I just had to say this. When I saw the two of you, I just thought to myself, ‘Those two look perfect together. ’ Like, if they took a thousand people and matched them all into couples, they would start with the two of you. ” 97 We found Bart’s Ice Cream, which was one of the few places already open. We sat there for a while, then, as the number of people in the town center began gradually to increase. A number of people (tending to be males) approached to speak with V. She had that sort of magnetism. I, of course, was of such a temperament that I only sat and watched the exchange. Many cigarettes were handed out to strangers as we sat at our table in front of the café. 98 Although our first time together in Northampton started off well, by the end of the day I was falling into something like a depression, and this feeling didn’t really let up at all in the days that followed. My apartment had been cleaned for V. ’s arrival, but it didn’t stay clean for long. She started trying to be out of the apartment as often as possible. Via the Internet, I believe, she befriended a local guy named Ted and started hanging out with him. They were hanging out with Liv, too. Ugh, I thought, They’re talking about me! Thrown in there somewhere were points when V. and I did spend time together. The weather was hot, and she rarely wore a shirt around the house. On more than one occasion, we slept together in underwear and she asked, “What is cheating?” meaning, was this really okay just because we weren’t kissing? Sarah N. came over maybe twice before she left to Maine. When this happened, V. became uncomfortable, retreated to the Chaos room and found someone who would pick her up and get her out of the house. I was busy being depressed. 99 I was employed by Saturday Matinee: The Movie Store. It was in the Holyoke Mall. I was a part-time sales associate. The job was okay. My employment kept me at an even further distance from everything that was going on with V. This visit wasn’t going very well for her. But, if only she could have been moving out here, to stay with me! As it should have been, should! Have! Been! Because then, I wouldn’t have been trying so hard to keep hold on a life that could last through her visit! I would have let everything fall apart if it could have meant that she and I would be together. But I wasn’t willing to compromise… whatever… just for the bittersweet taste of… what? Renting her from her real lover, then giving her back? 100 There was definitely one night when Patrick, Jonny, V. , Sarah N. , Liv and I all sat around and talked. Liv overwhelmed the conversation and made everyone laugh. 101 V. wrote a song on my guitar. As far as I know, it may have been the only song she ever wrote with a guitar. It went, in part: “When you learned that you would someday have to die/You made the choice to never see the sunrise”. I couldn’t remember having ever watched a sunrise. Maybe it had to do with my environment—too many trees, and buildings, and hills. Mostly, though, I was sure it just had to do with my failing to notice when it happened. I recorded her performing this song, using my computer. 102 When V. and I finally parted, after (how did it pass so quickly?) a month. At the airport. Liv was the driver for this venture. V. had to rush to catch her plane. As Liv pulled into my driveway, I was sleep-deprived. I cried on her about my feelings around V. I was so spacey and so far gone that I was inadvertently speaking in what sounded like a British accent. We laughed and went upstairs and fell asleep on my bed. The sunlight peeked through the shades. 103 After school one day, I felt crazy. I didn’t want to go to work. I remember calling in, that day. That was scary. I was so scared that I would lose my job. Why didn’t I know how to function in the workplace? No one had ever taught me how to be a successful worker! Someone should have been telling me how to keep a regular sleep schedule. How long had it been since I had known such a thing? How could I smile while following orders? If I were so smart, why couldn’t anyone teach me these things? 104 I had spent much time, at night, working on my script for Memory of a Nightmare. I really wanted to write and direct a one-act play. I figured that I might never again have the opportunity to do such a thing. The play was a concept that had been kicking around my head for about five years. The original story had dealt with a child and his imaginary friend. Those characters remained, but the new script also covered the adolescence this child would live. He spoke to a therapist about his past, then entered into the scenes he discussed. At the end of the play, all the characters came out to pointedly tell him everything he had done wrong. He was saved by his imaginary friend: the entire play had been, not a dream, but a flash of recognition about the future which, as a child, this character understood was the life he was fated to live out. I submitted my script, leaving a copy in the green room for everyone to look at. It was accepted for inclusion in the one-acts, although it was quite lengthy for a one-act. 105 ROBERT walks onstage, into a spotlight, stops, and stands. ROBERT: If thoughts could resonate over the ether of our progression. Perhaps, then, the troubles of times future could prepare us for the trauma of times present. What have we to prepare ourselves with but the past, the times whose lessons so often mislead rather than assist us in that struggle for happiness that occupies us all? I wonder what I might see within the eyes of myself as a young boy. To look upon my own face, yet unphased by the numbing nature of growth and its accompanying blindness. To see my young admiration for society at large diminishing with each of my parents’ angered breaths. What would I tell my younger self? And if I might have spoken to him from where I stand now. What could he have learned? And what could have been averted? 106 I gave Sarah N. a copy of the script for my play when we went to Cape Cod for my cousin Jennifer’s wedding. Sarah and I had our own hotel room. Before she could get far into her reading of the play, we began to have a serious talk. Since returning from Maine she had barely been affectionate toward me, was barely responding to my questions. She had been growing more and more distant. She said, “I wish that I could just… go away for a few months. To gather my head together. Then, I could come back and I could be with you again and everything would be okay. ” But that wasn’t going to happen. Talking. Talking. We seemed to be at a stalemate. She didn’t know why she was feeling so distant. I fell into the practical, rational mode that I could get into, sometimes, while making serious decisions of emotional impact. This trait of mine was scary. I could see its scariness in the eyes of people. When I made a difficult decision, I explained it so coldly. Only my words were demonstrative of my feelings on the matter. My body just relaxed; my vocalization became emotionless. I told her that we couldn’t be together if we couldn’t see each other, talk to each other, and share affection. Our status as being together would have just become a label, a make-believe, in that case. So we broke up. She went back to reading my play. Halfway through it she started crying, locking herself into the hotel room’s bathroom with it. She didn’t exit for awhile. She asked me whether the play was autobiographical. I said that it wasn’t. Like most people, she didn’t believe me about that. 107 SARAH: How was the party? (Robert winces) Oh, no! What happened? ROBERT: Everyone had some sort of crisis going on, as per usual. A lot of drama. SARAH: I really wanted to go. Was it that bad? (Robert nods; Sarah sighs) Aargh! Not you! You can’t be depressed too! I think there’s something in the air today. Everyone I’ve talked to is so depressed about something or other. ROBERT: I’m not depressed. I don’t get depressed. SARAH: No? ROBERT: Not really. SARAH: You sound it. You look like you’re depressed. Did something happen at the party? ROBERT: Right now I’m just lacking motivation. It’ll pass. SARAH: Oh. Yeah, I know how that is. That’s sad. ROBERT: But not depressing. SARAH: (Pause) A lack of motivation. I think that’s my problem, too. Life is starting to get so crazy. ROBERT: Just starting to get crazy? I kind of wish I could be there again. It seems like my life’s been one big mess of chaos for as long as I can remember. SARAH: Like, my boss, I don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to put up with her. I went in there today, and she got on my back as soon as I walked in the door- “When you closed last night you didn’t leave the information where you should’ve left it and you didn’t vacuum in the back” and on and on and on. I mean, if I do something wrong I can understand that. But she’s just so mean about it, I can’t stand it. ROBERT: I just haven’t been reaching my quota of interesting stimuli to keep me inspired. SARAH: Well, that’s the same thing. All I do is try to stay sane while I’m working this job, and I can barely concentrate on anything else anymore. I don’t know what to do. ROBERT: But you at least understand what you want to do. SARAH: I do, but I don’t know if I can do it. Or if I should do it. I want to, but at the same time I don’t want to. ROBERT: But what parts of you want to or don’t want to? SARAH: I might want to quit my job and run off and do something crazy right now, but that might not be the best thing later on. I don’t want to end up regretting what I do now later on in life. ROBERT: Ah, short term versus long term gratification. Yeah, that’s tricky. SARAH: I don’t understand people. It seems like everything should be so simple, but some people are just so mean. ROBERT: You should know what you’re doing it all for. If you don’t know for sure, then you’re as good doing one thing as doing anything else. And in that case you might as well just experiment. SARAH: Yeah, right. That’s so easy for you to say. See, that’s why it’s so weird to hear you saying that you’re uninspired. You can always find your motivation. You don’t sink into routines like I do, and like a lot of people do. I see you somewhere and I expect to hear you say you’re plotting out the next great American novel or something. ROBERT: (Amused) The next great American novel. SARAH: Something like that! You’re so creative. I’ve always wanted to be like that, but I think I just let myself fall into situations where I can’t. ROBERT: Nothing can stop you from doing anything that you want to do, though. Only you can stop that. SARAH: Maybe. "

    "body": "108 I cast my play. The experience was surreal. I sat in a chair, and watching as people put their best into reading the dialogue that I had written. It was awesome. My play was going to be one of two plays on the same program. The other was Pinny, a slapstick comedy about the trials and tribulations of a walking piñata. I was glad to learn that my play would be first on the bill: Pinny would have been a tough act to follow, indeed. Candy was literally hurled at the audience throughout that play. 109 Went to work today. At Saturday Matinée: The Movie Store, inside the Holyoke Mall. Minimum wage employment, but better than food service. Worked with Dawn, who painted my nails a nice silvery color. 110 Around this time I went back to Haven. This may originally have been at Liv’s provocation. I was astonished by the number of familiar faces I saw on the dance floor there, dressed in uncharacteristic black garb. These were people I knew in various ways. Many of them had gone to HCC. I danced most often to songs that were familiar to me: Concrete Blonde, Tori Amos, The Cure. One night, as I twirled around the dance floor, a woman began to dance near me. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to jump to the conclusion that she was trying to insinuate anything. I didn’t avoid her, but I didn’t make a particular effort to dance with her, either. Once I was off the dance floor, she talked to me. She said that she had liked the way that I danced. This was Moon. She laughed loudly. We spoke outside on the porch for awhile. We exchanged our contact information. She introduced me to her boyfriend, Colin. Theirs was an open relationship. She was also seeing Lydia, whom I had heard of and seen at this club before. 111 The next week at Haven she introduced me to another friend of hers, who went by the name of Greg. Greg was extremely high-energy. Apparently, he had heard things about me. The two of us were sitting outside and smoking when suddenly he gave me an unexpected peck on the lips. “I stole a kiss. Do you want it back?” I was surprised to find that this upset me. I wished he would have asked me for a kiss, or given me some warning that he was coming in for one, or something. In response, I gave him possibly the sloppiest, most haphazard tongue kiss that I have ever given in my life. This made sense to me at the time, somehow. 112 I wish people would at least ask me before they started calling me their boyfriend. I never even liked that term. To Moon, I’m also “number three”. To Greg, I don’t know what I am. 113 “With all your sexual experience, I’m surprised you’ve never heard of this,” said Greg. “I want to go home now,” I said several times. “No,” he said. 114 And Moon visiting in my apartment: there we were. It was winter. She entered always with a big smile. She didn’t get sad over little things, but when circumstances were rough she talked away her frustration. She smoked clove cigarettes. She would often get so into her stories that I didn’t know how to keep up conversationally. 115 I remember one time when Moon came over unexpectedly and woke me up. It was 7 o’clock at night. She had brought Lydia, who it turned out giggled and curtseyed just as much outside of goth clubs as she did inside them. She also brought Kestrel, whom I hadn’t met before; he wore black clothing, spikes and chains. I was insecure about having new people over when my apartment was such a mess, but once my grogginess passed and we had made the venture to Bickford’s, I was having a good time. I had brought my black paper-journal with me, because I never left home without it. Moon wrote something into it. (Among journal-writers, it went like this: you passed your journal around to your friends, and you told everyone to write something on a page of it. You even let friends read the thoughts that you had been writing into it. Why? Because they were your friends, and you could trust your friends. ) 116 Moon helped me when I needed to practice lines for Memory of a Nightmare. She and I also worked on songs together. 117 Diane dissected the different manifestations of me today, and there was vibrant happy Levi, cute five-year-old Levi, grumpy five-year-old Levi, overtired Levi, and I asked which Levi I was then and she said “Social Levi”. But I don’t believe that they’re all Levis. 118 Leah Ryan, the HCC graduate turned successful playwright, offered to read my play. “You should trust your audience more,” she advised me before her workshop. “You could stand to lose some of the exposition. Let the audience reach their own conclusions. ” 119 I told very few people before I left to Chicago. The day-long bus ride seemed like nothing to me, at this point. Chicago’s was one of my favorite bus terminals: it was small, crowded, and uncomfortable. After arriving there I sat at a table and wrote into my journal while I waited for Socks to arrive. Two people within my age range—one male, one female—were sitting at the table next to mine. The female commented to me that liked she my coat. This was Jacqui, an Internet-addicted Smashing Pumpkins fan like myself. I gave her one of my scrap pieces of paper, which I had used to ‘map’ certain metaphors and symbols from my play. Jacqui and I agreed to keep in touch by way of the Internet. She lived in California. So, when Socks showed up to meet me, I was already conversing jovially with these strangers. Socks had driven down from Minneapolis. I had given her, without cost, a concert ticket, which Jonny had originally agreed to buy from me but then had changed his mind about. She wanted to show me her favorite vegetarian restaurant in this city. She was vegan and an animal rights activist. Even when she spoke excitedly, she was quiet. But she was nice. It was unexpected to be meeting her so many years after we first talked online. 120 Jacqui was waiting outside the venue. She was among a frantic crowd. Fans showed off for television cameras. The Smashing Pumpkins were playing two farewell shows. Tonight’s was the first, the larger of the two. The very final show was scheduled for a few nights later.  I wasn’t going to be able to see that one, sadly. The crowd was made up of many fans from across the continent. I excitedly struck up conversation with strangers. People stood next to ashtrays with cups of beer. During the show, I cried. I cheered. I convinced myself that this symbolized the end of an era for me. Our seats were far from the stage, but at least our view was unobstructed. They played “Starla” and an acoustic version of “Muzzle”. Those were the best. 121 In the morning I took an eastbound bus. At the Cleveland terminal I noticed a large circle of other kids who were wearing Smashing Pumpkins tee shirts. They laughed and looked friendly. I talked to them. We sat in a group on the bus. We played a game through the night in which one person told of three things about themselves and the others needed to guess which statement wasn’t true. I fooled them all every time. The bus parked at a rest stop in upstate New York. The driver had been driving illegally because he had forgotten some sort of identification back in Cleveland. We needed to wait for the next bus to come through before we would be able to continue our trip. Our group of Smashing Pumpkins fans ate at Denny’s. After dining we all wandered through the long, strange hallways of this rest stop. We had a picture of us taken in a photo booth. The booth printed out little stickers. We chose for ours to be captioned with one of the machine’s poorly translated options: “We have married”. We played with bouncy balls from the vending machines. It was a fun time. 122 People in the Theater department at HCC were angry after they learned about the trip that I had taken a week before my play’s opening night. One cast member yelled at me. I looked down at my feet like a child who was being scolded. “Grow up! Stop being five!” she yelled at me. At a Drama Club meeting, Pat, the Acting professor, expressed her disdain for what I’d done by saying, “If there’s someone in here who thinks they should offer an apology to their cast, that person should do so now. ” I kept my head down. I said nothing, but scribbled “Faith?” onto a piece of scrap paper. Another one of my cast members, noticed and added, “You gotta have…” to the beginning and “!” to the end of it. Some people were forgiving of me, but I still had apparently ruined whatever reputation I may have had. Discussions began about whether or not the show should go on. I listened to Tori Amos’s Under the Pink in headphones through the fog, then decided that the show must go on. My lines were 3/4 of the play and I knew them fully well. The actors had all gotten to know their characters, and I was proud of the work that they had been doing. And anyway, I had intentionally scheduled excessively long days before and after my trip to Chicago to make sure that the actual amount of rehearsal we got to do wasn’t affected. 123 In the end, the performances by the actors were all great, but I gradually came to see that the script had been over-ambitious and self-indulgent. In fact, the following semester, my play and I were parodied in another student-written one-act. 124 Still overwhelmed by Christmas season retail work, I remember coming home and finding multiple messages on my machine from Greg: “Where are you!” It made me feel uncomfortable. I didn’t call him back. 125 And more generally it felt like my social life, which had been expanding for the past however many months, was getting shaken up. 126 Ethan was among the crowd who hung out at the picnic tables in the center of the HCC campus. He approached me to enthuse about how much he’d enjoyed my play. He spoke grandiosely. He had childlike eyes, recited quotations in German, and loved Henry Miller. We exchanged numbers. Soon, we hung out regularly. He convinced his friend Justin to hang with us sometimes. I was told that they had chosen me to join their artistic revolution. Justin’s focus was music; Ethan’s focus was writing. I both wrote and made music. I was seen as a worthy collaborator in their movement, which would express the unique passion and circumstance of our generation. 127 Then I was introduced to an online diary-hosting/social networking service called LiveJournal.

    "body": "1 Charlie: “We have to go to New York City sometime. ” Levi: “Okay. want to go now? Actually, we’d have to wait until the local buses start running in the morning. ” Charlie: “Yeah? Could we?” Mick: “We could drive right now. Let me get my boots on. ” He stands up and turns off Velvet Goldmine. 2 The signs says, “DRAW BRIDGE”, so I’m drawing a bridge. We’re on a quest to get to Brooklyn before the engine overheats. 3 “Mick, what the fuck are you doing here?” “It’s a long story. I’m assuming that you’re naked. ” “Jesus, how many people did you bring to my apartment?” “There are three of us. ” “Where are my pants?” “Hi, I’m Charlie. ” “Yeah, we’ve met. You were at the party. ” “Right. I was the shiny red ass in the pictures from it. ” “Oh, yes, that was you. Hi, Levi. What time is it?” “About 8:30 in the morning. ” “What?! Jesus, I have to work this afternoon! I just fell asleep!” 4 “We’re going to have a Risk and chili-athon. We’re going to get really stoned and have a chili-eating contest. The minimum is going to be one pound of chili, and if they don’t eat that they get beaten. We’re going to beat them. ” Mick and Luis catch up on past times a bit, digressing into talks about Ozzy Osborne, the difficulty of obtaining particular drugs, how much of a shithead Giuliani is, and Space Ghost Coast to Coast. I lie back and flip through a magazine. 5 We have a lovely brunch. It’s expensive but fulfilling. Charlie calls his boyfriend on Mick’s cell phone. “Thanks for breaking up with me over the fucking phone,” I hear him say. Then he asks if he’s going to Haven tomorrow night. A bird flies by. Birds, peck peck peck. “I’ve been broken up with before,” says Luis in condolence. That’s something he has to offer her that I don’t: I’ve never really been broken up with. 6 Mick’s aunt’s living space overlooks Central Park. We enter and sit for awhile, lying that Charlie and I are presently college students, enjoying coffee and almond treats served by a… what is the word, even? A maidservant? “I feel like I should squat in an alleyway after living that fancy life for a bit,” I say, “Just to counteract it. To feel the yang. ” Mick’s aunt also mentioned that she previously lived in Portland, Oregon. “Portland is a wonderful city,” she said. She told me that I need to go there sometime. 7 We go back to Luis’s place, although he’s at work. Mick wants to nap before driving home. He falls asleep; so does Charlie. 8 Charlie wanted to look into this journal. In fact, he began to look into it, but I told him not to. This isn’t normal for me. 9 Sarah N. and I had a 34-minute conversation, although it felt like it was much shorter than that. “I wanted to talk to you partially because I want to know what’s up with Jonny,” she said. “He’s been acting really strangely. ” She said she had changed her mind about going on the trip with him. 10 I see Jonny at the club. The first thing I say to him is, “Jonny! Hi! I don’t hate you!” I talk to him for a bit and give him a hug. The night goes by as I run, jump, hug, chit-chat. I dance some. It feels good, because I haven’t danced in awhile. Kestrel tries to kick me in the unmentionables when I make a move to steal his stuffed friend of the night. I go to the diner across the street, telling Charlie to head over there when everyone is ready. It’s not long before he shows up with Nelson and Kim. Nelson gets out at his place and grabs a bottle of tequila to take to Mick’s. Mick decided to have an after hours get-together for people who don’t feel like going home after Haven. People are drinking. After experimenting with music software on one of the computers I take off and go to the Denny’s in Holyoke. I’m only there for a little bit before everyone else who came from the club takes off. I bring my computer into the bedroom and record music by candlelight. 11 Charlie connects me with Tina, a LiveJournal friend of his who lives in the Boston area. “I’ve never identified with someone so well in a first conversation,” Tina says when we chat using AIM. 12 I lift the shade, see the day, and decide that my twenty minute nap was enough of a rest. I catch a bus and go to Holyoke Community College. It’s time for another visit to the folks at my old stomping grounds. 13 Grass! Grass! I’m sitting in grass! The snow has melted and I can the feel the grass again! Soon I’ll be able to play in parks! Wheeee! 14 “Did you hear, they’re putting computer chips in animals so that you’ll know which pet is yours if it runs away. I suppose pretty soon we’ll be having the same in buses, too. ” (Overheard, the driver speaking to a passenger. ) 15 In Northampton, walking to buy cigarettes, I see a face, very stern, firm, seeing me, and I realize that it’s Madame, my old French professor. “Hello,” I say. “Hi,” she says in return. Later, I exit Fire &amp; Water for a cigarette break. I make the move to the covered area outside of Thorne’s marketplace, seeking shelter from the rain. There I see Jenny. I haven’t run into her for about a year now. Her hair is now strawberry blond instead of black. We make small talk while she waits for her ride. “It seems like everyone has plans to move on this summer,” she says. “Yeah, you’d think we’d have done all of that when 2000 came. ” I say. “Nah, too much hype. ” “Plus we’re just lazy. ” “Now we’re having all sorts of earthquakes and floods all around and we start to think maybe we should be doing something with ourselves. ” “We’re having earthquakes and floods? I heard about Washington state. ” “Yeah, there’ve been lots of little ones since and stuff. ” 16 After I wake up from a much-needed nap in the chair at Fire &amp; Water, one of the employees tells me that Charlie called, said he was in Northampton and left a number where I could reach him. I don’t have change for a phone call. My guess is that he’s still at Mick’s. After tearing Conor away from Fire &amp; Water, I drive to Mick’s. His roommate answers the door and says that Charlie already left. Then she adds, “Oh, I know. He’s at Nelson’s. ” I drive down the road where Nelson lives, although I’m pretty certain that I won’t remember the exact house. I’m following a car whose stickers I think I recognize as having been parked outside of Mick’s the night before. But the rain is pouring heavily, I’m disoriented and being tailgated, so I can’t see where it is that they’re pulling into. I give up on tracking down Charlie, figure that I’ll leave him to his own devices. I’m not happy when it registers in my brain that in order to drop off Conor I will need to drive through the ever-increasing rain and winds on Interstate 91 through Springfield. Indeed, once I’m in that area it’s like a nightmare, as I’m surrounded by aggressive, speeding tractor-trailers. One of these monstrosities (of the three surrounding me) decides that it would be a good idea to pass me just as my lane is about to end. To avoid being crushed into the guardrail I’m forced to come to a near stop. After I’ve dropped off Conor, another truck speeds up when I try to move into its lane. It’s as through the driver is trying to kill me—but I still survive! 17 My vision is poor. I never see people; I just see smudges of color. But it would be too much trouble to wear contacts. They bother me. And glasses get fogged up and smudged… so I only wear them when I’m driving. 18 I will be 20 years old a month from today. Barely over a quarter of a man’s life expectancy. But can I really imagine living what I’ve known as life, three more times? Weird. 19 I went to grab my traditional medium cup of regular coffee from Nancy’s before starting my shift and noticed that they had put up a “HELP WANTED” sign. I mentioned that I had already put in an application a few months before. I was told to fill out another one. The girl who had recognized me the night before said cheerfully, “You want to work with me!” and told her co-workers that I was her friend from school. If nothing else, that explains to me where I should but don’t remember her from. 20 Sitting at The Grotto. Two “G”s drawn in black marker, one on each hand. Sitting by myself. Writing in a journal. Smoking a cigarette, ashing into an ashtray. My matches and cigarettes are on the table. So is a small cup of the complimentary water. Kilean comes over and talks to me for awhile. He talks about his cat and his unemployment. Then he goes to talk to DJ Todd. I’m looking at the table next to mine. I count seven beer bottles, three glasses and one cup. I’ve been told that those who are under 21 are not allowed to leave and then come back. I would like some coffee. I’m not sure why I’m here. I have no idea what day of the week it is. No, wait… I’m straining my brain now… it’s Saturday. I work tomorrow at noon. I should have had some coffee before coming inside. I’m such a caffeine fiend. 21 I drove, went vroom vroom. I liked the idea of something simple, like picking up Annie and wandering around somewhere. So we went to Greenfield—to Rooney’s, the store owned and operated by my aunt and uncle. Arcade games were being brought in. The entire downstairs was redone, colored light panels in the ceiling, newly-designed walls, lights lights lights. The first thing that my Aunt Brenda did was to have Annie and I follow her out to the back to pull down the top of Chris’s convertible, since it was raining. (I didn’t have friends before grade school. It wasn’t an absence, though, because I didn’t understand that I was missing anything. I just had a few cousins my own age and saw them when they were around. ) After the financial troubles the clothing store has been having for years now, the space is being turned into a video arcade. Chris designed a little section in back as a lounge area, a psychadelic, blacklit hideout. “It looks like a ’70s basement,” said Annie. Ken kind of acts like a fashion designer. He likes to splurge on nice clothes. (Nice little coffee shop, in Greenfield. Large freak contingent in the area. Like a new Greenfield. ) After Greenfield, a moderate/light rain on the highway. I went too far south, never noticing the correct exit. Took a long way to Northampton. We saw Luis from the car. “What’s Luis doing in town?!” said Annie. We weren’t able to find him after we had parked. Window-shopping, then, she turns to go into Thorne’s. “Oh, we’re going into Thorne’s? Okay,” I say. Then I hear someone call my name. I look over, and it’s a girl I had talked to for a bit after the ball drop on New Year’s. We hug, talk for a couple minutes, then Annie and I go inside. We get some ticket info about upcoming shows. I grab a flyer for The Vagina Monologues and say that I’m going to grab a cup of coffee from Fire &amp; Water. Maurice is there with Kim. They had just come in from Cambridge, Mass. I asked him about The Basement, his band with Marie. He said, “Well, word on the street is that there’s a future for The Basement. ” “Yes, but have you experienced this yourself?” He said that he wasn’t sure if the drummer was still interested. He also wasn’t sure that he remembered the drummer’s name correctly. “He’s a friend of Marie’s,” he said, “And it’s been awhile since we’ve all played. ” Kim suggested that he and Marie play the open stage on Monday. “Wait a minute,” I said, “I have tentative plans to hang out with Marie on Monday. So, maybe we could integrate these ideas, and you guys could play here, and…” I stumble trying to explain myself, but he understands what I mean. Annie and I next go to the Hampshire Mall, because I want to go to the used music store. I buy two cassettes, Milla’s The Divine Comedy and the MTV Buzz Bin collection, “Volume 1” (a flashback to the popular rock music of six years ago). We move on to Amherst. She wants to go to a toy store, but it’s closed. She asks whether I would mind going to Newbury Comics. I say that I wouldn’t. We enter. I see Marta and Dennis. I get the impression that Dennis sees me before I start talking to them, because he seems unsurprised when I do. Marta, on the other hand, doesn’t recognize me until I’ve been talking to Dennis for about a full minute. As usual, Dennis was the one doing most of the talking. He said that they had done a split CD release with a friend of theirs who was also a noise act, using four of the tracks that I had recorded with them. “Do you still have my cello?” I ask. He shakes his head, no. “But the keyboard you borrowed from us is yours now, have fun with it,” he says. The cello was worth a couple hundred dollars more than the keyboard is worth, but I know that it’s my own fault for being so good at disappearing from people’s lives. He extends the offer for me to stop by anytime. I should try and remember to. I’d like to hear how our tracks came out. Annie and I get food to go from two separate establishments. I drop her off at her place in Sunderland, go home to Chicopee for fifteen minutes to shave and brush my hair, then pick up Charlie fifteen minutes late. From there I go back to Sunderland to pick up Annie and Carl, then to Northampton to go to Cathedral, the goth night at The Grotto. Charlie can’t get in because he doesn’t have his I. D. , so I drive him down the street to Nelson’s, then head back. I lurk around, not much happens, I feel bored and am not impressed by the crowd that’s there. I tell Annie that I’m going to wait at Fire &amp; Water for her and Carl, but they think they would like to leave early as well. I wait around, I’m supposed to be their ride, some people write in my journal, I listen to Devon vent to Paul (whom I met sometime late last year through Liv, hanging out at his place with her one night). Annie says that I don’t need to give her and Carl a ride anymore, because they’re going to Mick’s afterwards. I walk with her to the car so that she can get her stuff out. “Are you feeling better?” she asks. “Better than what?” I say. “You seemed kind of down inside. ” My answer is mostly silence, plus a mumbled “No, I’m not” as we cross the street. Then I drive home and fall asleep. 22 The only response that I can ever recall having received from my father, when I was trying to be serious about my issues with him: “Oh, don’t say that. Oh, you don’t mean that. Hey! Stop saying that. You’re out of line. ” The only times when I got acknowledgment that he understood I had feelings were when he would tell me to stop feeling a certain way. Aside from his obligatory statements that he cared for me (which were never connected to anything that I did or said, and simply stood on their own, as if to say, “I love the idea of you, although I am oblivious to who you really are”) the only way to get any emotional reaction from him was to piss him off. And I can’t stand to hear raised voices. I can’t stand to feel anger. I was suffocated by that while he was still married to my mother. I believe my father is incapable of appreciating another human being. Throw this deficiency of his against a child’s natural desire to want to win their parents’ approval and what you have is a hopeless situation. A child can never be appreciated by a parent who can never appreciate. No, I don’t want him reading my journal. And I don’t want him to harass my mother like he’s been doing. He won’t reach me at that number. That number was never given to him. No one there, or here, wants to hear from him. "

    "body": "23 A customer asks, “Has anyone ever told you that you remind them of Andy Warhol? You probably get that a lot. ” I respond, “No, I don’t think anyone’s ever told me that. I have people tell me that I remind them of someone a lot, but it’s always someone different. ” She goes on to say, “I was trying to figure out who it was that you looked like. It’s definitely Andy Warhol. ” The guy she’s with supports my response by saying, “No, he looks more like Trent Reznor. ” I try to think of what celebrities I’ve been compared to—mostly Crispin Glover and some various glam rockers. At least I haven’t been offended by any of the comparisons yet. 24 I left a message on Tina’s answering machine. Also, I wish that I had more string cheese. 25 Tuesday, I arrive at work and am immediately greeted by a Russian guy in sunglasses who casually tells me that I look demonic. “Did you say… demonic?” I respond, not sure whether I heard correctly. “Yeah. Demonic. But like a famous composer or something. ” “Um, okay,” I say. Other customers show their sympathy for me by making expressions as if to say, “WTF?”, but the Russian guy goes on. “You must have no problem getting the ladies, though, huh? The girls must like you. ” I’m befuddled. “Um… some of them do?” I smile politely until he leaves. Aaron starts at 5:30. Rich leaves at 6:00. Aaron and I both started working at Electronics Boutique, as part-timers, about three months ago. I’ve been left in charge to close for the evening. Aaron, as it turns out, is incapable of understanding most of the simple tasks his job description calls for, but while he’s not busy calling me over to explain to him how to do something he enjoys commanding me to help with whatever he’s doing. Almost immediately after Rich leaves, a guy comes in with three big bags, containing his Nintendo 64 console, some accessories, and about 40 games that he wants to trade in. Immediately after I’m finished with this, someone else does the same with their Playstation. Sure, I’ve never taken a system as a trade-in before, I have limited understanding of what components are included with systems, what variations/model types are available and exactly what everything is, but I get through these transactions. The tough part is that throughout most of this time Aaron is standing around asking me questions. “Can we accept this game as a trade-in? It’s kind of scratched. ” I explain to him how to judge the condition of pre-owned games. “The receipt paper is jammed”, so I fix that, tell him to reprint the receipt. “How?” he asks. I tell him. He doesn’t understand. I do it myself. Meanwhile, I’m answering the phone and trying to get the counter cleared off while customers are waiting for me to finish helping them. I could have run the store more efficiently if he hadn’t been there at all. Did no one ever teach him how to take out and store the insides of game boxes, how to shrink-wrap and price things? The only reason the games that needed to be on the floor were out there by the end of the night was that I raced like a speed demon to accomplish everything. Then I say, “Well, I know that on an eight hour shift, by law I’m supposed to be allowed a half hour break, but I’m just going to step out for like ten minutes and then I’ll be back, so I can finish up with everything that needs to be done. ” “Why don’t you get a nicotine patch, boy?” he says. “No, you don’t understand,” I say, “I was going to have a meal today but now I’m not. ” “Whatever. You smoker!” 26 I go to Haven from work. It’s Rocky Horror night and, well, like our parents might have told us about the Vietnam War, we can now tell our children about bad gothic karaoke. Kilean takes over the reigns of DJing as a screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show occurs in a separate area of the club. Someone calls my name as she sits on a couch with several people, playful body movements and people screaming that they’re being crushed. “Hi,” I say, “Who are you? It’s dark,” is my excuse. She tells me a name. I can’t remember having ever met anyone with that name and I don’t recognize what I can make out of her face through the darkness. We still hug and talk a little before I say that I’m going to wander around. I go to watch the karaoke after the look-alike contest. I feel someone wrap their arms around me from the back, as I sit. The person is climbing onto the platform next to me. I turn my head a little and catch a glimpse of her face. She kisses me on the cheek and asks me how I’ve been and I start talking before I figure out who she is… because it doesn’t matter anymore. After the club, I take Annie and Carl to the Whately Diner, we eat, I drop them off, and I go home. 27 Waking up, chatting, Tina/Tina requesting that we talk on the phone, Charlie awakening to the sound of my conversation. Charlie, needing attention, asking questions while Tina continues to talk and I try to follow it all. This is how much of the day feels, trying to keep up, things being complicated, things being demanded of me. The night before, Charlie and I alone, had been nice. We talked, and there’s a real comfort that I find in listening to people open themselves up to me on any level. Tina, on the phone, her boyfriend Bill with her there. No, wait. Was that the second time we talked? Did I talk to Tina three times on the phone today? I can’t remember. But, yes. at whatever point, back and forth like a four-way conversation, Charlie and me and Tina and Bill. “Instead of going out somewhere, we should invite people over here,” says Charlie, so we invite Madeira to come and hang out. Jonny calls while Charlie’s gone to meet Madeira partway (since he’s walking to my place). I tell Jonny to come on over. So Jonny, Madeira, Charlie and I go to… the supermarket, for some reason. (Why? We didn’t buy anything, but we hung out in a supermarket. In retrospect, I don’t get it. ) Then we went to Madeira’s. I sat numbly watching Clerks with the commentary running along with the film, on the Independent Film Channel. Charlie today tried to go through a list of potential partners for me. It was cute. 28 “Why are you touching my neck?” Charlie asked. “Because it’s fun,” I said. “Stop. You are not my boyfriend. You are not allowed to make me squirm with pleasure. You can’t turn me on. ” “Sorry. Well, thank you for telling me. Just let me know if ever I start to turn you on again, so I can stop. ” 29 Morning: Tina, crying because of something I wrote in my LiveJournal, but she told me that I helped her through it well. It drained me before work, though, and I showed up half an hour late and scraggly, and I hadn’t managed to buy coffee because the ATMs were down. Work, standing through work, selling Tribes 2 and Playstation 2 consoles. Leaving, arriving home, listening to my messages but getting three phone calls before I can listen all the way through them, and… I say that I’ll pick up Charlie so that we can hang out, I tell Leon that I’ll head over to his place and hang out with the people who are over there, and I tell Carrie that I’ll head up there to Smith College where they’re partying. Outside of Charlie’s, once we’re in the car together he begs me to make a stop at Brenden’s. We stop there and say hello and he tries to show Brenden the “All your base” Shockwave file but his modem’s slow and it’s taking an eternity. (I had agreed to pay for Charlie to get into Haven on Tuesday, he’d gotten transportation by another means and as such had borrowed the money from his mother, but I’d forgotten to give him the seven dollars to pay his mother with, and in yelling about it his mother had said that she didn’t want my money, so Charlie said, “Since you’d been willing to pay for me before, just buy me cigarettes” and I kind of gave him a look, so he said, “Fine then, I have five dollars, just drive me to the store” and then he mentioned that he’d stolen it from his sister and said, “What’s wrong with stealing from my own sister?” and I told him that I’d quote that in LiveJournal. So I don’t stop to let him spend the stolen money like he wants to, at least not at first, and he says that he’s not going to talk to me until I buy him cigarettes, although that doesn’t hold true. ) Then we try to go to Leon’s and I’m pretty sure I’m at the right house but don’t know what entrance to take and all, so I feel bad because they’d been expecting me but we move on… and finally, in Northampton, I stop while Charlie runs into the DB Mart. We get to Smith and people have already been drinking. People are in Kim’s dorm room, Maurice is there. We go to the smoke room downstairs and I sit on Charlie’s lap and say, “Wow, I never sit on anyone’s lap! This is fun!” and as he’s trying to wait for the broken elevator to save us from the stairs everyone from upstairs comes down wanting to play pool. We walk with them, using Kim’s keys to open some door, I’m trailing behind and notice that Maurice’s not following. He’s standing at the door giggling because he can’t get the key out, a safety pin on the keychain has come undone and he keeps poking himself on it, so I get the key out of the door and proclaim myself the Keymaster. It turns out that Kim’s keys won’t get us into the pool room for some reason, then the other people find that they can’t figure a way for us to get out because the key won’t work on the other side of the locked door that we just came through, but eventually I point out an open stairwell and we head upwards. Back in Kim’s room, talk, and I had only drunk a little bit of vodka with orange juice before going downstairs and that was gone now so I made myself another cup and had that and then was attacked by Charlie insisting that I take a shot of whiskey, and Carrie handing me her drink, whatever it was, so I take the whiskey and that’s it for me. We talk for awhile in there, and Carrie asks me if I want to show up for the ball that’s the next night and I say sure and she says that there are two conditions—one, that I dress nicely, and two, that I come as her date. I agree. Kim says that she has to get sleep so all except for her and Maurice are instructed to head upstairs to Carrie’s room, but only Charlie and I show up and Carrie plays guitar for a bit and we talk and she puts on music and sings along to Billie Holiday and the like and Charlie is on the computer a bit and then leaves the room to go to the house’s living room for a bit and he makes it known that he wants to leave but even though I’m not incredibly affected by the alcohol, I don’t want to leave yet, and Carrie demands that we not leave, and while Charlie’s gone, I come back from getting Carrie a cup of water and I say, “I look so freakish when I haven’t shaved in this long” and she says, “I’ll think you’re sexy no matter what”, she’s under the influence and I put to her to bed, tucking her in, and she tells me to cuddle with her and Charlie’s there saying that I’m a notorious cuddler, then finally I say that we should be going and Charlie says his stuff is in the living room and Carrie says “Okay, so Charlie can go get his things and then you guys can take off and I’ll get to sleep” but then Charlie says “No, I’ll just wait until you’re ready” and then Carrie says something asserting that she wants to say goodbye without Charlie present, and Charlie says he’ll wait in the hallway and Carrie says to me, “Do you want to go out?” and I say, “Out where?” and she says, “You know… go out?” and I say, “I’m going to the ball with you tomorrow!” and she says, “But, you know, like, we can go on a real date and everything” and she talks about how awkward saying that to people can be and I say, “I’ve never asked anyone if they want to ‘go out’” and she says neither has she. These things, between saying “I’m so gone… I haven’t been this messed up in a long time, you know I wouldn’t be saying any of this if I weren’t so far gone” and she says, “I think we would be good together. ” Also, she’s a Leo; in Kim’s room I had said, “I have a history of falling in love with Leos, and being burned. I’m scared of Leos” and she hangs onto this statement for most of the night and says that she won’t burn me. I remain a gentleman and say that we’ll see what happens, and I tuck her in and turn off the light. Charlie says that he’d had things that she wanted to discuss, when it’d been earlier in the night, but that as we walk to the car his mind is blank and he has nothing to say. I tell him I want to hear when he can tell me, because I care, and he says he knows, and we listen to NOFX on the ride home and I drop him off and I come home, and there’s a message from Tina saying to call no matter what the hour because she wants to know that I’m not feeling bad about her feeling bad, and I want to talk but first want to type an entry, and need sleep because I know that I have another work day ahead of me. I also need to get a new tape for the answering machine. 30 In the car, mind going through metaphors like dust going through dust and I think that I don’t search for lovers or even friends so much as I look for willing participants who’ll be subjects to the zany experiments that comprise my actions, so I think of myself as a mad doctor only not working for the sake of science but for love and I smile at the conclusion that I’m “Dr. Love”, and then as I step out of the car the statement “I am cheddar cheese” pops into my head and I know it’s completely random but I think of a way for it to make sense and I come up with, “I’m so sharp, not everyone can handle the taste”. And wheee! I suddenly think that riding a roller coaster would be fun. I met Carrie at Smith College and we went to the ball that was going on, and it was very cute as she held onto my arm and we danced together and a band played Motown favorites. I apologized to her that I was inexperienced in the area of this sort of event, because I had never been to a dance before. “Not even in high school?” she asked, and I shook my head. The people we hung around were Salma, Nick and Wendy. They were good people. I danced enough that I wasn’t a party-pooper, though I was shy at times. I was more confident when I danced with her than when I danced alone, because if I’m going to dance alone I feel like I have to imagine myself completely alone, to feel the music. I hear a lot in music, and to pretend I hear nothing more than a beat seems like a lie. And we went to Salma’s dorm room and sat around and talked about tomatoes. And then Carrie and I left and we went to her room and then the bathroom where I watched her brush her teeth. My smile never wavered when she said, “I didn’t mean it when I said we’d be good together. Well, not entirely. ” And I told her not to worry about it. I always tell people not to worry about it, because when people worry about me it usually means that I have to worry about them worrying about me or I’ll hurt them because there’s no resolution to their worry because I’m so easy to worry about because in the end I’m just a tragic, smiling figure giving a kiss to the sunset.

    "body": "31 Never forget that sadness is healthier than anger, although the man who beats the wall with his fists when pushed to his limit will be given more consolation and less medication than the man who watches trees dance in the wind. 32 Almost to sleep on the phone with Tina, drifting off but in a fully conscious way. I long ago learned that I’m not the type who can make stories interesting, so I don’t tell stories when I’m in a conversation, even if I have something really interesting to tell. When I’ve tried, the stories have only fallen flat, because people think that there always needs to be a point to a story, and I don’t give a point. I just hand over a knife and this novel block of wood, and the rest of the time I listen. 33 The Basketball Hall of Fame, in Springfield, visible from the highway, is being redesigned. If that huge spherical framework is going to be made into a giant basketball, it might well be very funny-looking in the near future. I sit, talk to Marie at Friendly’s Ice Cream, but it’s non-smoking now, grr, and we talk and then I come home and see Annie online and ask if she wants to do something and she says yes and I’m going to leave and pick her up soon. I’m lending Syrma and Jessica (whom I met at the all-ages goth night) $50 so they can take their dates to prom, on the condition that they have lots of fun. 34 I stepped into the night and saw the stars. My heart was light. My jaw was clicking. My throat was dry. The air was still. I lit a cigarette, walked a few steps, looked up at the stars, raised my arms in freedom as I tend to when I look at the stars, walked a few more steps, and looked at the stars some more. I leaned against the vehicle and thought that if I looked deeply enough I could see a sky completely filled with specks of light. Within the center of my vision began to grow the sights that I see with my eyes closed—the blackness, the wall of little red circles, and peeking through this barrier the funnel that connects this universe to the one adjacent. Allow the text to bring you back to what preceded. A relaxation was felt, and relaxation is sacred, for I spend my days in a rush to find the moment of rest, not as a businessman working for his day of rest but as a prisoner appeasing his captors until they betray the secret of escape. “I wish that I could reach the stars. ” “You can. I hang out there a lot, and look down upon the people with their heads in the clouds because I’m even higher. ” I sat with Hank at the Whately Diner and we talked. He asked me why I don’t seem to seek out people who would challenge me. This has been something he has noticed in me since our early talks: after reading the chat logs I posted online he mentioned that I seemed to have put so much into my conversations even when the other party had been very passive. After this, he and I went back to his place and hid inside her room. I lay down on his bed. He cuddled up to me. I said that I wanted to stay and sleep next to him, but that I needed to have the car back soon. I napped with him for an hour before taking off. I felt a state of sensitivity as I made my way home. I threw what remained of my cigarette into the road and was startled by the image of my own shadow in the trees across the street, seen through the darkness and the haze of my unaided vision. My shadow was larger than I was. I started to drive, and I wanted to slow down out of regard for every inch that I passed. Then I ran over a bunny. That sucked. 35 I wish I remembered what I did with the paycheck I got on Friday. Carrie emailed me last night and apologized for having given me mixed messages. Charlie left a message, too. I’m going to call him now, then I’ll go to work. 36 I guess the cigarette wrap always sticks, but when I touch it and it clings to me tonight I’m surprised, and I question why, and wonder if I’m really so magnetic. “Look at the moon!” I say. “We’ve seen that moon before,” says Charlie. “No we haven’t! Look at it!” “Maybe it wasn’t with you, but with someone else recently I noticed it like that, big and yellow and low in the sky. ” In my mind I fantasize about touching the wall and sticking to it, and climbing and climbing into some sort of blackness. Someday I’ll look back and find it remarkable that I lived these days, just like so many other of my past lives. Charlie: “I’ll get out to give you a hug goodbye, Annie. ” “I was actually going to get out to see you off, too,” I say, “Because I didn’t want to be outdone by Charlie. ” Charlie makes a sound to acknowledge my statement. I turn to him and say, “Because you know I always have to compete with you. ” A while ago, buying props for Memory of a Nightmare, at the register of A. C. Moore Crafts, the cashier told me she’d seen me in Hamlet and as it turned out she’d been the person who’d thrown up during one of the performances. I figured we would meet again, and that happened tonight at the club. She was more weirded out than I was by learning that we knew several of the same people and had been to several of the same concerts. This was Jill. I didn’t get any contact info from her. We’re bound to see each other around again, anyway. Crow told me that she and Tingley had broken up again. I asked her how she was doing. She said, “Okay, and you?” I said, “Well, I’ve been okay. But I haven’t been going through a breakup. ” She misunderstood what I’d said, and confused a lot of people by telling them that I had just broken up with somebody. Kilean showed off a couple of Club Metro shot glasses he’d gotten. The people at the table next to us at the Whately Diner asked if they could use one, poured some vodka from a water bottle into it, and offered it to us. Charlie downed what he was given. 37 A bright, beautiful, hot day. Driving, seeing the beauty of the landscape that’s been obscured by bad weather and bad moods. Going alone to see The Vagina Monologues. (I didn’t realize that pop culture had caught The Vagina Monologues on its radar until I told my mother what I was going to see and she instantly knew what I was talking about. ) While exiting, running into Delphine for a moment—she’s there with her mother, which I think is neat. A calm, pretty, comfortable night. Going to Fire &amp; Water, where Charlie and Conor wait. Charlie seems really unwell when I first see him. “Are you okay?” I asked. “Yeah, I’m fine. ” I look at him. “No, you’re not. ” “Yes, I’m fine. ” Then, the way that he looks around for distraction. Kim: “You seem very meek tonight. ” She does an imitation of how I’m carrying myself, and it’s funny. James, who I knew at HCC, is there. As always when he talks now, he’s about three inches from me while his face is pointed elsewhere. He used to be quite a charmer, but today, when I ask him what he’s been up to, his flatly-spoken answer is that he has been masturbating. It isn’t charming. Stopping in Harrell’s for ice cream. It’s me, Charlie, Hank, Conor. Charlie talking about himself while Hank is kind of giving advice and I’m holding Charlie’s hand. Kissing Hank in the car while Charlie ran into Harold’s to give him back his jacket and whatever else. Hank said to me, “I’m glad I was wrong about us not being able to be friends. ” “Why did you think that?” He said he thought I’d shown a lack of interest at some point. (Don’t mind Levi, he has a lot to organize and he can be timid about moving things around. ) Dropping him off, then. Stopping at the Whately Diner because I want a cigarette, but of course we go in and get sucked in and I end up having to pay for food that Conor ordered even though I hadn’t agreed to pay for him. James and Adam G. and Nelson and other folks show up. I stay entertained by entering detached celebrity mode around Conor—speaking cryptically, cool and collected while he jumps at everything I say in compulsive postulation. Dropping off Conor and sitting outside, turning off the ignition and talking to Charlie. (Abbreviated snippet of conversation) “You made out with Hank!” “Yes. ” “Hank’s your friend!” “Right. ” “Well, is there, like, more to it than that? Do you like him as a friend or do you like him in a sexy way?” “Well, he’s a good friend, and we’ve been comfortable with kissing and cuddling. ” “But, there’s kissing and cuddling because you’re friends and you can do that, but then there’s just being attracted to someone. You and I kiss on the lips and that’s cool because we’re friends, but it’s not that I want more or want to date you. ” “Well, Hank and I have been friends for a couple months now. What’s your reasoning when you’ll get to that point with someone you’ve only known maybe a couple days?” “Well, that’s different, because that’s just, like, that’s being driven by a particular emotion, and that’s horniness. It’s seeing someone and being attracted to them, but with friends it’s different. ” And later he adds, “With you, like, when I got involved with Alex, it was like, I knew that if I were ever to be together with you, or date you, it would have to be really good and really stable, because I didn’t want to lose you as a friend. ” 38 Work. One customer in the store. He’s “just looking, thanks. ” Rich is on break. I’ve been playing with a balloon, rolling it around my arms with the aid of static. The customer leaves, and I am alone with the Game Doctor Disc Repair System demonstration videocassette. It’s a beautiful day! I wish I were playing in a park somewhere. Near the beginning of my shift a customer returned his Playstation 2 console to exchange it for another under our extended service agreement. I gave him the opportunity to stomp his old one to death, which he embraced gleefully. Charlie called to tell me that he now has a job at a doughnut shop. He also chewed me out for not giving him transportation to and from the interview as I had offered to do. I have green tea with lots of sugar today. Yummy! Okay, time to play with the balloon some more. 39 I made some children happy by giving them Pokémon posters. I gave out a balloon, too. Syrma came in with Rose, neither of them realizing that I knew the other. I gave Syrma the $50 that I had promised. Aaron, with whom I’m working tonight, was like, “What?! Why are you giving her money?!” “Because I’m nice,” I replied. “When do you want to take your fifteen minutes?” I ask Aaron. “In a little while,” he replies, “Probably around 8:00. I have to run to the bank, though. ” “Well, go for it. ” “I’m not going to take my fifteen yet, though. ” I shrug, and say, “I don’t care. As long as you spend a little bit of time in the store. And as long as you don’t yell at me when I want to step out for a cigarette. ” “I won’t yell at you! But, c’mon! Don’t you want some nicotine patches? The tobacco companies are making money off killing you! You realize that, right? Wouldn’t you like some nicotine patches?” “Wouldn’t you like a rubber band in the eye?” I say, aiming. “I’m gonna go now,” he says. 40 Coming home from an eight and a half hour long shift, and I’m sort of tired to start off with and I sign on and just as this happens Tina is online and she tells me that she just finished speaking with Bill, and to start off she’s distracting herself while she still can, relaying things, her talk with Bill that ended with him saying, “Do you want monogamy?”, her saying, “No. ” His response being the click of a phone hanging up. To me she says, “Please don’t feel like this is your fault. I know you’re not the type who would, but please. ” I relate to her feelings so much and care and understand and my mind is reeling with how much her situation says to me, even in how it makes me think about my own ways and feelings. (But I never feel guilty for provoking it all. ) And then Bill is calling again so I get off the phone with her and I know that Charlie wants me to call him, both Mick and Madeira tell me so, and he had told me to do so, he’d called me at work, but I want to be there for Tina, but finally as Tina is still on the phone I call Charlie and he tells me that he’s sitting alone going mad and he needs to see me, makes me promise to be there in a half hour. I agree, sign back on, Tina tells me she needs to call, and the next conversation with Bill that ended with his saying, “I’m breaking up with you. I love you. Goodbye. ” She says to me, “Why the accelerated breathing? You’re not the one who should be upset. What are you feeling? It’s hard for me to understand sometimes. ” And I respond, “I’m sorry, I’m busy empathizing. I’m busy feeling for you. ” I have to leave to meet Charlie’s time limit, and I show up and he’s on the phone with Tina. I talk to Tina some from there. She says that Bill keeps calling back but she doesn’t want to talk. She says that she’s been in this situation before, and she feels strangely free and doesn’t want to give in, doesn’t want to let him come back when she knows that he still won’t be able to deal with how she feels, and her need to explore. Charlie wants to get out of the house. I feel it as soon as I walk in, that we need to leave, and we waste little time. We drop off videos for his mother at Blockbuster and stand outside smoking cigarettes. I’m crazed at this point, as I’ve been since speaking with Tina through it all. Crazed, as in, making small inaudible laughs at everything, speaking without thought. We go to Mick’s with the intent to grab some things Charlie had left there. Tina is on the phone with Mick. I talk with Tina. Sometimes the talk is weighty, sometimes not. Meanwhile, my ear overhears Charlie and Mick as their discussion gets… tense. Then Mick gets on the phone with Tina and is as vibrant and joke-cracking as ever. He tells Tina what bands she needs to check out. Charlie shakes his head at him as he talks. We leave. We buy cigarettes at a gas station in Holyoke. We smoke outside. A guy comes near to us and slinks against the wall of the building. He asks if we need change. We say no. Charlie says, “I wish people would offer me drugs like they offer me change. ” “You want drugs?” the guy says, “What kind of drugs?” “Just marijuana. ” “Ohh, marijuana. ” “Yeah. No crack-cocaine, sorry. ” “Aw. yeah, I don’t have any marijuana. ” We prepare to leave, and he asks for a ride down the street. I apologetically say no. He leaves with a silent friend who has exited the store midway through the conversation. I pull up into my driveway. “Why are we here?” asks Charlie apprehensively. “Because I drove here,” I respond. He has things at my place. “Just come up and grab your stuff,” I tell him. We talk, and sit on the couch. He asks if we can go to the cemetery to visit his twin sister’s grave. I say yes. As we’re standing to leave, the phone rings. It’s Tina. Most of her words are indecipherable through the sobbing. “I’ve been talking to Bill and he just keeps saying these things…” “I love you! Love! Love! Love!” I say, and everything that has been surrounding me is imbuing me with such passion that nothing I say is veiled and every word is intense. I refer to myself using the pronoun “we”, just as I refer to her. “We’re going to be okay. ” I hear Charlie in the next room, singing. As soon as I feel that I’ve helped Tina somewhat, I tell her that Charlie and I really need to go somewhere. I don’t tell her where. Charlie scribbles a poem. I stare at my cigarette as it burns. It burns so quickly on its own, the ash at the end grows, I just stare until he’s finished. Driving to the cemetery. “Do you ever hear songs on the radio and think that what songs come on at a particular moment hold significance? Like, real significance?” “All the time. It happens around you a lot. ” “I used to always think that there was meaning behind things like that, back when I ended up in the hospital. It’s bad. ” And at the grave: “We would always bring a flower. ” “Do you want to get one now?” “Well, at Stop &amp; Shop we could get one. But, do you want to spend the money?” “Yes. ” “You’d like to?” “I’d like to. ” At Stop &amp; Shop we see Veronica, whom both of us know from going to school in Chicopee, working the overnight shift. “We bought a flower to bring to Sarah’s grave,” says Charlie. “Ah. Nice,” she says. She prices a box of canned goods like a jackhammer, slams the pricing gun down on her cart, and quickly unloads the box onto the shelf, before starting with the next box. Charlie, holding the flower, in the dark cemetery, reaches the headstone as I stand several feet behind. A crow loudly takes flight from a tree above us. “Random bird,” he says, and laughs, “As I’m standing around looking for a sign. ” He sings. In the car in front of his house he says, “I was almost ready to say I wanted to check myself into the hospital. When we were at your house. Not because I think I’m crazy again, but just to be somewhere and be able to talk to someone and to let them poke my brain. ” He enters his house, three hours before the start of his first day of training at the doughnut shop. And I drive home. "

    "body": "41 At least this pen works, I think to myself after finding my way to the coziest spot that I can find—that is, kneeling upon the dirty ice on an area of road which once was plowed. I sank past my knee in snow on the journey. No, there’s not supposed to be any more snow on the ground—at least, not any more than a few scattered patches where large piles once rested. However, this morning I am somewhere in the mountains, somewhere in Massachusetts. I’m not sure where, exactly. I’ve been thinking about Tina all night. I’ve been thinking a lot about her since she entered my life, of course, but only now do I feel free to begin to express precisely how. Only here in these mountains, which scare me with their intense energies. I planned on taking her number with me, when Leon picked me up. I wanted to call her between 11 and midnight, she’d told me she really wanted to talk to me after she got out of work. But I didn’t: I forgot. Leon had with him four high school girls. We went first to a park. I was so happy, on the swings, feeling the breeze against my face, and it made sense how in grade school I swang for so many entire recess periods, without talking to any of the other children, without ever feeling the need to. From there we went to Leon’s, and I asked to use the computer. Tina wasn’t signed on. I briefly managed to skim over her latest journal entry. It seemed positive. I was distracted by everyone around me, and agreed that we all should head out, destination unknown. To the edge of the Chicopee River, getting three life stories. One of the girls saying to me, “Wow, I’m thinking about your life story, and I really have had a boring life compared to you. ” “Well, still, how old are you?” “Sixteen. ” “See, nothing really exciting had happened to me yet when I was sixteen. So you can start now!” I start giving advice about running away to adventure before realizing that telling these things to someone still in high school is probably not a good idea. The Chicopee Denny’s is too crowded to seat us, but I share a cigarette break with Madeira, who is there with Isaac and some others. To the Denny’s in Enfield, Connecticut. Playing what Leon calls “The Levi Game”, he has begun to play it with people, my game of speaking a word, around which another tells a story from their life. I say that we should go to Vermont simply because we were in the state south of Massachusetts already, so it would be funny to also go to the state north of it, too. We stop at a supermarket to pee. Leon pushes me in a shopping cart. Four of us dozing off on each other in the backseat, until the going gets so rough that we awaken to Leon speeding down a narrow icy road plowed between huge snow banks. I wonder what the hell’s going on. We’re going to a campsite, usually vacant during the winter months, to a camper belonging to a relative of Leon. There’s no road leading directly to the site, so we walk on top of amazingly high snows—I casually pat the top of a street sign—to get to the camper. Everyone except Leon squeezes together on the bed. One of the girls to another, “Hey, your second day starting to hang out with me again, and already you’re sleeping in a bed with boys. ” “Not boys, a boy. ” “Still, your Mom would think it was a sin or something. ” “I’m a sin?” I say. I can’t sleep. After everyone else has drifted off I sneak out, grab a beer from the fridge and write alone on paper towels. I’m a wasteful, chain-smoking child who has fine-tuned romance to an art form all its own. (My life is one big marathon lap, a quick one, triumphant as my ligaments tear and I don’t care. ) With all the things I run from, I don’t wish to run from my heart. I always feel so presumptuous when I first let people into my life, feeling that I understand—feeling, not thinking—the explanations. Any of my good friends know my weaknesses when they see me in action, but the crazy thing about what I’ve become is that I really am a wonderful person. (People are waking up already, and using the potty. ) 42 Audrey calls from her car cell phone. We babble for a few minutes, then her car seems to be doing strange things and funny lights are turning on, so we end the conversation. I drive to Northampton to see the play that Carrie invited me to, but don’t know the Smith campus well and don’t find the place where it’s being held. On the way back to the car I see a couple talking to each other. They stop walking. They stand, hold each other, and then kiss. “Yes! Love is the answer!” I exclaim as I walk away. They smile. I go to the Whately Diner. No one on the staff can lend me a pen, so I have a quick cup of coffee and leave. I am without money until next Friday. I drive to Mick’s place and through the window see someone I don’t recognize talking to someone else who is unseen. It would make sense for me to go in and see who’s there, especially since Charlie has left messages for me saying to get in touch tonight, and I figure that he’s probably inside. I’m too timid to knock on the door and find out, though, so I go home. As it later turns out, he is indeed there and needing a ride back in this direction so that he can work the next morning. I tell him that I’m willing to go back up there and pick him up if he can scrounge together some gas money. As I wait to hear back from Charlie, I hear thunder and heavy rain outside. 43 I walk in the rain a little, just for the sake of being rained on. After a long wait, Charlie gets back to me. Some scandalous events had distracted him from telling me that he no longer needed a ride home. Madeira tells me over IM that he suddenly remembered having seen my old online personal ad and thinking that if he were into guys he’d check me out. Charlie IMs me again, says some things that don’t make sense and are very typo-filled, and says he’ll call me as soon as I sign off. I sign off, wait ten minutes, come back online, ask him what happened and he signs off. By now Leon has agreed to pick me up and rescue me from boredom. 44 Leon, Keisha, David C. and I arrive at the Chicopee Denny’s to find that they’re closing, so we go to the Holyoke Denny’s. The décor makes it look like it’s 1982 in there. 45 Audrey IMs me. She tells me that she wants to move to Oklahoma this summer. She says, “I think perhaps I’ve waited too long. To care, to be cared for by you. And that sucks. ” I try and convince her to stop being so harsh to herself. I know how hard it is, but I wish for her happiness. I ask her to come and see me again sometime. I work on compiling my chat logs. In the midst of this process, Tina calls me. We talk for about four hours, asking each other questions and talking about whatever comes up. It feels good. 46 In a car with my mother. I showed her around Northampton, which she’d never really explored before. Now we ride north. Massachusetts can actually be really pretty. If things had gone differently, I would be in my final semester of college right now. 47 The countdown to Tina is at four days. Here I am, perched upon an outside bench now, in my vision sensing the stray strands of my hair, the broken leaves absorbing into the soil, the trees, the painted mural on the building’s side. The stylized youths, the hopeful birds savoring their sparse but consistent subsistence. Look, and know what it means to be outside on a Spring day. Look, and know the comfort of being alone with the understanding of your place in it all. Love, because no matter how self-destructive you may have once been you are alive to see the show and to understand that the old lose their grip and the young seek the security of a job well done and a hand to hold. Aspire to know all. Aspire to be nothing. The questions of sexuality, the futility of riches. The dilapidation of high technology. The illusion of individuality. The boredom of superficiality. The disappointment of the open mind. The apathy of the elderly. The implosion of the working man. The drowning of the youth. The haziness of the attainable. The nonexistence of the enemy. The distance of the friend. The dispersion of the lover. We who have survived the dissonance of this generation rise from our cluttered corners of compulsion and count the clouds, targeting the sky through kaleidoscopic wisdom. 48 Turners Falls Pizza. Turners Falls, Massachusetts. With my mother. She tells me that my cousin Ken is moving somewhere far out west to assist in the beginnings of a new Yankee Candle shop. “That’ll make him happy,” I say, “He’s been trying to get out of the area. ” “Yup,” she says, “And Chris is doing what he wants to do,” referring to the arcade. “And I’m doing what I want!” I say, grinning and sprawling out limply over the seat of the booth. “I never get to do what I want,” she says. “Well, after I’m out of here this summer you’ll be able to. ” “Yeah, right. ” “Well, taking into consideration the commitments you’ve gotten yourself into. ” “You’re still not going to tell me where you’re going?” “I’ll let you know when I’m more positive. I don’t want to jinx myself. ” “All that matters to me is that you have somewhere safe to stay and that you have food. ” “I always have. ” “Uh. Well, in California? I still don’t know anything that went on out there. There was the ambulance bill I had to pay for. ” “You paid for that? I thought I threw away the bill. ” “I think I did. Or maybe I sent it to the insurance. ” “So, uh, how about this weather we’re having, huh?” 49 I wake up in the night. I feel like getting out, as I usually do. I drive to Fire &amp; Water, though I know that the open stage has finished. The band Hospital is playing. I’m content, watching them and drinking coffee. Charlie comes in from whatever adventure he’d been on. I step out in the rain and walk, run, jump around. It’s raining. It’s beautiful. I love it. I tell Charlie that I’m up for anything he wants to do after. He says he wants to stop at Mick’s. We do, and after Mick is finished playing Starcraft we talk for a bit. Charlie and I want to go to Whately for coffee. Mick says that he’d like to go as well. At one point in the night, I randomly exclaim, quoting a TV marketing slogan for dog treats, “Iiiiiit’s bacon!” and Mick tells me that he had never realized I was human before. Mick and I talk a little about Liv. “She talked about you a lot,” he says. “Yeah? Complaining about me?” “At the beginning she did a lot, yeah. It was blah blah, Levi this, Levi Levi. ” I come home to a message on my answering machine from a crying Tina, telling me to call her as soon as I get home because she really needs to talk to me. Tina is upset because she read in my journal that I plan to move away this summer. I’m exhausted at first, I have a tough time relating to the fact that she could feel so hopeless about something so far away, when all I’ve solidified is that I’m leaving the area in June, when neither of our personal projections seem at all exclusive of the other. I keep telling myself, “Don’t tell her to come with you, don’t tell her to come with you. ” So instead I just let her know that my desire to leave Massachusetts does not include a desire to leave anyone in my Massachusetts life. “I called Bill, because I wanted to be able to talk to someone who could make me feel better. And I just kept thinking about how he said he knew I’d be hurt by you…” She tells me that she knows she’s in love with me, and that her heart is entirely for me. The sun rises. As usual, this is our cue to end the conversation. I fall asleep. 50 I wake up just in time to start work. It’s very slow. I play with a Spanish-speaking cyber chameleon named Muy Loco and give balloons to small children. Dawn, who was my co-worker in the days of Saturday Matinee: The Movie Story, visits to say hi. Tina gives me a “just because” call, which is nice. She says that Bill keeps insisting that she see him before she comes out here. She doesn’t want that. On my break, I see a guy named John, whom I met a few weeks back when I went with Conor and Alice to Conor’s friend Daniel’s house in Northampton. He’s missed the last bus to Northampton. I tell him that I’m heading that way after work anyway, so I drive him home before heading to the club. I sit and watch the dance floor. I dance some, and have fun when I do. I’m involved in a nice hug circle outside, filled with ass-grabbing and innuendo though it is. I talk to an incredibly angry man who is looking to sublimate his anger over a dispute with his girlfriend by finding something of value to break. I check my pockets, consider offering a dollar bill, but figure that that’s unlikely to satisfy him. I say my goodbyes to people, planning to leave early. Charlie seems upset, because he doesn’t want to leave yet but was assuming that I’d be his transportation. I talk to him on the deck, then he goes inside. Only then do I notice that there’s a woman lying behind me, on top of the picnic table whose bench I’m sitting on. She’s facing upwards, watching the clouds. Her name is Jenny. I don’t really get her life story. I tell her mine and she makes appropriate comments about how her life has been relative to mine. A guy named Elin comes over and is cute and cuddly with her. They keep me occupied until they leave to dance. As it turns out, I don’t have to give anyone a ride, so I drive to the Whately Diner on my own, a little bit early. I sit down and talk to someone named Ellen. I don’t remember how I first met this Ellen, but I remember one night saying to Charlie, “Okay, I don’t remember having met her. Who is she?” after she came to the table where I was sitting. Ellen says that she’s had a bad day, that when she woke up she was suddenly hit by a bunch of things that hadn’t been bothering her before. I ask if it’s “the old not knowing what you want for yourself problem”. She says that it is. I tell her to move to New Zealand and raise sheep. I detail the logistics of how she could go about doing this. Charlie’s speech is non-stop on the drive home. He criticizes himself and then defends himself from his own attacks, in a hundred different ways with each passing minute. It makes me worried about him. “Ugh, why is the fan set on cold!” he says. “Um… I don’t know. Because the last time I thought to set it to a temperature, the car was warm?” I reply. “You’re really being a smart-ass tonight, aren’t you?” “No,” I say, in an annoyed voice, “I’m not. ” “Why are you still my friend, then, if I’m such a cunt!” I hesitate for about two seconds. “Well? Did you hear what I said?” “Yes, I heard. ” “And are you going to respond?” “I’m thinking,” I say. I park in front of his house. “I wish we had money for cigarettes,” he says. “Yeah,” I agree. “Oh, wait, I actually left my pack of Luckys inside, if my brother didn’t steal them. ” “Ooo. Would it be okay if I took a few of them?” “Yeah, that’d be fine. ” We go inside and find them. He prepares a bagel, and we sit outside while he eats it and we smoke. Then we talk some more, share the obligatory peck on the lips goodbye, and I drive home. 51 I wake up to a phone call from Tina. We talk for a while. I’m groggy the entire time and eventually say that I’ll see her online in about an hour, so that I can shower, and also so I can start cleaning procedures in preparation for her visit. I come online. Tina and I trade pictures back and forth, while Sarah N. tells me that I’m stuck in a cycle of letting myself get hurt and not asserting myself enough. Madeira says that Charlie really wants me to call, so I place up an away message and quickly go downstairs to my mother’s space to call from there. We talk for a few minutes, then I go upstairs to a chat room with Tina, Mick, and some of Tina’s friends. I talk on the phone with Tina for a few more hours after this. We read miscellaneous things to each other. I drive to the grocery store. I buy: medium shells, sparkling white grape juice, frozen pizza, Little Debbie oatmeal cookie cakes, a jump-rope with cow print handles, pulpy orange juice, cinnamon bagels, sparkling apple cider, mini marshmallows, two cans of green beans, tomato soup, a 6 pack of Tab, custard style yogurt, organic yogurt, colored chalk, dessert mints, and Success brand rice. I walk through the pretty, drizzly morning. I check the balance in my checking account. I’m pleased to find that the check I sent out to my credit card cleared. I have exactly enough cash on me, to the penny, to buy the cigarettes I want. The clerk gives me a free lighter when he can’t find any matches. When I walk outside, a man bums a cigarette, is very grateful, and says, “God bless you. ” I come home and clean and feel at home, lifting the shades and even opening the windows. 52 I learn how to remove pancake syrup from carpet, because life is funny/cruel like that and decides to leak about 8 ounces of the stuff all over the place on the morning while I’m cleaning for Tina’s visit. 14 hours left, and it’s a beautiful morning. 53 I paint my fingernails, only on one hand. I do pretty well, although I always mess up when I paint the thumb. I walk to buy coffee. Already overtired, I forget how many sugars I take, and end up adding twice the amount I usually would. I’m optimistic. I feel lucky today, on Good Friday the 13th of the year 2001. 8 1/2 hours left, and it’s a beautiful afternoon. 54 I talk with Charlie on the phone. He only mentions Tina once I bring up the subject of what we’re going to do after I get out from work and meet them outside of the mall. He implies that he expects us to stay at his house. 5 hours left, and the breeze has picked up a bit. "

    "body": "55 “Tina? It’s 7:00. ” “That wasn’t a half hour nap. ” “No, it wasn’t. ” “Would you be offended now if I just never left?” “No. ” (Time passes, I begin to sit up. ) (Waking up. ) “Where are you going?” (Settling back down into a cuddle) “I don’t know. ” “Where were you going to go?” “I was going to eat candy. ” “Okay. go and eat candy, then. ” “Should I not think about the fact that you’re supposed to be leaving?” “Do you want to think about it?” “…I’m going to go eat candy. ” (I get out of bed, walk a few feet away, kneel on the floor and eat a marshmallow cookie. ) “Levi… you’re too far away. ” 56 She is wearing my purple and black sweater. She plays the mix CD that she prepared for me. On the bed we write in our respective journals, shades drawn through the daylight hours. (Flashback) Seeing Mick before I see either Tina or Charlie, they enter the double set of mall doors. Charlie runs to use a restroom. We comment on the presence of a photo booth. Mick says, “You know, if we were to use the photo booth before Charlie returned, he’d probably get very angry!” Agreeing, I jump inside the booth mischievously. Charlie is going in Mick’s car, so I walk with Tina to mine. Inside, sitting. A moment to ourselves. She touches my hair, I hug her, we whisper questions of whether the other is pleased by our meeting in the flesh, we kiss… We ignore the time that we take. 57 Still, still. The night is so still and it flows around me like a photograph of myself. Charlie found Tina on Livejournal and befriended her. He kept telling me to add her as a friend. I did. Plans were in the works for her to come to the Valley and visit. We began to speak on the phone at length. She was in a relationship. She told her boyfriend, Bill, that she wanted to open their relationship, to see other people. He said no and told her that they would have to break up, then. Tina wanted to be “free to love. ” Bill hinted that he would show up at the bus terminal when Tina was set to leave. He did—but Tina had already taken an earlier bus, on which she met Maurice. Maurice coincidentally was coming from Cambridge to visit his girlfriend, Kim. Tina was supposed to leave after the weekend, to return to her life of working in retail and living in her mother’s house in eastern Massachusetts. She didn’t. Now we live together. She sees our lives as magical. “I haven’t met anyone I don’t like,” she says. Mick is in New York City. I forget how lengthy his stay is expected to be. Jonny is on his way to Seattle. I also forget for how long he’s going to be gone. 58 “Why are you with me?” asks Tina. “Wow. Maybe we should park the car somewhere for this one,” I say. “Why?” “Because thinking and driving, to me, don’t go very well together. ” “Okay. Do we have to get out?” “Oh, that’s right. You’d be cold. Well, before anything else, I would like to have a cigarette. Is that okay?” “Yeah. ” I pull into the parking lot of the Springfield Plaza. “Are you going to stay inside?” I ask. “No, I’ll go with you. ” “Would you like my coat?” “Yes. ” We both get out. I hand her my coat. “I need help getting this on,” she says, “No, hold the sleeves. Aargh! It’s cold!” She quickly goes back into the car: “I’m sorry. ” I nod, closing the door for her, putting on my coat and smoking. After finishing the cigarette, I get back in the car and say, “I just want to find out where the fates are leading me. And I don’t want to have to do it alone. ” 59 Monday is Necrology, the all-ages goth night. I’m holding onto Tina there, but also socializing. Tuesday is Haven, the 18+ goth night. Many of the people I would normally associate with are not present. I am passionate with Tina. I get Fuller’s life story at the Whately Diner afterwards. He talks about his ideas for a perpetual motion machine. Wednesday is arriving late to Fire &amp; Water, just in time to see that the last reader is James. I briefly see Kim, Carrie, Sarah N. , Carla, Diane G. , and Amy. I follow Adam G. as Charlie rides in his car, to UMass for socializing with others who had been at the café. Tina is saying that she’s uncomfortable with the combination of college and alcohol. We go back home, Charlie along with us, frustration and unpleasantness abound in the car. I try to stay detached but not totally silent. We drop Charlie off, check whether the Regal Cinemas have any late showings, find nothing, talk in the parking lot and on the ride home. I cook for Tina while she chats online with Maurice. 60 I’m sitting at the mall and updating from one of the Internet terminals. I’m here for job hunting with Charlie, Tina, and Madeira. Money is absurd. Tina and I need employment. Her standard of living is more expensive than mine. I just hope that we’ll be able to sustain ourselves. Yum, Pepsi. 61 Suddenly I’m not living only for myself: I’m living for myself and for Tina. I’m the one with the car, the money, the acquaintances, the knowledge of the area. There are moments when I want to curl up in a corner and watch while somebody else takes over, to let them make the decisions and figure out the best course of action. But that doesn’t happen because it can’t happen. So I turn into a walking zombie. Then people are offended. It’s hard enough for me to take care of myself: I’ve done a sloppy job of it. I’m cast as the role of leader when I don’t have a destination in mind. 62 Morning. Outside the Whately Diner. Beginning Day 11 of my life with Tina. My twentieth birthday gave us beautiful weather. The early morning was harsh and frustrating. However, following this we had the opportunity to sit around with Alice for awhile, then to go with her and Charlie to Fire &amp; Water, after which Charlie had run into a hallucinogen-loving acquaintance we’ll call Acid Todd. We dropped him and Charlie off at Charlie’s. Tina used the computer for a bit. She had a headache, so stayed home while I dropped off Alice. I came back home and, and, and so this led us to the late-late/early-early trip to the Whately. We planned to meet up there with Phil and to pick up Charlie and Todd. Madeira, as it turned out, arrived via bicycle, simply by chance, at Charlie’s, just before our arrival. So, he came too. We sat and ate and talked. 63 I pull out my notebook and pen, kneel down next to the subway tracks and begin to write. Tina: “So are you glad we’ve been given this night?” I: “I’m always glad. ” Tina: “Do you want to see my favorite place to write here?” I: “No, I’m quite fine writing here, thank you. ” Tina: “I just want to show you things!” Boston, Massachusetts. We have a night to spend before we can go to our destination, Tina’s old house. That guy with the guitar looked a lot like the musician Ben Lee. I know, because I had Ben Lee try to kill me that one time when I was at the front of the audience and he dove on top of me. 64 Tina: “I’m sad. ” I: “Why?” Tina: “It makes me sad to be here. Not here… (Points down to the coffee shop table) but here. (Makes an all-encompassing circle in the air with her finger. )” I: “What about it makes you sad?” Tina: “Being around here, I can feel Bill’s pain. ” 65 My view is that sparks of inspiration should never be (Interrupted by Tina) s (Interrupted by Tina) topped. (Interrupted by approaching train, we board. ) This (Touched on the shoulder by Tina) is what makes my move of becoming involved (Interrupted by Tina) with someone of such anxiety a trying one. (Person next to me moves, Tina moves to the seat next to me, puts her head on my shoulder. ) Of course, I’m working for us. But it’s strenuous. My brain hurts. We were going to wander around then it was okay that I wanted to go to Ceremony so that perhaps we’d find somewhere to be for the night rather than wandering the streets, and at least socialize, but then she insisted that we leave Boston (I’ve been looking forward to Boston for awhile, [Interrupted by Tina] wanting to visit) and go to her old hometown to… whatever until the early morning. I agreed, but really I feel so restrained that I just want to sleep and that’s always how it goes. (Interrupted by Tina) I should know better. T stop. 66 (Our trip to Boston features a random cameo appearance by the band The Amazing Royal Crowns: we walk past them on our way to catch the commuter rail. ) Maybe it’s a nasty trait of mine that I visit somewhere and just want to write, write, write. Maybe it’s because I equate living with words. I suppose, yes. Tina: “You belong in the city. You’re beautiful here. ” I: “Yeah. I’m a city person. ” (After talking to me about how appreciative she is that when she asks me why I’m silent, I try to answer her question. ) 67 (Talking about how this has been a bad day. ) I: “I’m happy now. ” Tina: “Why?” I: “I’m on a train, headed to a destination. And there’s no stopping it. Life used to be like that for me. Then things became more complicated. And I’ve been trying to find that again. I want to get back on that train. ” (Later, as I begin to write. ) Tina: “I’m scared. ” I: “Why?” Tina: “You’re acting towards me the way people usually do before they’re going to leave me. (I kiss her. ) I’m definitely terrified. ” (Again, as I write. ) Tina: “You get to meet my cat. ” I: “I like cats. ” Tina: “He’s mean. ” I: “I like mean cats. ” Over the tracks, the happiness of the rail. The walls go by. The distant objects move by with less speed than the objects in the foreground. 68 Pentagram sketched upon binder, Kurt Cobain smiling from the wall. Clothing pile, accelerated passage of time, her belly button as she adjusts her shirt. 69 Sunrise shaking melody like fingers through her hair and though I whisper I will not rest unheard 70 Oops! I sit down to write without noticing the couple making out in the car that I’m directly facing. Perhaps I should move. I gave Tina a ride to the Club Metro, but I didn’t feel like going myself. I have coffee. I’m wearing one of the jackets that she brought from her old bedroom. I look stylish. I’m still groggy. It’s early to me. 71 I pick up Tina and Charlie at Haven. Throughout the night, Charlie repeatedly says, “I hate everyone except Tina!” (About me he says, “No, I don’t hate you, You’re just a part of ‘everyone’ now. Just a little part of the grouping I don’t like. ”) Tina emphasizes that she had fun cuddling and smooching with Charlie at the club. Charlie responds to an offer from Tina for her to stay at our place by saying, “Well, I really don’t want to sleep on the couch. ” I jokingly say, in a pathetic voice, “Okay, I’ll sleep on the couch. ” “Well, I don’t want to make you do that,” he says. But I know that because of how late I awoke today, I’ll still be up when the two of them will want to sleep. So it goes. Charlie and Tina get the bed to themselves. (Tina asks if I am/would be weirded out by affections between her and Charlie. I say no. ) (Tina: “I’m scared about leaving the area this summer. I’m really starting to love it here, and I know that you’re ready to leave. I want to be with you. ”) I cover the two of them with blankets, bring them cigarettes, leave Charlie’s music playing, dim the lights for them and retreat to the Chaos Room. They’ve been talking now for over a half hour. 72 Charlie, talking with me, as I’m getting ready to leave for a walk and they’re getting ready to sleep: “I don’t see how you’re saying that I’ve been mean to you. I mean, I know that I told you, ‘I hate you’ a lot tonight, but…” 73 Tina’s stuff is on the couch. I guess that I could clear it off, but all of the pillows and blankets are in use. I could try to climb in bed with Tina and Charlie… but they both have a history of being mean to me in their sleep, so I might not survive that without a bloody nose. 74 Water is boiling on the stove. My mother walks out of her bedroom. “Good morning,” I say, “I thought you might be awake by now. ” “Yup,” she replies, “What’s up?” I pace about, not really facing her while I speak, and say, “I’m out of money. ” “What happened to your $60?” “That trip to Boston. ” “Have you done any more looking for jobs?” “Not really. ” “Why not?” “I haven’t had the chance. ” “Well, you need to prioritize. ” “Right now, my priorities are… Tina… and then finding a new job. ” “But you need a job if you want to make Tina a priority. ” “I know. ” “I suppose I need to get gas after your using the car tonight?” “No, there’s some left in there. ” “Yeah, because I put $20 in the other day. Are you getting paid this week?” “No. Actually, wait. Yes. On Friday, I’ll have some money. And Tina will be getting a check in the mail hopefully tomorrow. Do you think i could get maybe $10 for now?” “On my dresser. Don’t wake up Bruce. ” I plan to walk, but the discman I find (of the several which are kicking around somewhere in the apartment) doesn’t seem to be working properly, so carefully I steal a pillow from under Tina’s head, find a spare comforter in the closet, and sleep on the floor. I get four hours of sleep before a phone call wakes me up. It’s Conor, wanting to be picked up later on and taken to Fire &amp; Water for the poetry night. He says that someone from the Drama Club, Julia H. , wants to come, too. I arrange to pick them up at 5:00 from HCC. My four hours of sleep seem to have served me well; I am refreshingly awake. Tina and Charlie are still lying in the same position they had been before. 75 “Not unlike the great Joe Jackson, I’m stepping out” for my break from a shift at Nancy’s Coffee Café. I find a woman smoking outside of Lord &amp; Taylor, probably in her mid ’40s. I ask her if she has an extra. “You shouldn’t be smoking,” she tells me. Near the bus stop, a man is handing out business cards for something about weight loss. “Are you looking to find what you can do to live healthier?” he asks me. Knees against my chest, I take another drag from my cigarette. “Probably not, huh?” 76 Tina is going to sleep. I just woke up. I play guitar and sing. I stumble through songwriting, the inspiration hitting but not sticking. The night before was eventful, but without my assistance. I fell asleep with Charlie, Tina, and Madeira in the house. Tina, watching old videos, then coming into the bedroom crying because she was affected by memories of Bill. She had a conversation with him online and became even more upset. Phil agreed to pick up Tina to try and help. Charlie was upset that he wasn’t invited. Charlie and Madeira were dropped off by Phil, Madeira at his place and Charlie at his mom’s. He and Tina drove around and talked. I’m in a good mood, now. Charlie walks up the steps and I greet him. He’s being nice to me. Tina is still sleeping. I take Charlie to HCC, since I’m awake during the day, the sun is shining, and I have time to kill. We first run into Anna E. , Christian and Julissa. We all talk some. I show Charlie the green room. We wander outside and Charlie has by now occupied himself with talking to new people. I see Delphine, she calls me over, we hang out with her and a guy Charlie is talking to. I run into other miscellaneous people. I take Charlie back to my place, wake Tina up, Charlie’s mom picks up Charlie. Tina and I prepare for her job interview at Friendly’s in the Holyoke Mall. She gets the job, yay! and I drop her off at Charlie’s so that they can adventure while I work. When my shift is over, I go to Northampton to find them. First I run into Delphine, who is heading into Herrell’s Ice Cream. She’s working there. She asks me if I want free ice cream. I say yes and get Mint Cookies n’ Cream. Tina and Charlie come in. They get free ice cream, too. Charlie gets offended because I don’t feel like talking about the plans that he wants to make for us tomorrow. A guy in a Superman tank-top—he must have been cold, wearing only that—comes by to try to sell us his zine. We all buy copies. Delphine goes back to work. We go to the Northampton Lodging, per request of Charlie. Tina and I sit and read while Charlie runs around, not finding anyone. He leaves with his friends to go to a keg party in Amherst. Tina and I go to Fire &amp; Water. When I go outside for a cigarette break, Alfie the dog comes over to me. He knows where to go for the best puppy massages around. It begins to look like I have another night of sleep deprivation ahead of me. "

    "body": "77 Tina comes over from quality cuteness time with Charlie. She: “Are you okay?” I: “No. ” “Love you. ” “Love you. ” (She puts her hand down my turtleneck. ) “Ow! Cold!” “Okay. ” (She cheerfully returns to Charlie. ) I feel like I wasn’t meant to interact with the outside world in a fun and casual manner, after all. (Syrma paid me back the $50 that I lent her. I’m grateful. ) 78 (Clarification) Tina and I had about two hours to waste after Charlie took off to Amherst, before 2 AM when we were to meet Kilean at the park. There was Fire &amp; Water, then sitting on a bench and talking, then waiting outside of Herrell’s until Delphine came out. Delphine talking about feeling left out of the clique at work and asking questions about Charlie, then leaving. Tina and I going to buy stuff at convenience stores, then going to the park, where Charlie’s companions Matt and Tim were. (“Charlie stopped to talk to Mike. He’ll be here in a little bit,” they say, although I have no idea who this Mike is, Mike being one of those names that needs a helping adjective to mean anything. ) Kilean shows up on his skates. Tina hands him the Red Bull that she bought him as a gift. He punctures a hole in it with scissors before gulping down the contents of the can over the course of about ten seconds. Charlie shows up. Kilean, wondering where Phil, Angus, Jessica, Isaac and Syrma are at, calls on his cell phone. “They were sleeping, the pantywaists!” he says, “‘What’s this? ‘It’s Friday night, let’s go to sleep at midnight’? Yeesh. ” Eventually, the others show up. By then I’m… thinking. Growing sad in a worrisome way. I tell Tina that I want to go home. She says that she wants to stay, that she’ll find a way to get home or else find somewhere else to go. Charlie suggests that the two of them stay in Harold’s room, since he’s out of town and left the door unlocked. I drive home, go to sleep and wake up six hours later. Tina still is not around. 79 I spend four dollars to receive a collect telephone message from Tina. It’s delivered to me after I disconnect the modem. It’s from this morning. She says that she’s staying with Charlie in Harold’s room, that she’ll call in the afternoon. 80 I go to visit Annie, but first I stop at the 7-11 to buy her a Slurpee. I also visit the liquor store. Annie and I talk for a while. I manage to force out some talk from myself about how I’ve been. I leave and go to Northampton. I get a coffee to go from Fire &amp; Water. Anna E. and Nate are there. I talk to them a bit as well as others who are around. I exit and see Charlie. He’s on his way to the lodging to grab her things. Kurt Vonnegut walks by. Charlie whispers to me, “That was Kurt Vonnegut. ” Then we go to Harold’s room. Charlie wants to take a shower, so I go to tell Tina, who waits at the park. 81 On Harold’s mattress. Tina is cold. 82 Fire &amp; Water is lovey. Comfortable. Good. A contrast to, ugh, the situation that I was just in. Charlie, whose every other word is an attack against me that drains me, shoves me away, feeling like a battle scene from Sailor Moon or something, like on some other plane he’s landing punches and kicks as I try to crawl away in escape. He’s basically saying, “Well, I’m all set for the night. I don’t know about Tina, but oh well, since you’re such a prick that you don’t want to give her the ride home that you wouldn’t have the time to give, I don’t know why you’re still here, you might as well leave, even though Tina’s crying. ” And I can’t deal and there’s nothing I can do and I don’t want to deal with the pain so I say, “I’m going. ” “Where?” asks Tina. “Outside. You can join me if you want. ” I start to open the door behind her. “No!” she says, closing the door, “Not until you tell me what’s going on. ” But what was going on was that Tina and Charlie had their own plans. They had stayed in town the night before, fine. They wanted to go to The Grotto tonight, fine. But suddenly I was being demonized because I didn’t want to drive them back to Chicopee before I came back to town tonight to see Antigone—because it’s not my car, it’s my mother’s car, and every time I see her she scolds me for using it too much. It’s a lease vehicle so she’s worried about mileage. I raised my voice to say that I was leaving, was told not to raise my voice, even though 90 percent of the words Charlie ever speaks to me are in a yelling tone, each word of which pains me, because I hate yelling, hate hate. I sit outside of the lodging, they come out, I hand Tina $20 because I’m the only one with money. She says, “Well, we can buy clothes, that’ll solve everything” in a jabbing voice. 83 Waiting for the play to start. Dave Russo is here. This space is really something. I remember taking a weekend workshop here. I’ve moved from frustration to sadness in a want-to-cry sort of way. Just paying to get in, I felt awkward. I couldn’t talk to people. Living is a challenge for me sometimes. 84 I get to fearing that my presence is an intrusion. Maybe because of things like… after the play, Carla came up to me and said, “Next time, don’t sit in the front row. It was so hard to stay focused. ” Dangit, why can’t I be just another audience member! I was really antsy because I had to pee for most of the play. I guess that might have had something to do with it. 85 I came here, to The Grotto, because I couldn’t bring myself to go home without Tina. That would be two nights of sleeping without her. No. Not what I’m looking for, thanks. I see her and she’s giving flirtatious looks to a figure I don’t bother to look at. I sit by her, waiting to be noticed. She notices me and at first doesn’t move or speak, only tenses up. Then: “How was the show?” “It was good. ” “Did you get to talk to people after?” “I hung around for a bit, yeah. ” I ask if she wants to move to somewhere further away from the speakers so that we can talk. She walks quickly and harshly ahead of me to a table. “You really hurt me and Charlie. ” “I was really hurt by you and Charlie. ” She doesn’t believe me, or plays off that she doesn’t buy it: “How did we hurt you?” 86 I’ve been told that I try too hard, that I put too much energy into things and people for little to no personal gain. But the point is that I can’t stop feeling what I feel. I tend to make a point of telling people, “I can’t promise that we’ll be together forever, but I can promise that I’ll love you forever. ” And that’s not bullshit! I’m not making this up. I’m cold now. I sit in the parking lot, having exited the Grotto, saying that I was going to buy cigarettes and wait outside the club until the night was over, at which point I would fulfill my driving duties. Love, love, love, hurts so much. But at least with Tina I have someone willing to try and accept the fact that I don’t just love one person at a time—I love in general. 87 But, yeah. So, hello. Hi, this is me and everything. Um… uh-huh. I’m in the Chaos Room. Mmm, cigarette. Um. So, this open relationship thing, it’s interesting, somehow when things happen to me it’s like, I’m good at dealing with a lot of things, I’m very strong, but, you know, my situations are always really strange, like they’re designed specifically to test me. I mean, Tina was talking about how she’s scared about my moving away this summer, and it looks now like she’s definitely going to stay here when I go, and… yeah. But, like, she said, “So you aren’t going to go run off with somebody else while you’re there,” or something, and I just thought to myself, “Um, if I’m going to be in a different part of the country indefinitely, it’s a possibility. And, to look at you, after about a cumulative twenty-four hours of time spent away from me you were involved with someone, and although I’m happy for you both and give my total blessing, for whatever that’s worth, it was with Charlie, who was specifically the one human being in the world I would be least comfortable about your having an involvement with. ” She spoke with enthusiasm to me about how great it was to be intimate with Charlie. Poking fun at her frequent jests that I have secret dates when she’s not looking, I said, “Well, if I were to not really have to work today, but I were really running out to meet somebody, could I tell you how great it was to be with her, or him?” “Yes. ” “Would you like it?” “No. ” “Would it make you uncomfortable?” “Probably. ” She rolled over and said, “I’m sorry. I won’t talk about it anymore. ” “No,” I say, “I want to hear. I just found it… funny that you were talking to me about it like it was a trip to the carnival or something: ‘And there was cotton candy!’” “Well, I’m like that with talking about sex. It’s weird. ” Me: “Talking with Charlie, did you get the impression that this might be an ongoing thing?” “Yes. ” So I’m thinking of this as, um, I know that I can’t serve as transportation and everything for Tina and Charlie. Charlie’s too uncomfortable with me around and I know that Tina’s been having fun hanging out, so I think she’ll kind of be doing her own thing a lot, and then so will I. And she really wants to stay in this area, and it’s probably a whole lot healthier that she’s now found somewhere comfortable than when she said she’d follow me anywhere (before we had even met). So, it looks like there’ll be a point after which we’ll be apart. But there are still a lot of good times that we can have. 88 I saw Sarah N. again recently. She told me to quit slouching. She said she had heard through the grapevine that I was heading west this summer. She wished me luck. 89 I never did write about Sunday morning, so I’ll just say: I drove from the Grotto, stopped at Harold’s, and Charlie got out to grab his things, then he suggested Dunkin’ Donuts for some free food and drink from someone he knew. I didn’t want anything, but I drove us there. Charlie decided he wanted to stay at his mom’s place; when we got there, he said, “Let’s have a cigarette on the steps first” so we did, and all of us talked, although mostly it was me saying to Charlie things that I had already said to Tina. We went downstairs and tucked Charlie into bed. Tina and I came home and lay on the couch, talking for a bit. I was tired and emotional, wanting to fall asleep with Tina next to me, but she wanted to do her LiveJournal things. She did that for about a half hour before coming to bed, at which point we talked some more. I discovered that I couldn’t sleep, tired though I was. I went online. Much to my surprise, Liv invited me out for breakfast. She picked me up and we went to the Holyoke Friendly’s near the mall, where we traded stories. I came back home, woke up Tina, dropped her off at Charlie’s and went to work. But work didn’t want me, saying that I didn’t have to work today because of budget cuts. At home I talked to Tina on the phone from Charlie’s. The two of them plus Madeira were heading out for adventure. I was too tired to feel like I was up for a day of wandering, so I fell asleep, feeling lonely. I woke up at 4 AM, not having heard from anyone. Now I’m smoking many cigarettes. 90 At the Holyoke Mall, updating my LiveJournal from the computer terminals once more. I’m here with Julissa and Michelle O. on one of those random mall runs that HCC students enjoy going on. Plans are to meet up with Tina and Charlie at Fire &amp; Water tonight, when I head there to play at the open stage. Apparently they tried calling last night, but I slept through the ringing phone. They wound up staying over at Mick’s. My nail polish is chipping. Maybe I’ll find someone who’ll let me borrow theirs so that I can be all the more a rock star when I perform tonight. 91 I take Conor to Northampton. We stop in at Fire &amp; Water first, leave my things there and walk to see if Downtown Sounds is open, because I need a guitar pick. On the way we run into Charlie and his friend Emily. Charlie tells me that Tina took a bus to Chicopee hours before. I plan to call home, to make sure she’s there and then drive to pick her up. Much to my delight, though, Tina is sitting in front of Fire &amp; Water and listening to headphones. Immediately we kiss and kiss and kiss. I’m really happy to see her. She tells me that she went home, showered and changed, then took another bus up to Northampton. We go to meet Charlie and Emily by my car. They’re burning a candle that they found at the side of the road. It’s a nice candle. I’m sure that I’ve seen one just like it before. Some street kid types come by, who apparently kept Charlie and Tina company this morning. They all go by funny names. “Sup, I’m L,” says one, making his hand into the shape of an L. “Can I call you Mr. L?” I ask. He says no. Tina and I go for a walk alone. We lie in the grass with each other. “Get a room!” yells someone in a passing vehicle. “But it’s far away!” I yell back. At Fire &amp; Water, the open stage begins. As the night goes on more and more people come by until I realize that about one third of the people who are in the café are there to see me. Tina mentioned to different people that I was going to play, so a big mass of people who wouldn’t usually hang out at Fire &amp; Water end up watching. It’s really neat. Kilean, Krissy, and Larry are there, plus Madeira and Isaac. I play “So Frolic the Immortals” and “Skin”. Conor says that the former inspires a story that he writes, and Tina says that the latter “made Kilean’s head bop—just a little! Like, a quarter inch!” So, I feel good about the night. Star, the owner, takes over the open stage to do his Salmonboy performance. I talk to Carrie for a bit and to no avail try to convince the cellist from Hospital, who are playing next, to give me and let me keep her instrument. Then Tina tells me that she wants to leave. 92 While I’m working a girl comes up to the counter and asks if I remember her. I do. This is Jill, somebody who threw up during one of the performances of Hamlet I was in, who was working the register when I bought art supplies to use in Memory of a Nightmare, who when we later ran into each other at Haven was impressed by how many people we had both known, the concerts we had both been to, and so on. She asks me whether I would model for her, for a photo shoot for a photography class she’s taking. I don’t get many details, but I say that I’ll do it. She says she wants to do the shoot at Chicopee High School. She gets my number and leaves. 93 At the Whately Diner. Annie is letting me use her journal pen. She says that I should feel special. I do. Larry agreed to pay for my coffee and soda. I’m still trying hard to grow comfortable with the nature of my relationship with Tina. I don’t think she’s having the same troubles. I envy her for that. When we’re together, alone, things are intense. But she needs her adventure… a lot. And that’s when the insecurities that I do have rear their head. I know these are issues I can get past. It’s just hard switching between modes A + B—A being the two of us living our lives as one, accommodating each other; B being my sleeping without her next to me. She can be really distant sometimes; the irony is that I can now see how my behaving similarly must have hurt people in the past. I look into memories and start to feel guilty for all the times in my life when I might have hurt others. 94 At the club on Tuesday, people are being whipped while they’re chained to a cross. I run around. It’s fun for a while. The night is finished by two goth Smashing Pumpkins covers in a row, “Soma” and “Cherub Rock”. Mick shows up to the Whately Diner and is happy when I randomly recite Dr. Dre. Tina doesn’t want to come home with me. She wants to hang out with Phil all night, and specifically not with me. “It’s okay,” I say, “Just know that things have been so up and down with the nature of our relationship that… (I stumble while looking for the words)… when you distance yourself, I have to grow comfortable with that level of distance… that’s what I start to accept as the way things are…” “You love me?” she asks. “I love you. I’ll always love you. ” “I don’t want to hurt you,” she says. “Don’t worry about hurting me. Do what you want for yourself. Just know that… (I stumble more, stumble more)… I was starting to work on us having a life where we could come home to each other,” I say. “We still have a home together,” she responds. “No, not really,” I say, “And it’s probably better that way. ” I know that I’ve stopped being a priority. So, what was “our life” briefly has been split again into “her life” and “my life”. She’s not there for me very much. She was trying for awhile, but I guess that I was too complicated for her to keep trying any longer. Yeah. So, now, waiting for my mother to come home, so that I can ask for money as I hate doing, and leave, run from my apartment as I used to. At least I had a home for almost two weeks. Now I’m wandering again. 95 Charlie comments in my LiveJournal, telling me to get in touch with him. I sign off, call his house, am told that he’s at Mick’s. I throw my phone against the wall. It falls behind the bed. Seconds later, it rings. I fish it out. It’s Alice, wanting to arrange plans so that I can pick her up for Fire &amp; Water tonight. I say that I’ll call her before I leave to pick her up. I stand up and stretch, only to inadvertently stick my fist into the ceiling fan. A small chunk of skin is torn off from my knuckle. I wash the wound. I try to find change for cigarettes. I notice a $20 bill on the table, shrug my shoulders and take it. 96 (Inside Fire &amp; Water. ) I stand in line behind the counter. I look around. The girl in front of me stares into my eyes. I stare back. She looks away and apologizes. I say that I’m feeling a little dazed. I ask if I know her. She says no. I get to the counter, where Kim is taking orders. I plop down a dollar and a quarter. “What can I get you, Levi?” she asks. “I’d like a cup of coffee, to celebrate the best breakup ever,” I say. She looks at me in surprise. We had talked earlier about Tina and me. “What happened?” she asks. “She left me for someone else,” I respond. “Someone else? Who?” “Phil. ” She doesn’t know of him. She slides my money back to me and hands me a cup. “I’m just glad that things ended well,” I say, “I went and had a talk with my friend Alice, the girl who was over here, and I got a lot of things out that I’d been feeling, so I was in a good mindset. ” “Are you okay?” she asks. “Yeah,” I tell her. She takes my hand and looks at it. “Are you looking at my nail polish?” I ask. “You’re shaking,” she says. (Earlier in the night, outside Fire &amp; Water. ) Charlie comes over from Haymarket, where a Goth Coffee gathering is going on. “Tina told me to tell you that she’ll be over whenever you’re ready to go, because she needs to get to work tomorrow and she says she ‘can’t exactly stay out until 6 AM again’. ” I shake my head and roll my eyes. Understandingly, he says, “Yeah, so that kind of sucks, she just comes home with you because she has to work. ” “Yeah, that does suck!” I say strongly. “Are you fuming?” “I’m fuming!” I say assertively. We sit down to talk a little bit later. He says, “Yeah, so I’m kind of upset with Tina. She was giving me these nasty looks whenever I would, like, touch Phil in the slightest way. ” “Well, that’s no good,” I say. “Yeah. She says that she’s scared to go home with you tonight because she knows you’ll be hurt. ” “Hurt by what?” “Well, I should let her talk to you, I guess. But, like…” He continues. He rests his head on my shoulder. We conclude that we’re both the eyes of our own hurricanes, now combined to form some kind of super-storm. Tarah comes over, and when she asks what the situation is, Charlie bluntly says, pointing to me, “His girlfriend is having sex with me and a guy I have a crush on. ” Tina comes by. I don’t say much to her. She and Charlie walk to buy cigarettes. (Other moments. ) Talking with Alice in the park, I feel comforted, since I’ve been having a lot of troubles with figuring out what friendship means and what I need to let into my life. I’m happy to find that I can talk with her on a level that’s been lacking for me in recent times. This is what prepares me for when I sit down next to Tina, when she cries for a few moments, gets distracted by something and laughs and tells fun stories for a few moments, then says that she doesn’t want to hurt me. “Phil and I found that… we really like each other. ” The two of them had had one of those magical, romantic days of infinite bliss. “Are you going to kick me out?” she asks through tears. “No, I’m not,” I say, “The way your feelings obviously are, I mean, we’ll need to kind of renovate how we deal with each other…” and when I say that, I can tell by her reaction that she doesn’t want anything anymore. I go through the motions of getting her to tell me. “You don’t want a relationship with me anymore, do you?” I ask. “Well, a relationship, I mean, not what you mean by relationship, but… I still love you, and I don’t want you to hurt. ” “And I love you, and always will. But you don’t want us to be together anymore?” She shakes her head. I end up laughing, saying that my life story just keeps getting more and more complicated and difficult to tell. She’s scared by my laughter. I drop off Alice, her being the only one getting a ride home from me. I ask her what she thinks the requirements of a real friendship are. We discuss this for awhile. We get to her house. Sharing a never-ending hug, I call her my friend. We talk about how we need to hang out with each other more often. I’ve never been broken up with before, but in the aftermath I can feel free. I have got a clean slate and I feel like writing. As Alice and I started yelling in the park: “Go! Go! GO!” "

    "title": "V. Free to Love (97-106)",
    "body": "97 The three of us lie in grass, by a swingset. We watch twinkling stars. The tops of our heads touch, so that our bodies are positioned like petals of a flower or blades of an electric fan. Mick tells his favorite story about the time he spent in Geneva, Switzerland. I’ve heard it before, I’ve heard it many times before; but for Robyn’s sake, I let him continue. Western Massachusetts. I know that Mick’s not long for this area, that I’m not long for this area, that Robyn, whom I’ve just met, is new to this area. I know that there’s nothing to hold onto. We laugh, smoke cigarettes, and move on. Late into the night, I visit Robyn’s house. Scribbled words on post-it notes cover squares of the wall to the side of her bed. She tells me that these are a work of art which will take her a long time to complete. I tell her my story of the past few months. She trusts me, but she is afraid of my life. She tells me this. 98 Robyn leaves her pack of American Spirits on a grassy hill by a parking lot in Northampton while we make the journey north to the Whately Diner. We return to find them unharmed. We talk about energy, relaxation, reincarnation, and telekinesis. We talk about the fates and what we think their motivations might be. We talk about the spirits we’ve known, and why we do or do not feel safe talking about them. “Where do spirits go when they disappear?” I ask. “I don’t know. They go to love, I suppose. ” We talk about this universe and how proximal or distal we think it is. “It can’t be that proximal,” she says, “Or we’d just use magic openly. It wouldn’t be a problem. ” “It can’t be that distal,” I smile, “Or we wouldn’t be able to have this conversation. ” 99 Scented candles are lit around my apartment. I’ve taken Alice here partially due to a lack of ideas, and partially because I’m looking to reclaim this space as my own. It should feel like a home to me, but it’s grown all the more unwelcoming since my and Tina’s dissolution. Alice’s ear has been supportive; over the past weeks, we’ve become close friends. I imagine that her presence will help. We sit in the Coalescence Room—also known as the living room. Over the course of an hour, she explains to me her history of abuse. I clutch a red candle with both hands. “I don’t know if you want to hear this part,” she says, “It’s not easy to hear. ” “You lived it. The least I can do as a friend is to hear it,” i respond. She finishes. I offer her the candle. Carefully, she drips its hot wax along the length of her upper arm. “Sometimes I can make really nice designs,” she says, “this would make a really good photograph. ” She falls asleep on me. I join her in dozing off for several minutes before I wake back up. I use the bathroom. When I return she’s lying on the couch, fading in and out of consciousness. I set a pillow under her head and a blanket around her, then go to sleep on my bed. It’s a good sleep. 100 The progression of thoughts in my mind as I smoke the first cigarette of the morning, reconstructed after the fact: I feel icky this morning. What should I do? I need something to drink. I have soda. I always drink soda. Soda won’t help my physical problems. Juice would be good. But I don’t have any juice. I don’t want to go out and buy some, I feel too yucky. I could go downstairs and take some from my mom. I hate doing that. And I’d have to remember where I put the keys. I’ll have a cigarette. Great, I think to myself that I’m feeling awful, so I’ll have a cigarette. I sure treat myself well. Mmm, cigarette. Let’s see, what do I have to do today? Picnic. I have to pick up Julia. She waxes her eyebrows and tans. Getting to talk to her makes me think about how few frontiers there are left in understanding people. I have to figure out when I’m picking up Alice, too. “I have been to Paris, I have been to Rome, I have gone to Milan and I am all alone”: Karl at Nancy’s never stops playing Counting Crows while he’s there. But I’ve always been in the United States. Maybe it’s this country that’s the problem. Henry Miller thought that America was the saddest place in the world. What’s with the random guy who always says, “Henry Miller!” when he sees me on the street, then walks off with no explanation? Okay, I’ve finished my cigarette. What now? 101 The afternoon, outside the mall with Marie, smoking cigarettes and chatting. She’s on break from her job at Charlotte Russe. I just left work at Nancy’s Café. She: “Now, Chinese restaurants, right? Especially the Hu Ke Lau. Which is technically Polynesian, but the point stands. Notorious—notorious! for serving alcohol to underage kids. Now, I’m at the counter, and I buy a pack of cigarettes. And the guy behind the counter asks for I. D. , so I pull out my learner’s permit, and since I know that’s not plastic, also my credit card, which is there, proof that I’m eighteen, I need to be eighteen to have this, here it is. He doesn’t sell me the pack of cigarettes. Never mind that there’s a table of what looks obviously to be a table of sixteen year old girls drinking white zinfandel right behind me. But okay, okay. That didn’t even bother me, I didn’t get the pack of cigarettes, okay. But why are they drinking white zinfandel at sixteen? That’s an old lady drink! That’s your great-aunts getting together at a wedding reception and getting trashed!” I: “But at least it wasn’t beer. You have to give them credit for having wine instead of beer. ” She: “This is true. Wine, wine is a good drink. I would rather see them drinking wine than beer. But rather than wine, I would much rather see them drinking hard liquor. When I was sixteen, it was just, bring on the shots of tequila. At sixteen, they should just be saying, ‘Bring me a big jug with Xs on it. Can you get me that? And afterwards, I’ll make some music with it. ’” I: “See, this is what’s wrong with kids these days. As much as we might try and push kids in the right direction, trying to get them to appreciate the beauty of jugs, I mean, specifically targeting kids—Emmett Otter, for instance! They don’t appreciate the beauty in that. ” She: “They just don’t understand. ” I: “This country is going to hell in a hand-basket. Kids these days are just too busy shooting up smack, having sex with strangers, and not smoking cigarettes to appreciate the finer things in life. ” A woman sitting several feet away from us giggles the whole time. 102 Friends of me should be aware that I will be gone within five weeks. 103 Tuesday, I adventure with Scientist Jen. Through the night. After driving by to drop a walkman in the mailbox of her parents’ house so her brother can borrow it, going to the Dunkin Donuts in Feeding Hills, finding that the lobby is closed, getting the employee on shift to open the back door, having him ask us what we want but going to the drive-thru just to save the awkwardness of being special. Sitting in front of one of the closed stores at the stopping center to drink our coffees, talking, having not one but two police cruisers pull up to ask what we’re doing, saying we’re just drinking coffee and surprisingly not being told to relocate. Driving around, stopping at a rest area on Interstate 91 it’s dark and I spin my lit cigarette in circles. One truck backs up slowly in a straight line through the rest area. We wonder what it’s doing. We go to the lake at Smith College, looking across at the sign that says, “Smith 2001”. A man whistles, jumps in, swims across the lake and back. Jen and I talk about deep, dark secrets, because that’s the topic that I bring up. Looking at trees, talking about trees, street signs, a long hug. As I always say, I never let go first, why would I let go? The Whately Diner, where everyone’s run to after the club. Charlie saying I haven’t been a good friend. My exhaling after everyone leaves, asking Kelly the Waitress a philosophical question while she cleans a table and “Imagine” plays on the jukebox. On Jen’s steps, hearing more stories of conflict and pain and absorbing like I always absorb while the rain falls. Wednesday, canceling plans with Conor, Alice, Julia H. , and Kestrel for Fire &amp; Water because I want to sleep… but then not being able to sleep and going on my own. Feeling sad. Thursday, nothing. Friday, coffee with Barry at his apartment, Graff coming in and venting about how everyone’s crazy, my making silly comments to make them smile, knowing that when you need to make someone smile is when you hardly have any power at all, running to the other room when I hear on the television the old public service announcement for the Homeless National Switchboard, the one with the song that goes, “When times get rough, you can fall back on us. Don’t give up, please don’t give up…” because as a small child I already had been able to see a piece of myself in that scared, homeless adolescent girl. Saturday, Patrick coming over, and us heading to Fire &amp; Water. Getting a coffee and a cappuccino, sipping alternately, Alice shows up with a friend whose name I already forget. I jump around outside singing the “Say how do you do and shake hands” song from Disney’s Alice in Wonderland while others clap in time. Meeting Alix, trying on her glasses and deciding that I then became her. Watching the game of chess excitedly, asking Alice and her friend how the conversation was going, and when they said it wasn’t very interesting saying, “Okay, I’m going to throw down a subject and you’ll talk about it and it’ll be interesting. Bondage! Discuss,” but that not working and changing the subject to flowers and having it work out. After the Eric Underwood Band is finished playing, I point as the cellist walks to the bathroom and exclaim, “Cellist!” The guy who’s always at Fire &amp; Water whose name I forget and I both get to play her cello. Rage Against the Machine plays over the speakers; seeing strangers dancing wildly in the middle of the closing down café to it, I join in, then pull the little drums off the wall and play them along with Fire &amp; Water Ben (an employee there) to the beat of the music, Pepper (the other employee working that night) kicking everyone out early. Talking with Alix outside about writing, looking through a notebook in her bag while she waits for Fire &amp; Water Ben to get out, she and Patrick talking about Radiohead, Fire &amp; Water Ben getting out and then pulling out a big tackle box and proudly explaining the names of each lure, giving Patrick the “Bass Assassinator”. Going to the Whately Diner, where it appears that all of the staff are new and nothing is going right. I talk to Patrick through my sad smiling reminiscence about the past, present, future, love—things it’s usually tough for me to say. 104 Cuddling with Scientist Jen on the roof of Fire &amp; Water. She: “Tell me the meaning of life. ” (Turned around, of course, because I always ask people the meaning of life. ) I: “Cows. Ask me again. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Grazing. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Manure. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Carrots. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Weight loss. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Seventeen magazine. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Anorexia. ” And on and on, until: “What’s the meaning of life?” And then we kiss. After coming down from the roof, finding Robyn and Tina being joyful on the streets, being taken along to the housing complex where someone we know is staying. The apartment buzzers don’t work past 11 PM so Tina says “stand back” and forcibly yanks the door open. We walk through the long bland hallways and up stairs, but he isn’t home. Robyn covering her eyes and letting us lead her as we walk—like a trust game. 105 In the afternoon I wake up next to Scientist Jen. It’s Memorial Day. We go to the Village Commons in South Hadley, thinking to eat at Tailgate Picnic or somesuch, forgetting that many places are not open on holidays. We end up eating at the Holyoke Mall. We pick up Julia H. , who’s made the name “Levi” out of wire, hung on a string. I wear it around my neck all night. She says it’s embarrassing and for me not to tell people that she made it; I ignore this and give her proper credit with all due enthusiasm. Drop off Jen, go to Fire &amp; Water. Star, the owner, is sitting outside and looking at a real estate catalog. The air is damp, but the sky is not dark. I ask whether it hailed and thundered here in Northampton like it did in Chicopee. He says yes and compares the current rain to the weather in the Pacific Northwest. I mention Portland. He says good things about it and adds that there’s a big connection between this area and there. I practice before the open stage begins on a hill a couple streets down, while children run about and play. I sit on the dumpster next to a ska girl from NYC named Rachael. I play her guitar. Nathan and Tarah say hello. Patrick shows up with his guitarist, whom I haven’t met before. My name is called early, in the middle of my buying coffee. For the second week in a row I’m unprepared as I run up to the performance space: “Uh, wait, where’d I put my guitar? Oh, there it is. And my pick, um?” Someone hands me a pick. I play “The Mote Divine” and “Pieces”. I get lots of happy congratulations; Harvey asks me why I don’t do more with my music, saying that I “could actually be big”. Star tells me that I need new strings on my guitar. It’s a good night. One guy plays some form of bagpipes, Tarah’s sister plays and is exceptionally good, a guy sings a song about falling in love with a Denny’s waitress. Someone goes up, before anything else says that she’s new to the area and wants to form a ska band, plays guitar for a song, then sings some a capella jazz but apparently loses it, ending with “ba da ba ba da baaa… shit!” She vanishes soon after. Star finishes up the night by playing a couple songs and telling everyone that he’s trying to sell Fire &amp; Water. Krissy drives by and stops to say hello to me, just back from the Dracula’s Ball in Philadelphia. I talk with Harvey. Cassie, a friendly hippie townie, comes out from the café. I ask her if she’s still going to Portland, because she’d mentioned plans for an all-girl road trip to there. She says she’s not sure, that Georgia’s a possibility too, that she only knows she needs to get out of the area. I tell her that I’m going. She says she wants to come, that she’d be able to afford busing it with me. Julia H. condemns my excessive smoking. I mumble about how it replaces things like feeling comforted, connected, etc. She offers to let me rest my head on her. After about thirty seconds of my attempts at relaxation, she says, “Do you feel connected yet?” and I say, “Not quite”, sit up, and re-light my cigarette. Tina takes me aside and talks. “Even though I know my life is filled with all these romantic happenings and stuff, I still feel lonely,” she says. “But I’m feeling comfortable around you again—like, right now I don’t feel tense talking to you,” she says. “I feel tense talking to you right now. Because I have to pee,” I respond. I give her a small hug. She clutches onto me and starts crying. Before the night is over I talk a little more with Julia. I give her the basics of a guitar lesson. I tell some of the story of V. , then explain that I’m going to stay with her and her boyfriend in Portland. “That’s pretty intense,” she says. “Nah,” I say. We leave when Fire &amp; Water Ben leaves. I drive Julia home as she talks about relationships. I come back to my apartment and look around it. 106 A small space where I like to sit in the outside wall of Barnes &amp; Noble, because most people couldn’t sit there—my combination of being small and dexterous with a little butt letting me sit there (like a windowsill with no window)—and Alice is there. She smiles with her excited eyes that I’m a gargoyle, that she should draw me as a gargoyle, then she notices the rainbow, the biggest and clearest one that I’ve ever seen. People are stopping to stare and take pictures of it. Northampton is without many familiar faces. I take Alice to a park bench where we watch the traffic going by. This is how I let it all go. And Krissy the night before insisted with her silly madwoman grin that I would learn eventually, I’ll always return—that no matter how I contest it, this area is home to me. I feel it growing a little in the alleyways and corners of downtown Northampton, in the familiar acquaintances, so just as Holyoke Community College is a place that I’ll always smile back upon, I suppose also is Northampton. Alice tonight made a point of not looking away when a stranger made eye contact. This caused him to trip over his chair and the two of us laughed. She and the sad weight of the emotional archives she ports—she wields power with responsibility but you know Cyclops from the X-Men, everywhere he looks he shoots beams of energy unless he wears special shades? Yeah. That’s the sort of understanding that I like in my friendships. I feel a compulsion to leave immediately. 107 Looking at the mountain, turning the wheels around curves, approximately five miles above the speed limit. That realization—I’m going over this mountain. And wanting to stop, to touch the different elevations, the slant of the earth, to see where and how the rocks and leaves find their rest. These nights have become great, the fine folks showing up to Fire &amp; Water, and when I want to use the restroom it usually takes me about five minutes, because there’s always someone I want to talk to, some wondrous eyes. Alice in her business suit, at her house she thought she’d locked her briefcase with no understanding of how to unlock it. She’s getting her work up and running as a photographer, lots of projections and hopes and a business license. Charlie and Harvey and the five cats that live with them not knowing where they’ll have to live in four days. Julia H. showing up on her own, gleeful that her car is back on the road. Tina, saving herself for a DJ she has met. Playing chess with Mocha and losing, which is okay since the last time I played chess was on Haight St. in San Francisco with V. in the first days of January 2000 and before that, with my uncle at the age of 12. Meeting Natasha, who is hidden beneath a tan cowboy hat. She cries when her friend tells her some bad news. I sit down next to her and say, “Vent,” so she does. Asking Alix if she really would want to come westward with me, she looks up from behind the eyeglasses she wears simply for fashion and says, “Sure!” Cassie, who’s already said that she definitely wants to join me, comes by, as usual carrying around the amenities to support her homeless lifestyle. I know not to rely on anyone’s accompaniment for this journey, as much as I might hope for it. Nashville Brian, also soon to be homeless, sitting at the piano and playing. Fire &amp; Water Ben sets up a microphone for it, has me set up the mixer, puts out the collection truck. People pass around the truck for the “Feed Brian Fund”. He takes poems from Mocha and Alice, impressively turning them into improvised blues and classical songs. In the car with Alice and Robyn, driving Nashville Brian back to the UMass frat house where he’s staying, he says he’s feeling paranoid, that the emotions behind particular words spoken keep resonating in his head, that he’s afraid everyone in the car is angry at him. Dropping the sleepy Alice off, driving through the complex winding adventurous streets of Springfield before driving all the way back to where we came from in Northampton. We’re just taking a cigarette break before we hop in our respective cars to go back to Robyn’s. A few folks are still lingering outside Fire &amp; Water. Alix reads us a poem about high school. I argue against a statement she makes that 95% of people are so shallow as not to be worth listening to. Rather than admit that I’m right, she uses the fact that she has had a little to drink as an excuse. I tell her that I don’t buy it. At Robyn’s, lengthy cuddles shared between the two of us, with interspersed asides on the nature of reality. I talk about the essences of direct action and feeling which reside primarily in the future spilling over into our present, and how balance can be found between the transcendental quality of these forces and the contained and predictable quality of the more mundane forces each of us focuses into our narrative. “Does that make any sense?” I ask her. “Actually, that’s something I’ve been starting to think about in the past couple days,” she says. “When you’ve moved on, I want to be a sentence in your life story,” she tells me, “Just one sentence. That’s all that I ask. ” 108 I showed up to work at Nancy’s today and was told that I was fired for my no call, no show on Monday. I work 6-10 tomorrow night at Electronics Boutique. I plan for this to be my final night there. After this, with what money I’ve saved plus my check for the past two weeks at Nancy’s, I will let myself go again. 109 I missed out on all the plans I made, dazed and sleepless, to do last minute things, so I drove to Vermont and Connecticut and saw some more people for the last time until…? “Forever” too long, world too small. On the roof of Fire &amp; Water, I look over the town: “Catch ya later. The moon calls,” when I look up and of course I realize that I’ll be leaving as the full moon is beginning its reign and I’ve always felt free, before, but the truth is that I’m leaving everything for nothing because I’ve driven far down a dead-end street, beautiful scenery but too cold to stay, and I’ve got to keep moving, moving. Otto, a big ol’ dog who walks with his owner through Northampton, kissing me to submission with his giant tongue, legs on either side of my torso as I squirm on the ground. To some I must apologize. There is love, I leave love, but I just have to hop that bus and I’ll deal with it when it comes to me. This is a dark old road. It’s in the middle of nowhere, wooded with hundred year old street signs. "

    "body": "97 The three of us lie in grass, by a swingset. We watch twinkling stars. The tops of our heads touch, so that our bodies are positioned like petals of a flower or blades of an electric fan. Mick tells his favorite story about the time he spent in Geneva, Switzerland. I’ve heard it before, I’ve heard it many times before; but for Robyn’s sake, I let him continue. Western Massachusetts. I know that Mick’s not long for this area, that I’m not long for this area, that Robyn, whom I’ve just met, is new to this area. I know that there’s nothing to hold onto. We laugh, smoke cigarettes, and move on. Late into the night, I visit Robyn’s house. Scribbled words on post-it notes cover squares of the wall to the side of her bed. She tells me that these are a work of art which will take her a long time to complete. I tell her my story of the past few months. She trusts me, but she is afraid of my life. She tells me this. 98 Robyn leaves her pack of American Spirits on a grassy hill by a parking lot in Northampton while we make the journey north to the Whately Diner. We return to find them unharmed. We talk about energy, relaxation, reincarnation, and telekinesis. We talk about the fates and what we think their motivations might be. We talk about the spirits we’ve known, and why we do or do not feel safe talking about them. “Where do spirits go when they disappear?” I ask. “I don’t know. They go to love, I suppose. ” We talk about this universe and how proximal or distal we think it is. “It can’t be that proximal,” she says, “Or we’d just use magic openly. It wouldn’t be a problem. ” “It can’t be that distal,” I smile, “Or we wouldn’t be able to have this conversation. ” 99 Scented candles are lit around my apartment. I’ve taken Alice here partially due to a lack of ideas, and partially because I’m looking to reclaim this space as my own. It should feel like a home to me, but it’s grown all the more unwelcoming since my and Tina’s dissolution. Alice’s ear has been supportive; over the past weeks, we’ve become close friends. I imagine that her presence will help. We sit in the Coalescence Room—also known as the living room. Over the course of an hour, she explains to me her history of abuse. I clutch a red candle with both hands. “I don’t know if you want to hear this part,” she says, “It’s not easy to hear. ” “You lived it. The least I can do as a friend is to hear it,” i respond. She finishes. I offer her the candle. Carefully, she drips its hot wax along the length of her upper arm. “Sometimes I can make really nice designs,” she says, “this would make a really good photograph. ” She falls asleep on me. I join her in dozing off for several minutes before I wake back up. I use the bathroom. When I return she’s lying on the couch, fading in and out of consciousness. I set a pillow under her head and a blanket around her, then go to sleep on my bed. It’s a good sleep. 100 The progression of thoughts in my mind as I smoke the first cigarette of the morning, reconstructed after the fact: I feel icky this morning. What should I do? I need something to drink. I have soda. I always drink soda. Soda won’t help my physical problems. Juice would be good. But I don’t have any juice. I don’t want to go out and buy some, I feel too yucky. I could go downstairs and take some from my mom. I hate doing that. And I’d have to remember where I put the keys. I’ll have a cigarette. Great, I think to myself that I’m feeling awful, so I’ll have a cigarette. I sure treat myself well. Mmm, cigarette. Let’s see, what do I have to do today? Picnic. I have to pick up Julia. She waxes her eyebrows and tans. Getting to talk to her makes me think about how few frontiers there are left in understanding people. I have to figure out when I’m picking up Alice, too. “I have been to Paris, I have been to Rome, I have gone to Milan and I am all alone”: Karl at Nancy’s never stops playing Counting Crows while he’s there. But I’ve always been in the United States. Maybe it’s this country that’s the problem. Henry Miller thought that America was the saddest place in the world. What’s with the random guy who always says, “Henry Miller!” when he sees me on the street, then walks off with no explanation? Okay, I’ve finished my cigarette. What now? 101 The afternoon, outside the mall with Marie, smoking cigarettes and chatting. She’s on break from her job at Charlotte Russe. I just left work at Nancy’s Café. She: “Now, Chinese restaurants, right? Especially the Hu Ke Lau. Which is technically Polynesian, but the point stands. Notorious—notorious! for serving alcohol to underage kids. Now, I’m at the counter, and I buy a pack of cigarettes. And the guy behind the counter asks for I. D. , so I pull out my learner’s permit, and since I know that’s not plastic, also my credit card, which is there, proof that I’m eighteen, I need to be eighteen to have this, here it is. He doesn’t sell me the pack of cigarettes. Never mind that there’s a table of what looks obviously to be a table of sixteen year old girls drinking white zinfandel right behind me. But okay, okay. That didn’t even bother me, I didn’t get the pack of cigarettes, okay. But why are they drinking white zinfandel at sixteen? That’s an old lady drink! That’s your great-aunts getting together at a wedding reception and getting trashed!” I: “But at least it wasn’t beer. You have to give them credit for having wine instead of beer. ” She: “This is true. Wine, wine is a good drink. I would rather see them drinking wine than beer. But rather than wine, I would much rather see them drinking hard liquor. When I was sixteen, it was just, bring on the shots of tequila. At sixteen, they should just be saying, ‘Bring me a big jug with Xs on it. Can you get me that? And afterwards, I’ll make some music with it. ’” I: “See, this is what’s wrong with kids these days. As much as we might try and push kids in the right direction, trying to get them to appreciate the beauty of jugs, I mean, specifically targeting kids—Emmett Otter, for instance! They don’t appreciate the beauty in that. ” She: “They just don’t understand. ” I: “This country is going to hell in a hand-basket. Kids these days are just too busy shooting up smack, having sex with strangers, and not smoking cigarettes to appreciate the finer things in life. ” A woman sitting several feet away from us giggles the whole time. 102 Friends of me should be aware that I will be gone within five weeks. 103 Tuesday, I adventure with Scientist Jen. Through the night. After driving by to drop a walkman in the mailbox of her parents’ house so her brother can borrow it, going to the Dunkin Donuts in Feeding Hills, finding that the lobby is closed, getting the employee on shift to open the back door, having him ask us what we want but going to the drive-thru just to save the awkwardness of being special. Sitting in front of one of the closed stores at the stopping center to drink our coffees, talking, having not one but two police cruisers pull up to ask what we’re doing, saying we’re just drinking coffee and surprisingly not being told to relocate. Driving around, stopping at a rest area on Interstate 91 it’s dark and I spin my lit cigarette in circles. One truck backs up slowly in a straight line through the rest area. We wonder what it’s doing. We go to the lake at Smith College, looking across at the sign that says, “Smith 2001”. A man whistles, jumps in, swims across the lake and back. Jen and I talk about deep, dark secrets, because that’s the topic that I bring up. Looking at trees, talking about trees, street signs, a long hug. As I always say, I never let go first, why would I let go? The Whately Diner, where everyone’s run to after the club. Charlie saying I haven’t been a good friend. My exhaling after everyone leaves, asking Kelly the Waitress a philosophical question while she cleans a table and “Imagine” plays on the jukebox. On Jen’s steps, hearing more stories of conflict and pain and absorbing like I always absorb while the rain falls. Wednesday, canceling plans with Conor, Alice, Julia H. , and Kestrel for Fire &amp; Water because I want to sleep… but then not being able to sleep and going on my own. Feeling sad. Thursday, nothing. Friday, coffee with Barry at his apartment, Graff coming in and venting about how everyone’s crazy, my making silly comments to make them smile, knowing that when you need to make someone smile is when you hardly have any power at all, running to the other room when I hear on the television the old public service announcement for the Homeless National Switchboard, the one with the song that goes, “When times get rough, you can fall back on us. Don’t give up, please don’t give up…” because as a small child I already had been able to see a piece of myself in that scared, homeless adolescent girl. Saturday, Patrick coming over, and us heading to Fire &amp; Water. Getting a coffee and a cappuccino, sipping alternately, Alice shows up with a friend whose name I already forget. I jump around outside singing the “Say how do you do and shake hands” song from Disney’s Alice in Wonderland while others clap in time. Meeting Alix, trying on her glasses and deciding that I then became her. Watching the game of chess excitedly, asking Alice and her friend how the conversation was going, and when they said it wasn’t very interesting saying, “Okay, I’m going to throw down a subject and you’ll talk about it and it’ll be interesting. Bondage! Discuss,” but that not working and changing the subject to flowers and having it work out. After the Eric Underwood Band is finished playing, I point as the cellist walks to the bathroom and exclaim, “Cellist!” The guy who’s always at Fire &amp; Water whose name I forget and I both get to play her cello. Rage Against the Machine plays over the speakers; seeing strangers dancing wildly in the middle of the closing down café to it, I join in, then pull the little drums off the wall and play them along with Fire &amp; Water Ben (an employee there) to the beat of the music, Pepper (the other employee working that night) kicking everyone out early. Talking with Alix outside about writing, looking through a notebook in her bag while she waits for Fire &amp; Water Ben to get out, she and Patrick talking about Radiohead, Fire &amp; Water Ben getting out and then pulling out a big tackle box and proudly explaining the names of each lure, giving Patrick the “Bass Assassinator”. Going to the Whately Diner, where it appears that all of the staff are new and nothing is going right. I talk to Patrick through my sad smiling reminiscence about the past, present, future, love—things it’s usually tough for me to say. 104 Cuddling with Scientist Jen on the roof of Fire &amp; Water. She: “Tell me the meaning of life. ” (Turned around, of course, because I always ask people the meaning of life. ) I: “Cows. Ask me again. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Grazing. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Manure. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Carrots. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Weight loss. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Seventeen magazine. ” “What’s the meaning of life?” “Anorexia. ” And on and on, until: “What’s the meaning of life?” And then we kiss. After coming down from the roof, finding Robyn and Tina being joyful on the streets, being taken along to the housing complex where someone we know is staying. The apartment buzzers don’t work past 11 PM so Tina says “stand back” and forcibly yanks the door open. We walk through the long bland hallways and up stairs, but he isn’t home. Robyn covering her eyes and letting us lead her as we walk—like a trust game. 105 In the afternoon I wake up next to Scientist Jen. It’s Memorial Day. We go to the Village Commons in South Hadley, thinking to eat at Tailgate Picnic or somesuch, forgetting that many places are not open on holidays. We end up eating at the Holyoke Mall. We pick up Julia H. , who’s made the name “Levi” out of wire, hung on a string. I wear it around my neck all night. She says it’s embarrassing and for me not to tell people that she made it; I ignore this and give her proper credit with all due enthusiasm. Drop off Jen, go to Fire &amp; Water. Star, the owner, is sitting outside and looking at a real estate catalog. The air is damp, but the sky is not dark. I ask whether it hailed and thundered here in Northampton like it did in Chicopee. He says yes and compares the current rain to the weather in the Pacific Northwest. I mention Portland. He says good things about it and adds that there’s a big connection between this area and there. I practice before the open stage begins on a hill a couple streets down, while children run about and play. I sit on the dumpster next to a ska girl from NYC named Rachael. I play her guitar. Nathan and Tarah say hello. Patrick shows up with his guitarist, whom I haven’t met before. My name is called early, in the middle of my buying coffee. For the second week in a row I’m unprepared as I run up to the performance space: “Uh, wait, where’d I put my guitar? Oh, there it is. And my pick, um?” Someone hands me a pick. I play “The Mote Divine” and “Pieces”. I get lots of happy congratulations; Harvey asks me why I don’t do more with my music, saying that I “could actually be big”. Star tells me that I need new strings on my guitar. It’s a good night. One guy plays some form of bagpipes, Tarah’s sister plays and is exceptionally good, a guy sings a song about falling in love with a Denny’s waitress. Someone goes up, before anything else says that she’s new to the area and wants to form a ska band, plays guitar for a song, then sings some a capella jazz but apparently loses it, ending with “ba da ba ba da baaa… shit!” She vanishes soon after. Star finishes up the night by playing a couple songs and telling everyone that he’s trying to sell Fire &amp; Water. Krissy drives by and stops to say hello to me, just back from the Dracula’s Ball in Philadelphia. I talk with Harvey. Cassie, a friendly hippie townie, comes out from the café. I ask her if she’s still going to Portland, because she’d mentioned plans for an all-girl road trip to there. She says she’s not sure, that Georgia’s a possibility too, that she only knows she needs to get out of the area. I tell her that I’m going. She says she wants to come, that she’d be able to afford busing it with me. Julia H. condemns my excessive smoking. I mumble about how it replaces things like feeling comforted, connected, etc. She offers to let me rest my head on her. After about thirty seconds of my attempts at relaxation, she says, “Do you feel connected yet?” and I say, “Not quite”, sit up, and re-light my cigarette. Tina takes me aside and talks. “Even though I know my life is filled with all these romantic happenings and stuff, I still feel lonely,” she says. “But I’m feeling comfortable around you again—like, right now I don’t feel tense talking to you,” she says. “I feel tense talking to you right now. Because I have to pee,” I respond. I give her a small hug. She clutches onto me and starts crying. Before the night is over I talk a little more with Julia. I give her the basics of a guitar lesson. I tell some of the story of V. , then explain that I’m going to stay with her and her boyfriend in Portland. “That’s pretty intense,” she says. “Nah,” I say. We leave when Fire &amp; Water Ben leaves. I drive Julia home as she talks about relationships. I come back to my apartment and look around it. 106 A small space where I like to sit in the outside wall of Barnes &amp; Noble, because most people couldn’t sit there—my combination of being small and dexterous with a little butt letting me sit there (like a windowsill with no window)—and Alice is there. She smiles with her excited eyes that I’m a gargoyle, that she should draw me as a gargoyle, then she notices the rainbow, the biggest and clearest one that I’ve ever seen. People are stopping to stare and take pictures of it. Northampton is without many familiar faces. I take Alice to a park bench where we watch the traffic going by. This is how I let it all go. And Krissy the night before insisted with her silly madwoman grin that I would learn eventually, I’ll always return—that no matter how I contest it, this area is home to me. I feel it growing a little in the alleyways and corners of downtown Northampton, in the familiar acquaintances, so just as Holyoke Community College is a place that I’ll always smile back upon, I suppose also is Northampton. Alice tonight made a point of not looking away when a stranger made eye contact. This caused him to trip over his chair and the two of us laughed. She and the sad weight of the emotional archives she ports—she wields power with responsibility but you know Cyclops from the X-Men, everywhere he looks he shoots beams of energy unless he wears special shades? Yeah. That’s the sort of understanding that I like in my friendships. I feel a compulsion to leave immediately. "

    "body": "1 I held Mandy’s hand at the club. June had approached by then, talking with her. I felt good about this, but I still didn’t know much about June. I just knew that I liked the way Mandy spoke about her. At the bar, where I stayed for most of the night, it was not sex in the air but it was the morning after in the air, or perhaps the period immediately after, because although you’re staying the night and it’s late you’re inclined to lie there on the bed, clothes strewn here and there, undergarments in close proximity because you were all in street clothes and it was just something that happened, it was sex like you had in high school, or about which you fantasized in high school, either because you needed to fantasize about it or because you wanted to, because the people you might have sex with were just people, right? Wearing weirdo socks, getting their hair messed up, the whole works. Later in the night, an Adam would call me a sexy bitch and say that he wanted me. I would then say, “You’re lying, and I’m offended by that statement. ” He would apologize and give me a hug. On a night of me, what they call a boy, with what they call girls around me, there’s a strange sort of humility that works when nothing else seems to. I don’t fix what’s not broken. I sit here and ramble. 2 I grew more and more sensitive to Bailey, starting to become nervous, like having a crush, and meanwhile Millie was there. The way Millie combs her hair makes it seem so straight, as it kind of frames her face. She had called things off with both the husband and wife. She talked about it. She had mentioned several times, “You’re like the only one I met and didn’t kiss, at the club, the night I met you. ” Tonight she scolds me for not drinking wine, since I got her started on drinking wine at the club. 3 I had a dream of sitting on the steps of the Northampton City Hall with a stranger—someone I didn’t recognize. Everything was dark except for the concrete, which seemed to be lit from above. She held me and I cried. Then I was in a bedroom with the woman. My fingers moved inside her. She was quickly overcome with pleasure… …or so it seemed… …until she started shoving me, staring me down. She asked, “Can I beat you up?” I said, “What?” She said, “I want to rough you up. ” She held me down. “No,” I said. “What? I can’t hear you. Why are you mumbling?” “Let’s stop. ” “Why?” Her eyes changing, now looking at me the way a rich person looks at a poor person she wants to help with as little effort as possible. “What’s wrong?” 4 After we dropped off Mandy so that she could throw up from nausea, I drove Bailey back to Smith College. I kept fidgeting nervously, looking at her, hiding my face and smiling. 5 (Dreams are the truth, and life is the proof. ) 6 At the same coffee shop. There are puffy, happy clouds in the sky. If I were here with a friend we might wander the Village Commons and breathe in fresh air, trying to ignore the sound of so many departing war planes on this clear-for-a-change day. I count on both hands the laptop computers I see. On the way home from the goth function, in Holyoke, coming down from a ramp, I ran up over the curb slightly, as I only slowed down somewhat, going through that red light which I don’t think counts as a red light for right hand turns, which are legal on red in the state of Massachusetts, but anyway, then a police officer pulled me over. He said, “I’m pulling you over because you came flying off the ramp there. You were going like 60. ” (Even the nice cops exaggerate like a little sibling trying to get you in trouble. ) I had prepared my license and registration and rolled down my window by the time he reached my vehicle. “Where are you going in such a hurry?” “Home to Chicopee from Northampton. ” “Were you at a club there?” “Yeah, I was at Diva’s. ” “Right, the goth night. A couple of my friends were there. Okay, I’m just going to run your license to make sure everything’s set. ” And all was well in the world. When he came back I answered his questions about how the club had been that night. 7 Mandy wasn’t at Haymarket, which was the first place I checked. My next thought was to go a few doors down to Faces, a novelty shop. She was at the checkout counter. “How did you know to meet us here?” she asked. “I don’t know,” I shrugged. She paid for her postcards while I looked at little gift books that tell you how to be a bad grrl and articles of clothing in various animal prints. Mandy wears glasses. Her legs are very long for someone who’s not tall. If you know her, take notice of this sometime! She dresses flashily, but what’s fun is that it doesn’t seem like she’s making any statement. At least that’s my take on the matter. She just seems like she comes from an alternate reality in which fishnet stockings and flashy dresses are casual like jeans and tank tops. “We’re waiting for Bailey. ” Then Bailey showed up. (Now I’m on a bench outside, The Village Commons, still South Hadley. I just left the coffee shop and it’s a maze of stores and stairs here across from Mount Holyoke College. ) Anyway, it was very rainy, Northampton in the rain with Mandy and Bailey. I suggested the Vermont Country Deli and ate a cheese sandwich there and then we went to the Academy of Music, which has dilapidated remnants of very classy restrooms that are, like, there should be someone there with a towel for your hands but instead there are flies on the map of the London Underground that’s above the urinals. We saw Igby Goes Down. I liked it. I’ve always liked Bill Pullman, for some reason. Then to Fire &amp; Water, where I know people, lots of people, on Wednesday night. Tonight all the cigarette smokers are huddled outside of the entrance door in the small space protected from the rain, inches from each other. I go out into the rain, unemployed, for some reason thinking to myself these ongoing sad thoughts about, like, how long I might have any of what I call friends, unsure of what the point ever was of trying to overexert myself for the sake of another’s company. Ideals sparkle in my eyes like spiderwebs of light in moistened eyeglasses. But Bailey wants to go to Haymarket, away from people. We invite Mandy. She says that she’ll stay to see Maurice perform. (Now, I’m bringing it up a notch. I’m at Mount Holyoke College itself, on a picnic table. My feet are on the bench part and I’m sitting on the table part, of course, because that’s the only way picnic tables can ever seem comfortable to me. ) I talked with Bailey about people, about socializing, about judgment vs. acceptance vs. human nature. Not small talk, but not big talk—middle talk. Mandy came later, upset because she felt like she had been ignored by some of the other people at Fire &amp; Water. Then, sitting in a sheltered storefront in the darkness and the quieting streets, the three of us holding hands. And to Mandy’s, and she checks her email and we mix drinks but no one drinks more than one of them. Mandy, after checking her email, becomes very energized, although usually I would be expecting her to be falling asleep by this point. She takes her pants off and leaves them off. This is not out of the ordinary for Mandy, whose undies are often revealed for all to see. That’s just part of hanging out with her, seeing her undies. What’s more unusual is the way she flails herself about onto, into, and around Bailey and me. It’s an adorable excitement, although at times she doesn’t pay attention to exactly which body parts are bearing her weight, or otherwise how we might be… subjected to pain as a result of her adjustments. Anyway. We all cuddle for awhile, then. It’s the first time either Mandy or I have really been physically close to Bailey like this. Mandy’s roommate comes home. She stands in the doorway to Mandy’s room and it’s along the lines of, “Well, I didn’t know what I’d be coming home to!” Soon after the roommate said goodnight and went into her room, the consistent references to kissing led me to take the initiative by asking Bailey if I could kiss her. “Yes,” she said. In that “of course” voice. The kiss—knowing of Mandy’s liking Bailey, my intention was not to sustain it excessively, lest it be viewed as some type of assertion of ownership. These were soft, light kisses. Mandy said that she had been wanting to kiss Bailey all night, but that she had thought I might have been offended if she got to it first. I said, “Really? Ohhh. I don’t have any more of a… claim to the kissing of Bailey than you do!” Then she fell into a snuggle with her. Mandy said that she had felt bad for feeling oddly jealous, while she had been watching. She asked Bailey permission for a kiss, which was granted. I sat up where Mandy had been while the two of them, lying down, kissed as Bailey and I had kissed. 8 The car ride home with Bailey. Talk of how it was weird that the first time Bailey broke past certain physical boundaries with either of us it was with both of us. But it was just so obvious a time for it, we had so blatantly been up for it. Parked outside her house, I hugged her. Then I said, “And a quick peck”, leaned in for that… but it was longer than a “peck”. We kissed delicately, as before. 9 Internet materials and the DSM informed me the other night that in the past, I met the criteria for Tourette’s Syndrome, all that time of odd little tics. I said to Mandy that knowing this seemed pretty cool—I can describe my history in one respect! I taught myself to read by noticing the tendencies of phonics. But then I never wanted to stop learning how to read. I noticed more and more tendencies of not only how words were formed but how they worked together. Now I just speak another language altogether, don’t I? What sort of future do I expect to have? I feel, sometimes, like I made predictions but then lost them. I watched White Oleander last night. How this happened was that Mandy invited me along to hang out with her friend Lauren, who was going to be in town, the two of them go way back and then, “Oh, wait! she’s on your LJ friends list!” and when Lauren arrived it was with her boyfriend, but he didn’t stick around long and so the three of us got calzones and then drank beverages at the Black Sheep and then Lauren called him up (the boyfriend) again for the movies. I like being in Amherst while fashionably disheveled. I spilled V-8 on the pants I’m wearing, which Mandy let me put on because I was wearing a skirt that was tight around the waist. (Maybe if I reach some sort of middle ground between my mother and my father, I can bring disparate worlds together. ) 10 I went back to Mandy’s. I had been placing myself in her presence daily, as though I was living there, only a forty-five minute drive from my house but I hadn’t even been back home for a few days and my face was stubbly and my hair was yucky. At least the rains had let up, for a change in scenery. Did it usually rain so much in the fall? We arranged to meet June in Amherst. We met her in front of The Mercantile. She was sitting on a curb, reading. We saw her on our approach only from the back while her hair covered her face. I gave her a leaf, which stayed in her hair for a while. 11 I walked through the artificial light. It felt seductive. The supermarket was closed in the autumn night, the lights still on, the automatic doors no longer opening. The soda machines glow, advertising Coke in the way that Coke is always featured in futuristic films—as if it’s inevitable, as if every possibility of every permutation of every moment of every timeline must have Coke present wherever humans are present. A gal outside of Denny’s is laughing. With a guy, who smokes too much, she says to him. He speaks in that casual baseball cap dialect, the suburban east coast variation on it, no pauses, syllables like a drum roll, the word “like” thrown in frequently but without any sign that it’s buying time. It’s like the word “like” is just there to spare the meter, a meter that means one line is the same as the next, a meter suggesting infinity. But he’s not wearing a baseball cap. He looks like he’s read some books. Somehow he still seems confident. I go inside. There’s a coffee and water in front of me. The song playing over the speakers features piano and strings. I order bad food and look at my reflection. Of all the people I might be, in this booth, it seems so odd to be me. If I knew me, I would wonder what it must be like to be me. What it’s like to be me: And when I stopped there, not immediately within sight of where I smoked my first cigarette but just the distance of a building and some gravel from it, I lit a new cigarette. Marlboro Red today. I have no brand loyalty and switch both brand and type of cigarette with each pack I buy. Reaching the end of the five-song sampler from Tori Amos’s upcoming Scarlet’s Walk LP. “Gold Dust” was the song. I looked to the sky. I thought that I might stop to scribble thoughts—and did for a moment—but I also needed to pee. The CD ended. It only began skipping at the very end, skipping through the final several seconds and by doing this accelerates the ending. I thought to myself, “I wouldn’t choose friends over this. ” 12 Back to the story of Saturday. June pulled out tea bags from her pocket and we were granted cups of hot water at Rao’s. We sat there inside, sharing tea. Mandy spilled one of the cups, soaking my pants and rather hurting my arm. The two of them went into the restroom to try on each other’s clothes. We left the coffee shop, each wearing a coat belonging to one of the others. In the present tense, I head inside to the line at the register to ask the guy whose way of speaking I was writing about before if hey I could get a light from him. He lets me run outside to use his Zippo. I feel bad that I seemed to have a harsh opinion of the way he spoke, because he seems quite nice. Even if the fashion sense of the gal he’s with seems a little too indie for my tastes. Though I like her, too, now that she stands here and smokes a cigarette some seven feet away from me. Because she exhales in a half-laugh at something she sees inside, and her face is alive. Back to the retrospective: June and I each had an arm around Mandy. Walking the streets as night fell, I bummed a smoke from a guy outside of the tattoo shop, whom June asked some personal question I now have forgotten and we learned just a little about him that night, before we went to June’s dorm at UMass, where I chose Information Society and Vanessa-Mae from her MP3s and played some Dance Dance Revolution and Mandy took off her pants so that June could cut out a picture of the Planters mascot, Mr. Peanut, to put in the “window” in her panties. Saw an improv comedy performance of UMass’s Mission: Improvable. Then to McDonald’s. This was June’s suggestion. I was very much aware of the way my hair clumped together, unwashed now for several days. Also, I recognized that my facial hair was becoming more obvious, and I had only smoked a few cigarettes over the course of the day. (Staring at distant objects or hugging Mandy or generally doing my action without thought was my way of counteracting withdrawal. ) The employee at McDonald’s gave June her food for free. Then June paid for Mandy and me. She said that she liked how Mandy and I communicated. After June was dropped off we went to Sunderland, to Mandy’s. Not long there before I went to visit Bailey. I tend to notice Bailey’s hair before anything else… but when I met her the very first time it was her mouth and her glasses and her expressions. She led me into the closet, was showing me clothes. It was fast-paced, high-energy. She showed me a couple pictures and I saw that she keeps cigarettes in her drawer as one might keep weed and didn’t I like her new clothes? But I did. She was talking about Halloween costume ideas and then she offered me some Magic Hat beer from a jug, into a plastic cup. I had just a taste. Onto her bed and then down onto the bed, kind of, and the hug, then legs over me, then I was lying down next to her, then kisses—ferocious kisses, then softness, then lying still in relaxation before she was ready to fall asleep. 13 Marie can very rarely be found online, but on this day she messaged me to suggest I pick up her and Maurice and that we go to Denny’s. I don’t have long before I’m due to visit Moon and Colin, but I agree to Marie’s request anyway. I arrive at Maurice’s. He tells me that there’s much excitement in his house at the moment: his mom can’t find her keys, Marie’s reading in his room and he himself appears to be doing his characteristic pacing around the house. Maurice’s room. Marie’s on the bed. I haven’t seen her lately. Her hair’s tied back. She’s wearing her glasses, sitting. Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk in her hand. I plop down next to her and we hug. We talk about the upcoming show Marie and Maurice’s band, The Basement, are doing, to Marie saying, “Why does Patrick seem to turn up at every Basement show?” “He does,” adds Maurice, “But he never seems to stick around for the show. He’s just there for a bit. ” Marie turns to me as though I should be able to explain this. “Maybe he’s waiting for you to say something to him,” I suggest. “Like what?” asks Marie. “I don’t know. ‘I’m sorry, Patrick, everything was my fault’? I’m just throwing out ideas here. ” “You and I both know, Levi, that this day will never come. ” She then rather painfully relates gruesome details of what she would endure before apologizing to Patrick. Their relationship ended more than two years ago, but it still seems like a tricky issue. Marie went on about the way their relationship went downhill, about the problems they had had. “It seems like every time I get together with the two of you guys,” Maurice interjects, “You start going back and forth, bashing Patrick. ” This gives me pause. That’s not the sort of person I like to be. 14 Massachusetts is just deep forest to me. You know that the sun has risen only because it’s been light for a while now and eventually you see it peeking through the mosaic and we have buildings everywhere, drive down a slight incline to the parking lot. The next building is up the hill, get your footing and walk the dirt pathway. Watch out for the prickers. There isn’t a walkway to cross while you’re walking that section of Route 33. 15 To Northampton I went. After I remembered—late—that I was waiting at the incorrect location for Mandy, I asked a passing college student how to find the campus coffee shop. She gave me directions and I arrived. Mandy was all right, chatting with someone she knew who goes there, and she was in a confident way. I could see it. She was excited in general and conversation was weird and wonderful, for the remainder of Bailey’s shift working there. Bailey brought us free mozzarella sticks and waffle fries. Mandy, Bailey and I to the diner. Dropping off Mandy after: “You don’t have to throw up [from motion sickness] this time, do you?” I ask her. “Um, yes, actually,” so a hurried goodbye. Parking by Smith with Bailey. “Look,” I said, “You can see the moon! Through the moonroof!” I was being stupid. “How romantic,” she said. She was being smart. We made out in the car. I said, “Heh. We made out in a car. ” I drove home after saying, “Thanks for the memories” and having her reply, “Wow! Thank you! That was great” because she appreciates memories. 16 Word on the street was that today would involve the year’s first snowfall. Never mind that it’s only October, about two months before the time when this would usually happen. I heard about this while sitting at Fire &amp; Water yesterday. I had driven Maurice there for the Basement performance, parking in the special little driveway next to it (and feeling special for this reason), and to my surprise Jay and Millie were there: “I was going to call and invite you to come out with us!” Millie told me. Texas (the name by which the guy from Texas is known) was talking about how cold this weather was to him, while my coat rested beneath me. This was where the mention of snow came up, and Millie’s anecdote: she visited her father in the psych ward, and he asked, “What’s wrong with your generation? When I was your age I had a house, a spouse, two kids” and then Millie’s response: “What do we have to look forward to? We inherited the apocalypse! The best that we can do is to hone up on our scavenging skills!” I’m not sure if any snow fell. There’s a light covering of moisture on the outside tables and chairs, so there may have been flurries. Now it’s another morning at The Thirsty Mind, South Hadley, Massachusetts and another post-Haven morning, too. Another morning pondering hydration vs. caffeine withdrawal. Fiona Apple’s second album, When the Pawn… is playing. I smiled to the barista and said, “Fiona Apple!” and she smiled back without saying anything, but I thought that I read on her face, “What an insignificant thing to comment on!” I spill coffee on myself and write about this fact before I even bother to get a napkin. I need a smoke, paper. I’ll come back to you, paper. Paper ownz me. So, from Fire &amp; Water I was invited to head to the Tunnel Bar for a few drinks with Millie, Jay, and their friend Noel, once she showed up. There was time before The Basement played, so I agreed. The Tunnel Bar is a nice place, the server was kind and there was talk about the Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald playing there. The bar is an actual tunnel, long and skinny. We ordered two bottles of wine having nothing to do with each other and split them between the four of us. Maurice’s friend Amy brought her puppy to Fire &amp; Water. He was wonderful. I overheard a conversation: “It’s a benefit show coming up. I don’t really know what’s going on with it, some kids I met from Westfield are putting it on, I don’t even know any of the acts that are playing…” “I’m playing that show,” I said, amused. She gave me a couple of her organization’s zines so that I can now learn exactly what this benefit show I’m playing is a benefit for. Bailey showed up during the spoken word intro to The Basement’s set. I found stools and we sat next to each other holding hands while they played. The set was beautiful. Marie was sick but it didn’t show. She said afterward that she had just had to fake-care about it, but at the same time she said, “I don’t think we can play ‘Spider’ again for awhile,” because it’s too emotional for her to sing regularly. Bailey said that she thought the show was amazing, that it inspired her to write the first bit of poetry-not-prose she had done in awhile. Marie left quickly afterwards, to “overdose on cold medicine, probably,” Maurice said. I can’t look anybody in the eye after a musical performance, either. It was The Basement’s final show at the Fire &amp; Water Café: Fire &amp; Water is closing next month. 17 Bailey IMed and told me that she’s tense, she didn’t know how complicated things were, how intense Mandy could be, and that didn’t mean she liked her any less but Wow. So I’m meeting up with Bailey before the three of us all meet up for tonight. "

The knock on the door of the house—a house I don’t recognize, though in the dream I live there—begins very softly, then continues to increase in intensity, until I run to answer it. Two intimidating men are there. “Mr. Levi,” says one, holding out a cup of coffee for me once I open the door, “Have a coffee. We need to talk. ” The coffee is just the way I like it, I realize as I take a sip. “You continue to believe in (something). You cannot live by your (something). It’s interesting and all, but…” 19 Friday. To Bailey’s dorm house. Using the little phone by the door, dialing her extension. She came down, colorful socks on her feet, and held the door open for a bit while I bounced and said how nice a day it was outside. I was wearing new shoes. In her room. Talking about things, political concerns and exchanging opinions re: me + her + Mandy and then about the history of my love life, lying next to each other, classic position, one facing the other. There were some kisses, but mostly it was just the Talking Session we had predicted it would be. Bailey had work at Jittery’s. I wandered around town for a bit, then to Jittery’s, where Mandy was supposed to show up. Bailey made me a free mocha, I ate and read from a book about bisexuality that I’m almost finished with. By the time Bailey was finished work Mandy wasn’t there. Back to Bailey’s room. Mandy was online. She said she had had bus problems, so we drove to meet her. Mandy was dressed up when we arrived—glitter makeup and a sparkly blue dress, ready to head out, but we didn’t head out. We stayed around, the three of us sitting in a chair. They were the ones having the conversation, mostly. Mandy has been low in spirits. She’d taken a Mandy-level dose of Klonopin with codeine, which had to do with the way she went from not making eye contact when we first got there to being able to connect somewhat but still struggling like behind a waterfall but placing her head through the mist and screaming everything that she spoke. I don’t even notice anymore, really, but her clothes come off gradually. It’s spoken out loud, talk about kissing. She’s more okay with what she can see between Bailey and me, fears aren’t developing, scenarios and paranoia and What’s Going On isn’t going on. But what about the kissing? I ask, It was tough for her to see before. And it still would be, she says, but even… (that little pause, the How do I say this) other things wouldn’t be so hard for her, she’d be fine with, except the kissing. Bailey asks her to rephrase, elaborate, clarify? Mandy struggles for words, so I say, “It’s easy to deal with if it’s dirty, but not if it’s sweet. ” I felt better after a cigarette, before then not knowing what to do to Help Mandy. (I made it safely past a skunk standing by the door, just looked at it and moved calmly in the direction I was going, saying aloud, “I’m just going in. ”) Mandy said, “Let me try on your pants, Bailey” and Bailey let her, there, I had to move my leg while Bailey took off her pants, her eyes kind of gone and distant and not-really-there, Bailey tried on two of Mandy’s dresses, running off both times to the bathroom to see herself in the mirror. Bailey put her clothes back on. Mandy put a sweater on, but not buttoned up, just the bra underneath and her bottom half bare except for awkward undies. I just started to kiss Mandy’s tummy. I think Bailey and she were having a moment, then. Mandy’s eyes just kept darting to Bailey and then vaguely to me. Then Bailey was looking directly at me with her powerful eyes, and said, “That was beautiful,” and I instinctively hid, averted my gaze, like as though blushing. But I just continued the little kisses on Mandy’s body while Bailey moved forward and the two of them connected lips. The kisses to Mandy’s body incorporated touch, then, involving more territories of skin, and Bailey and I took turns kissing Mandy, not methodically, and Bailey caressed Mandy’s skin as well. The way Mandy’s muscles tensed at moments, suddenly, in response to specific touches… I know I thought She seems kinda turned on as well as Comforted, but That doesn’t speak of her mind, She is shy to speak in the moment, her comfort with Sexuality is uncertain with her until she speaks at length after the fact… but Look at the way she kisses Bailey and the way she kisses me. Is there something Bad here? We were awkward, not Confident. Not Kinky, not Dirty. We all brushed our teeth before the little kisses we’d exchanged, that we’d planned to exchange before they happened, Bailey’s suggestion that we do it quickly, heads pressed together, right there, three of us were in a bed and I did just want Mandy to know what she has, though I know she knows, want to send some offerings through the waterfall of worries and fear fear fear, and when I thought But I have something with Bailey too! I didn’t need to prove it, not there, Mandy knew, and tonight we were making her an offering, it was of Respect and Affection and we lay still, then, it was just Bailey saying to Mandy, “See? It’ll all be okay. It’s beautiful. ” Bailey ran to the living room to get her paperjournal. Mandy said to me: “I feel more strongly about Bailey than I thought I did. ” Bailey read an inspirational bit of assertion that she’d written for herself, that worry won’t help, that there’s nothing to worry about, and Mandy said, “Can I hold you to that when it’s not 1 AM and we haven’t been making out in a bed?” “Absolutely. ” 20 Bailey put on Twilight to Starlight, the second disc of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. I said, as we stood in the center of Mandy’s floor and she held me: “Bailey. I know that I kiss you, sometimes, and so I’m not supposed to say this. But I love you: you put on The Smashing Pumpkins. ” (Thanks for the memories. Let’s be here, until we’re gone, and learn our lessons. ) 21 Little goths, who appear about 13 years old, walk by. They all say hello and wave to me. 22 Newbury Comics, Newbury Street, Boston, Massachusetts. Just because I knew that I felt inexplicably compelled to interact with this stranger did not mean that I had to like it. I wasn’t feeling social. The new Tori Amos album was playing over the speakers. This was annoying me, because I was hearing it out of context. I wasn’t taking it in. The experience of it wasn’t perfect. Platinum blond hair. Dressed in white, wearing some sort of pendant around her neck. A poet, a recent BU graduate. Named Helena. I remember how she asked my name. With confidence, as though having asked this question of many people, and always in the same way. I was more skeptical than trusting, but I knew that she was part of the story: someone who gets a name. Someone who implants a bit of something into me, without my permission, but that’s okay. I impress them for a while… until I disappoint them. Or the order is reversed. Or the roles are reversed. In any case, she used the phrase, “Not so much,” in that way that Mandy does. When she first spoke to Maurice and me it was in the context of misunderstanding the subject that he and I were discussing, somewhere near the letter ‘e’ in the alphabetically filed pop/rock section of the music store. 23 “The song, “Pancake” is the best thing since sliced bread,” I said. “You like sliced bread?” she asked. “Yes, very much so. ” “Really. What’s your favorite kind of bread?” “Hm. My favorite kind. ” “Yes. Mine’s rye. ” “Well, I like baguettes. ” “Ohhh. ” 24 “I’ve exceeded my own expectations,” I said. “That’s impressive,” she said. “So now, when new things happen… when a new path opens up to me and I find new lessons to learn, I’m always amazed that I could ever make it to this level. ” I kept having to remember not to reminisce. I kept having to remember that this was a stranger in Boston and that it was a quarter past midnight. “But don’t you know, kind of, somewhere, those places where you’re going?” “I suppose… but I let myself be pretty short-sighted when it comes to how I envision my life. ” “You should try opening up to it. ” “Why?” I smile. I’m sitting on the fence. (A literal fence. ) “It’s nice here. There’s great coffee. ” “Wow, coffee? Well! Wait, no! Why are other planes of perception trying to win my favor by advertising coffee!” She remained confident. 25 “You guys can leave if you want,” said Helena, “You don’t have to stick around just for me. ” Her friend was forty-five minutes late now. I had opened my Tori CD and spilled the contents of the limited edition onto the sidewalk while a guy crossing the street sang, jingling his paper cup, asking for change. The best nation is a donation, he said. Eventually her friend, Ana (coincidentally from Northampton) arrived. We gave them both rides home. 26 Helena and I chatted online. “Have you ever met someone, and you just knew that you had to know them?” she asked me. “Yes,” I replied, “That’s how it was with you. ” “Mmmhmm. Okay. We’ll talk later. ” She quoted from the new Tori album: “We make it up as we go along,” she said, and signed off. 27 Brian, originally from Nashville, comes up to the table where I write. I do believe this marks the first time I’ve ever happened to meet someone I know here at The Thirsty Mind. As usual I try to ask him what he’s doing in yet another obscure location and as usual he just shrugs and says that he’s hanging out. My body tells me that I need to use the restroom stall, but a man vomiting into the toilet was using that space when last I checked. He sounded like he was going to be a while. 28 I walked Amherst on Halloween with my discman. I let myself get lost past little stores and awesome foliage and Well-Read people with nice hats and coats that tie at the waist. I made turns based on when I wanted to make turns and just kept walking. Mandy finished her shift at CVS. I met with her as she was leaving. She had duct tape stuck to her shoe; I helped her to get it off. She wanted to go to Greenfield, so we did. Trick-or-treaters went door-to-door at the stores, getting candy, but we gravitated toward the used book store. We were the only ones in there. She sat herself in the aisle of psychology books, thumbing through them all. I was in the philosophy section, remembering how little I know, how many pieces I might still gather. Ghosts and skeletons were everywhere. I wanted to study. 29 I had heard both a DJ announcement and the commercial for the grand opening festivities for a new gaming store, Phoenix Games, that was being opened by a fellow by an occasional Haven-goer I was acquainted with, named Whitehouse. So, I stopped by. He asked me if I was going to Capo’s that night, as it was a special Halloween night Avalon. So, I stopped by there, too. 30 Bailey’s teacup had butterflies; mine had flowers. Her tea had something to do with lemon; mine was a green tea I couldn’t remember the origin of, although part of me thought that it may have come with me to Portland and back. Bailey was staying the night. I continued the story of my love life, which I’ve been relating in installments due to my narrative verbosity and the overall complexity of the story as I understand it. She sat on my lap. Her shirt was red, buttoned, pleasing to touch. I was in black uniform—dress pants and a turtleneck, the Levi Adams costume, standard, and she looked at me, her eyes were always powerful. We lay there for awhile—mostly talking, in a cuddle. 31 I didn’t expect to fall asleep next to Bailey. My plan was to lie there only until she fell asleep. But I woke up a few hours later and she had moved from the bed to the couch—the bed was too hot, she said. She had put on pajamas. While she slept I took a brief walk to the nearby liquor store to buy cigarettes. My typing at the computer stirred Bailey awake. I drove her back to Smith College, but I would be picking her up again that evening for Mandy’s birthday party. 32 To Mandy’s party I drove Bailey and Marybeth and Magic Hat #9 and a California Merlot. (The last of which the storeowner pressured me into buying after he realized that I don’t know anything about wines. ) The house was impressively full, moreso than I had expected, although it was only about 8:30. It was the standard early-part-of-a-party-night vibe: people stood around chatting in murmurs, which were to gradually increase in volume and intensity as the alcohol consumption continued. I spoke with Marybeth a lot at first, in the way I tend to speak with silent individuals at social events—throwing forth not-too-intimidating interrogatives to whatever corner he or she happens to have been drawn to. She had read the beginning chapters to Of Triangulation and wanted to be in my writings. (Hi, Marybeth!) She had seen the Which Friend of Levi Adams are you? quiz, so I mentioned the What Should Your New Year’s Resolution Be? Quiz I had made awhile back, yes of course she’d seen it, that had been a big Internet meme, it had been everywhere. June was in Mandy’s bed, looking intimidated, kind of, but mostly just hiding. Lines drawn on her face, from the corner of her eye. Hair as always endearingly frizzed. I told her that I was in her corner. Not being cute, not talking about a literal corner. A gal who had earlier been entertaining herself by manipulating a helium balloon with her feet collected information from everyone, asking for name and sexual orientation, while I interjected, “I don’t care what my sexual orientation is, because I reserve the right to defy it!” until I caved in, and to the list of, “Straight, bisexual, bi-curious, omnisexual, sapiosexual, gay with straight tendencies” I added, “Dot asterisk” as my orientation. I was commended on my cleverness and excited by this positive reinforcement, I tried repeating my statement of cleverness to different friends until it started to feel embarrassing. By then I had been drinking enough and I was next to the chair where Bailey sat done up like Clara Bow, unlit cigarette in holder, while a white boa rested by her waist and others were with me in encircling her. Outside I sat on the fence smoking and Kurt was there, wrapping up a phone call to someone and saying, “I love you”. Almost immediately he asked for my astrological sign, which I related (Taurus, cusp Aries) and he said, “That’s a tough one,” spoke of how stubborn and empirical he’d imagine I must be. The conversation continued at a fairly rapid pace as astrology talk continued and segued into more general a talk of Conceptualization of Life and then Livejournal and Mandy and Tina. Some insinuations about angels and the fates. By that time people were leaving—although Lydia, for one, had just arrived and let it be known to everyone in the vicinity of the kitchen that They were going to add Prozac to Americans’ drinking water, They were going to turn us all into zombies. 33 People left the party quickly at around the same time until only Lydia, June, Whitehouse, Stuart, Mandy and I remained. Mandy was vomiting into the toilet. I would give her more water. (June made me promise this, while she left with Lydia. ) Stuart stood in the hallway once Mandy had moved to lie down on the bed. He was acting dramatic, saying goodbye because he wanted to walk until he sobered up. He regretted over-drinking. His words were sharp and poetic, with an intensity that can only be achieved by someone like him, who actually does not seem to be a poetic sort of person. I argued some of the benefits of his maybe just remaining inside, to the extent that I even suggested that he watch television; but he insisted he needed the release. Snow fell and covering the ground. 34 I planned to apply to Hampshire College. The deadline was approaching. I procrastinated. 35 There I was at Haven—wearing a yellow shirt that was so simple, so easy to pick randomly and to throw on over my torso, which was still, apparently, a statement (even though still, apparently, I fit in). I sat at the bar, because there were empty barstools this week. I gave Graff a hug. I ordered a glass of red wine. I ordered it the same way that I always do: I didn’t specify, didn’t say Merlot or Cabernet or anything else. This is a tradition I maintain, simply because I like to see how many people will still call me a Wine Snob. It was a night of low stress. This was odd? But. I was just a kid, with other kids ill-equipped for the easy route of assimilation, in a playground built for our kind. It had less to do with music or clothing, I’d found, and much more to do with a mindset. Haven was all too appropriate a name. The question was, where did we go from here? 36 Poets read at Fire &amp; Water and Maurice was there, in his own universe for the night, and Bailey, sitting at a table with Killer—I saw them and knew that they were here in the context of a larger day, spending time with each other. They liked each other. Killer was dressed in layers of purple and green. I pulled up a chair. After a bit of conversation Bailey excused herself to go throw up her dinner—it didn’t sit well with her. Gooselove, poet/performer and host of the open mic, said a hello to me between poets. “I see that Levi has arrived. How are you this evening?” he asked into the microphone while others in the room turned to look at me. “I’m doing well, thank you,” I responded, befuddled. Later in the evening, he stood behind me in line at the counter and said, “You’re doing weekly shows here now with your band, right?” “Well, no, actually. I’ve never played a show here,” I replied. “Oh, okay. I guess I was mistaken. ” And he fell silent. Maurice requested a ride home but continued to jump around, doing Maurice things, while I sat with Bailey and Killer. After the poets had cleared out there was dancing to tracks from Kurtis Blow Presents The History of Rap Vols. 1 + 2. Eminem was played as the night at the café drew to a close: The barista, first, felt the need to ask if anyone would be offended if it were played. Meanwhile Maurice was in a corner, stretched out across several stools, working on his slam poetry, but also mouthing the lyrics to himself. 37 I tried to call Helena. I’d left a message earlier. I got her voicemail again. “You should…” was the subject line to the last email she’d sent. “Call me,” was the body. 38 I spoke on the phone with Helena for an extended period of time. We asked each other questions. She spoke nice things about me. She teased that I should drive to see her that night. I called her bluff by searching for change to see if I could afford the toll money. She hated the word “bluff”, she said. When she described something it was almost always through a metaphor. "

Once in a while I realized that I was onstage, that I was being watched, that I was triggering thought processes, in many different minds, and so I figured, Let them see, let them discern what they will, I had no need to try to manipulate them, I had no need to coerce them into believing that some form of Music or Performance was superior to another. I just wanted to know what it meant to feel music as it exited my Self, since I knew so well how it felt to have it enter. A short film was shown after my set: destitute people in foreign streets, while Radiohead’s “Exit Music (for a Film)” played. I chose to leave, to step outside. That girl I’ve seen around, fifteen years old, with a mohawk, drunk on wine, sat in a trashcan and got her rear end stuck in it. She walked around with it there: “Let me show everyone through the window!” When I returned to the inside, words were being spoken about the KALILA organization, toward which the money raised by the concert was going. This sat better with me than the film had, since it was actually informative. 40 The other night, I was walking by a particular spot in Chicopee, and I had a memory of stopping there with V. I touched the fence, thinking, “Wow, V. once touched this fence. ” That was when I realized—the one thing everyone I’ve loved has touched is me. 41 I talked to Helena on the telephone again. She said that she felt more comfort and trust in me than in most of her friends in Boston. I was trying not to speculate too much about What might come of this. Girls. They always wanted a Relationship, she had said to me before. 42 Waking up at 4 PM, turning off the alarm and maintaining enough consciousness to know that I really should get up soon, that I really shouldn’t remain asleep. Going to Boston was the plan, so 45 minutes later when I finally crawled out of bed I made a call to Maurice and woke him up. He said to come by in about an hour. At his house in Springfield, ringing the buzzer, and through the intercom he said to come upstairs. He was still in his pajamas. A call to the guy who invited him to the event, a cigarette smoked inside, and he changed his clothes, and we left. Parked in Cambridge and took the T to South Boston. All we knew was the name of the venue and that it was five hundred feet away from a specific T stop. The venue turned out to be a restaurant, with a downstairs that tonight was designated for the poetry reading. $5 admission, while a jazz band played and, “Hey, thanks for coming, it’s great to see you here,” said the gal who greeted us at the door, from under her hat. At the bar, no smoke had filled the room just yet, though there were people present. I ordered a beer and borrowed Maurice’s call phone. I called Helena. The voice on the phone sounded excited. She was sitting outside of the restaurant, underlining passages from her book of social theory. I was excited to see her, too. She said, “I’ll be right down”, quickly, over the phone. When she arrived, I was sitting on a bar stool. I hugged her. She seemed to care little about the hug, but was far more interested in kissing my cheek. The poets had the jazz band behind them, if they so desired. Maurice performed a piece in this fashion, because In Boston, do as the Bostonians do. I sat at a table with Helena while he delivered lines into the microphone, and sometimes Helena would have sudden bursts of nervous energy and her glasses would slide down slightly, while at other moments she would be so ecstatically In Control. 43 “Do you like pain?” she asked. “Sometimes,” I replied. “Do you like being scared?” “Hm. Well…” I thought it over, “I’d say, probably not. ” “I like being scared,” she said, “And I have the feeling that I’d like to be scared with you, sometime. Not scared of you, but scared with you. ” 44 “Do you know why I like you?” she asked. It sounded rhetorical, but she waited for a response. “Well…” I paused, and then said, “Tell me anyway. ” “No! Do you know?” “I want to hear how you describe it. ” “Okay,” she said. “It’s like… there’s water, and there’s a wave, and I’m riding it and it goes up and down, and at those moments when I’m at the very peak of the wave, I get nervous for a moment, but it’s exciting too. ” “Am I the water of the wave, or am I the energy that’s causing it?” “No, no, you’re not the wave. ” “Okay. But I’m a part of the water. ” “Yes, of course. ” “Like urine in the ocean. ” “Right. ” 45 “I know that ‘we make it up as we go along’, and I like that,” she said, and then paused. “You ended that sentence with a comma,” I said. “How’d you know?” I gave her a look. “Okay. I know that ‘we make it up as we go along’ and I like that, but. I think I would like to kiss you on the lips, one day. ” “Yeah?” “One day. ” “Will you?” I asked. Her eyes dropped down, and she smiled slightly. She nodded. “Okay,” I said, “I just had to clarify. Because, though it would be an interesting story to hear if just, one day, just for that moment you were going to be lying in bed thinking, ‘I’d like to kiss Levi’, but I wasn’t going to be there so it wouldn’t happen, then it wouldn’t have as large an effect on my life. ” “Wouldn’t it?” 46 The ride home. “So what’s new with you?” asked Maurice, after turning off the radio in the car. We were on the Massachusetts Turnpike. “Oh. Hmm… not too much, I don’t think,” was the only sort of reply I could think of at the moment. “Are you no longer involved in the ‘triangle’ with Bailey and Mandy? Did that fall through?” “Well. Bailey… wants to be on more a ‘just friends’ sort of basis with Mandy. That’s all. ” I nodded after finishing the last statement, as if to say that it should be the final word on the subject. We rode in silence, then. 47 I was speaking with someone. It may have been Killer, may have been that moment when Bailey left us standing, because she was off to dance under the flashing lights of the club, and Killer and I were there and we were still talking and I still was thinking of Boys. It may have been that time, though we didn’t much know what to say and I stared into the distance, taking in the movement of beings in the dark as a sort of moving photograph, when I saw a figure walking slowly and uncertainly, and it looked like… could it be? But it was, Jonny. “Wow!” I said, “Hello!’ and I shook his hand. He shrugged a lot in that despondent way he does sometimes, dressed up flashily but showing no excitement. He was struggling after his breakup with Alice. “This is new music from Tori Amos,” said DJ Penelope through the P. A. as the opening chords of “A Sorta Fairytale” began. Mandy had arrived. I hadn’t seen her for some time. I had sat down to chat with her on a couch, but upon hearing Tori I asked for her to hold my cigarettes, ID, etc. (from my shirt pocket, since I was wearing a pocketless skirt) and I had a new Tori song to dance to—I go wild when I dance to Tori—and midway through, Bailey joined me, dancing nearby. After the song, we hugged and she said, “That was beautiful. ” Then it was Mandy, Bailey, Killer and me on the couch. We were in a cozy cuddle. Killer had to leave—I think to get his ride home—and I had to find an ashtray, and when I returned from extinguishing my cigarette I could see that Mandy and Bailey were in a serious talk. Yes, it was the talk that Bailey had been planning to have with Mandy. This was shortly before the traditional final song, which was the same every week—”Voices Carry” by Til Tuesday. 48 After I had eaten some food at Denny’s the car wouldn’t start, and there I was, it was like 3 AM, so I walked up to the table of remaining goths and asked if anyone knew anything about cars. Two folks responded quickly, like Batman to the bat-signal. They checked under the hood, but to no avail, so finally I had to call home. 49 And when I awoke, I realized I had like twenty-two hours until my show at Capo’s Coffee Café. Was I going to apply to Hampshire? The deadline was the next day. But okay, I was determined to write the 3-5 page analytic essay for the application. So I started work on it, comparing sixteenth century religious conflict in France to contemporary assumptions about gender and sexuality, for some reason? I worked on the essay into the morning, until I realized that I would need a recommendation from a previous professor—a little too much for me to squeeze into my day. So, I would apply for the Fall semester instead, I figured. I slept for about three hours. 50 My performance was better than it had been the previous week at Flywheel. Again the crowd for me was small. Social Worker Michelle sat up front, right by the stage. It was nice to have such good friends be the crowd. 51 Tori Amos concert. Expensive merchandise. The Oakdale Theater, Wallingford, Connecticut. The opening act, Howie Day, was playing. Mandy, her friend, and I all had separate seats. The two of them went to sit, I wanted to wander around. I ran into six or seven people I knew, and chatted with other strangers as well, effectively treating this like a social event while the opening act played. My seat was behind a couple, who held each other and kissed for most of the set’s duration. It punctuated certain points of the show quite nicely. 52 The ride home was long. I didn’t talk much. “You know that I’m sitting in the front seat only because of my motion sickness, right?” asked Mandy. “Oh, I hadn’t thought about it, actually,” I said, “I forgot that things like this often have hierarchical undertones. ” “Oh yes, they usually do. ” “Well, you know. The only way to fight against something that’s imaginary is not to think of it. ” 53 I had slept for twelve hours when Helena called. Helena on the phone has me remembering the beauty of lying on the floor, the sound of breath into the phone, and talking over distance, knowing what she sounds like right at that moment, I’m almost there with her, but not… so it’s like I’m living that other part of myself again, everything sounds so romantically challenging. I have her therapist’s approval, he says that she should find someone who can Tie with her, if she’s so tired of Winning. And she’s written words that involve me, read them to the class, how I touched her hair and she pulled away and we talked about Touch, and I don’t even know what to say, but She wasn’t raised with touch, was raised with Strength, she doesn’t understand, she says. 54 Being In Love with one person, by my definition, does naturally prioritize, both parties hold the other as more important than… at least close to… anything else… but such a love can also transcend time, and the ability to be with this person, too… and such a small number of people know this, only want to, only want to craft In Love like an artisan, I think the state of being In Love will best be thought of as an exception that might one day prove all other rules as correct but for once inconsequential, because In Love will be In Love and they will all want to be In Love and they will sing about being In Love In Love In Love. 55 Lowell, Massachusetts. Another Tori Amos concert. Mandy and Bailey took their seats while I left to track down Helena. I had the location of her seat, written down on a piece of paper in my wallet. She called out to me while I was making my way slowly down the stairs, bending over to check the faded row numbers on the ends of the seats. Helena’s face always looked like a smile to me, even though she wasn’t a smiley person. Concertgoers squeezed past me as they wanted to their seats, with their Superpretzels and cans of beer. 56 “So are you coming to visit me on Thursday?” Helena asked. “Yeah!” I replied. “Yeah? How?” she said, as though expecting that I had formulated a plan. I shrugged. 57 While Mandy was gone to the restroom, just before the start of the show, Bailey’s head on my shoulder. My kiss on her forehead, and then, “Taste my alcohol breath,” and a kiss on the mouth. I was sipping from a plastic cup full of wine, which I had purchased for too much money. 58 Music came through the speakers. The blue curtain opened to reveal the band members between wisps of smoke. There was the smell of sage. The singer/songwriter/pianist danced her way onto the stage to the sound of an audience clapping and sending its shouts of “Woo!” like gifts. I thought about V. Would I ever see her again? Maybe I really was meant only to be “the dream floating (lost) since the beginning of time”, as she once wrote that I was. But she had felt so important to my life. Would the final chapter really never be written? Or had the final page been present in every page of the book itself? If a spirit could accelerate to the speed of love, maybe it could transcend time… and, maybe, then, all that ever could be would be illuminated by this spirit. Maybe, then, we would call this spirit “life”. 59 The van belonged to Smith College. Figuring out the logistics of our trip had been a challenge, but the acquisition of this vehicle had been part of the solution. I pulled open the sliding door and exited, with Mandy. At her apartment. Sunderland, Massachusetts. The sky was still in a dreary sort of way, as I said my goodbyes. Mandy was tired. Inside, she unceremoniously stripped her clothes off to change into pajamas: “If I’ve started to sleep in the car, there’s no stopping me once I get home. ” 60 I could use my mother’s car for the day, to drop off employment applications. I drove her to her place of employment—Bernie’s Dining Depot, Chicopee, Massachusetts—and I stayed there for a while, although the restaurant hadn’t yet opened. My mother had been working here for well over 15 years, now. "

    "body": "61 I didn’t have the money to visit Boston, but I had a credit card. Maybe if I searched for a job before leaving that would make up for it. 62 I thought Chicken McNugget meals only came with 6 pieces… but they were up to 10, now. They must have figured Americans weren’t getting enough McNuggets in their diet. It was like how their value meals never used to come in different sizes: “Large” and “Super Size” had been added very recently in the grand scheme of the Long and Illustrious history of McDonald’s. I even could remember a time before those value meals. (A similar progression had been the change in size of a typical soda, from 12 oz. to 16 oz. to 20 oz. , in little over ten years. ) I was at a rest stop on the Massachusetts Turnpike. My chest hurt—it was my lungs, probably—and I wanted another cigarette. The employee of the “All Natural Ben &amp; Jerry’s Vermont’s Finest” stand wore a cow print apron and did not appear to be proud of this fact. I click-clacked a pen from the “UMASS Student Government Assoc Working for Students”, silently comparing myself to Chicken McNuggets. The fog outside was, without a doubt, dangerous, and yet I was driving into Boston, because I wanted to sleep next to Helena. Because I wanted to see where this Story would go. 63 I arrived in Boston with little trouble. As soon as I exited the highway I was lost. This was not unexpected. I found a parking spot close to the New England Medical Center and called Helena from a pay phone. Oh, I was right down the street from her! So she walked to meet me and I was sitting, reading, peaceful. Then we walked. I love the walks of Boston. I saw grass when I looked in one direction, but skyscrapers when I looked in another, it was all so familiar and yet uncommon, on the Common. Her friend at the Tori Amos show had liked me, just as her other friend had liked me, and I wondered if I might be better off doing something with all this Like, but I still didn’t understand it. How was my drama? It was okay, I said. And she had to go to a meeting. A literary group. To read a piece of hers. And I went to Cheers. I had really liked Cheers, the television series. The actual establishment was smaller, more congested. It was early, so not too crowded. I wrote into my notebook while seated at the bar, but I didn’t have much to drain from myself (except, eventually, for a glass of beer). 64 Public garden. Founded 1837. Even the ducks act like Bostonians, and it seems so beautiful when two of them leave the congregation—a gathering of ducks, each spaced far apart from each other, staring at nothing—to pursue their separate path, and these two, even, keep their distance while they leave, even though they leave simultaneously. 65 Starbucks Coffee. Helena’s waiting by the time I make it there. Her face, and the bounce of her hair. From the sidewalk I see her. She descends the steps from the door. She moves, outside, along the sidewalk, at perhaps even more frantic a pace than I. In the city, as a stranger, one would not see her, only feel her for a moment, like a needle for vaccination. Around corners, the walking, like me it’s nothing for her to cross any number of city blocks before the thought of crossing city blocks crosses the mind, only moving forward and replacing complaint with moving forward, and to her apartment. An elevator ride, I’m under her control, she knows where she’s going, I’m not leaving a trail of psychic breadcrumbs, I’m just along for the ride. 66 What she had was really a living room converted to a bedroom. A curtain separated it from the rest of the apartment. A proper bedroom was designated for her roommate, who Was never there, who usually preferred to stay at her boyfriend’s place. From Helena’s window a view of the parking lot, some tall buildings, and pedestrians. The sill, just above the height of the bed, and it stretched to the ceiling. I must still have been young and impressionable, if I so very much did not want to leave, already, ever—if my life back in western Massachusetts seemed like such weary, fruitless monotony from here. The Pioneer Valley may have felt like Home when last I was away, when I had thought of all my friends there… but small towns and suburbia were painful, and I was twenty-one years old, and there was fire in me. Again and again. I could not bear it for much longer, I thought, again. She opened her window and we each had a cigarette, exhaling outward, into the night, stocking-footed on her bed. Every now and then she changed the music that played. 67 It was at a random moment, I know, that she kissed me. We had almost kissed early, thoughtlessly, we both knew it, and our faces had stopped just short of lips upon lips. It was mid-conversation when she, sitting over me as I lay down, moved in for the attack. Her lips were strong, and our moments were huge, and each kiss seemed to require a change in position, a movement of the head, a turn in this way or in that way, as though together we were a rifle firing something invisible, recoiling as a single entity. Hers was another body to touch, someone else to join me in a state of being that could be more tolerable than that which my upbringing had instilled in me as Reality. But I didn’t need her as just a body, I didn’t want just a body. My defenses had been up, but then they had been broken down by the truth of the situation, that hers seemed a comparably sophisticated web I wished to rest on the corner of. Quite obviously I was not lacking in the area of lovers. I hadn’t invested anything in the idea of How Many, nor did I want to. I was just experiencing a temporary Way which praised a liberation of the self, which knew no evil other than the Control of others, but since liberation meant freedom to communicate, and since, then, communication became influence, and influence became control, I knew that all Liberation was doomed to result in a paradox of ethics, unless I shackled myself when I found that I enjoyed my freedom a little too much. 68 Hours passed by, just the way I liked it, Who Knew what we were doing or why, except that our bodies remained in close proximity to each other. Of course our attraction was like that of refrigerator magnets to each other: there was no consistency to our mood or intent, only a consistency to our physical alignment, intertwined; that, whatever we were saying or doing, we were together in this moment. 69 The South Street Diner. 2:30 AM. A cold rain outside, unpleasant, like exploding baby peas hitting your forehead. But Helena didn’t complain much, nor did I. A grilled cheese sandwich and fries, and a mixture of faces in this establishment but mostly post-bar-scene. “What will you tell Mandy?” she asked. “About what?” “About… this…” and she pointed to herself, and then to me. I tried to explain Mandy. My feelings for her. I haven’t been able to state these feelings effectively, ever—not even to you, paper—but I came close, in this diner, while girls with curious hair took orders and told newcomers It’d be a five minute wait. And I thought, maybe, that Helena understood, sometimes. 70 I slept for three hours before I crawled out of bed. We had remained in the same position of embrace for the entire length of this sleep. The sun had risen, and through the window I saw women with plastic bags, city workmen, and billows of smoke or steam whose origin I never thought to trace. 71 She would be going to Northampton that night. A two hour drive away. This was not only for the sake of seeing me. It had already been planned before the two of us met. It was another little synchronicity. 72 Starbucks, somewhere in downtown Boston. Just a desire for coffee in the morning, just following seagulls, because I knew it couldn’t be too long before I found a Starbucks, in an area like this. A man with a well-trimmed, graying beard, wearing glasses, sitting next to me. “Journal?” he asks. “Yeah,” I say. He talks about himself: he always liked to write and has read lots of books about writing but never got serious enough, and You gotta write, Is what it comes down to. After he leaves, his seat stays empty. A woman with dangly earrings is still seated next to me on the other side. More strangers pass by—people people, social creatures, so many of them, composing and inhabiting each other. People people people people people people people people people people people, people! I would like to click on so many of them, to read their stories, hyperlinked from their wandering visages. 73 I didn’t know how to leave Boston, so I drove until I did. I fought battles at Lexington and Concord, but couldn’t tell if I was winning or losing, anymore, so I drove until I found Walden Pond. The guestbook at the gift shop contained comments from citizens of Italy, Australia, and Taiwan, among other places. We can know so much about where we’re going before we ever arrive. People across the world read a man’s words of this location, then arrived to see for themselves the lake they already knew were here. We needn’t even decode the language of dreams or intuition when we’ve invented so many technologies to tell us what we already know. I know how I look, or how I would look if I were not hiding behind this tree. An odd-looking character, writing in a notebook, writing… on Walden Pond! And at times I’m nothing more than a child who wants to know why he couldn’t just lie here among the wet leaves and sleep. I was never meant to pretend that my mind functions by way of simple logic. Let us relate the tales of the gods and watch these stories progress and let us not pretend that these gods influence nothing—when Cheers begat Frasier it represented little, but it represented some things. And if we can believe that a television program exists just because we all see it, why then can’t we understand that all gods exist in the same fashion? The gray of Walden Pond meshes with the gray of the fog that surrounds it. The complications of one human being necessitate the relief of another, and I’m recognized by thousands of casual observers who have far more than a casual influence on me. I live for the coming together of strange, wonderful dimensions. I have come so far, so far, and still I wonder to where I might be headed, and the road is exciting. When I first visited V. at the age of seventeen, in California, her father said, “So, you’re from Massachusetts. Have you ever been to Walden Pond?” and I said that I hadn’t. I flash back to these times. I am, as we all are, pushed in this way and that by words and imagery. The battle is simply to live, simply. 74 I took the long way back to the Pioneer Valley. I was haunted. I still wasn’t employed. Much time had passed while I remained in my mother’s basement, living these little tales, writing these little songs, and learning. The phantom of What I Should have been Doing was knocking on my door, loudly, repeatedly, keeping me awake. I felt like something had to break, although things had already been breaking in the life that surrounded me—cars, relationships, anything that people turned to for support. Helena, at the South Street Diner, had remarked that, although I was surrounded by people and social events, I was very solitary. I was never quite sure how to ask for advice. And when I received advice, I was never quite sure whether to trust it—because advice, from my experience, was usually wrong. I sat in Amherst because I was sick of keeping between the yellow lines, sick of waiting for the car in front of me to make that turn, sick of being constantly alert for the street signs that told me where to go. But when I sat on a sidewalk bench and observed the students who passed by, I realized I was doing the very same thing. What would be the next sign that would show me the way? I decided to look in the record store… but I knew that I might not be young forever. 75 I arrived at the apartment of Lydia and Tommy, hearing from the hallway the sound of Lydia gathering up phlegm or something. I always really liked spending time with her, although it didn’t happen that often. “I knew I recognized that phlegm,” I said. Upon seeing me, Tommy told me to follow him to his room. He showed me his newly augmented collection of music equipment. “Check this out, it makes you sound like… like Eddie Van Halen or something. ” He gave me his number and said I should come around sometime to Fuck Around with his stuff. 76 Amherst, Massachusetts. The wind blew, so cold for mid-November. I applied at Rao’s Coffee. I wasn’t really expecting to get the job. The harshness of the weather led me to take shelter inside of Raven Used Books. I read pages from various volumes, spanning the genres. The French Revolution. Women’s Studies. The notebooks of Mark Twain. Sometimes I would find something I hadn’t seen from a familiar author, and it would seem to me like a misplaced letter from a faraway friend. I loved to know that I lived in the same world as these well-documented figures. I saw the same cities, read the same books, knew the same humanity. I wondered how many distant relatives of these historical figures I had known in my daily life. I found comfort when I could know that person one was deeply influenced by the words of person two while fraternizing on the weekends with person three. It made things seem so much simpler when I, a twenty-first century American, could imagine that I was part of some sort of community. 77 I met Helena at the house of her friend Ana’s parents. Shoes were removed at the door. Helena and I were on the living room floor while Ana twisted into strange sitting positions on the chair. Helena’s hair curled in front of her face when she leaned forward, waiting for me to say something. Unlike many who speak excitedly of their own stories, Helena seemed neither nervous nor vulnerable when she asked a question. She seemed excited by the uncertainty of listening for a response, like a contestant on wheel of fortune who had just spun the wheel. We watched a video from the Babysitter’s Club series. Ana prepared coffee for us. Upon leaving to retrieve it, she pointed to me, and said, “Cream and sugar?” “Yes,” I replied, then to Helena: “How did she know that?” “She can tell,” Helena said. 78 As practice, Helena wasn’t wearing her glasses, because she was switching to contact lenses soon. This made her nervous. She had been talking about cutting her hair. She was looking for Change. 79 I hugged Helena goodbye and gave Ana a handshake. 80 I wasn’t going home yet. My night wasn’t over yet, I knew. So I drove north to the Whately Diner. 81 Robyn’s car was in the parking lot. I sat in my own car for a bit, parked outside of the diner, preparing myself. Robyn had gone back and forth with me, and we had spent long periods of time without seeing each other before falling back into romance several times. I wanted us to exchange letters someday, when she would be in New York and I would be hiding away in some forest somewhere. I didn’t know if this was ever to be, but I was ready to try. I didn’t know where she would be in the diner, so I didn’t look for her, only found the one open table and sat down. While I removed my coat and placed it to the side of me, she sat down. Hands cupped together on the table. She was wearing her glasses today, and her hair was on the shorter side now, which made her appear more powerful. I really liked the way she wore her coat, which was a new coat. It was long, and black. A special coat. I loved her. 82 I told Robyn the stories that I had been meaning to tell her. She told me that she had quit a dance company on the day when she’d been expected to sign a contact, because They had been planning to start touring, and she hadn’t wanted to exhaust herself like that. “Well, do you want to be a True Genius?” I asked. “Yes,” she said, extinguishing her cigarette in the ashtray. “Then I think you’re on the right path. ” 83 Maybe in some ways I was building a family, even if it was a distant one, spread across the country. Maybe I really wasn’t alone, when I could bum an American Spirit Light from the light of the past. Maybe we could still taste the sweetness of history, sometimes. 84 But Love did not move mountains—Relativity moved mountains. The final page of Love would never be written, because Love flowed from all directions: from the past through memory, from the present through the senses, and from the future through commissions. Love vindicated itself by the nature of its existence. Love could not be manipulated; only people could be manipulated. To attempt to live out a fantasy in the name of Love would be foolish. Even if we found some way to wander in the fifth dimension, in the sixth dimension, these other four dimensions would never look the way they looked on the first go-around. This was the full experience, no matter what. Was I locked into time irreversibly in this permutation? I didn’t know. The more I wrote of it, considered the question, the more the danger that I was sabotaging myself. Angels were a private business. I needed to sublimate, as did we all! And while it was hip to believe otherwise, these days, sublimation was the origin and necessity and purpose of all art. Art—the Love-stimulant! Love was neither cause nor effect. Love illuminated Us. That was all. No stories I could write would change this fact. Communication, Structure, Commitment—these were building blocks to a Relationship. I had forgotten what a Relationship was. Now I was beginning to understand (although it was surprising that I didn’t already know) that Love and Relationships were different things. Relationships were business deals crafting stability. A wave of Love came, went, zoomed this way and that, and had its ups and downs. Love was not found in a person; Love led to a person. One might watch Love inhabit a lover’s body, then begin to see it seep into the grass that this lover lay in. It was all so simple. I wasn’t capable of a Relationship. I wouldn’t even have known where to look for one. But I received so much affection—and patience and tolerance—from the people who liked me. They all deserved such wonderful things, I thought to myself, whether they received it from me or from anyone else. I was twenty-one years old. "

    "body": "1 I was hell-bent on going to goth night, simply for a change of scenery, and also to chase the distant hope of perhaps meeting some new people. Sarah N. was there, which made me happy until I tried talking to her and realized that she felt uncomfortable around me. She and Jonny talked for much of the night while I sat alone, watching the dance floor. I was approached by a guy who had served me at Denny’s one night, who not only remembered seeing me around in high school but also, impressively enough, somehow remembered my name. Later on I would end up sitting around as he and a guy in a mohawk who went by the name of Harvey talked. I saw that Charlie had a journal with him that he was scribbling into and showing to Harvey. We exchanged LiveJournal usernames. 2 Yesterday afternoon I headed out with Charlie, because, I guess, a band was playing some sixteen year old girl’s birthday party in Northampton? My mom was nice enough to pick him up and drive us to Mount Holyoke College. We sat and drank coffee at The Thirsty Mind while he went into the details of his life story (the telling of which I demanded, and which took two full hours, nearly uninterrupted by me, for him to complete. ) We missed the bus to Hampshire College and walked around the campus of Mt. Holyoke for a while under the mistaken notion that the bus would be stopping somewhere else on the campus. An hour and twenty minutes later we boarded the next bus. We arrived at Hampshire College. We were cigarette-less, arriving just in time for the store there at the school to be closed. I got a big Cow Tail from the vending machine and took out a bent fork that I found in it as well. We went into the dorm room of Carli and her boyfriend Brady. By now it was too late to go to the show, but that mattered little. We sat around in the dorm room for a bit, talking and looking at LiveJournal entries and pictures of erotic anime, missed the next bus to Amherst and also the next bus to Northampton. Went with Carli, Brady, and someone else whose name I forget to what was supposed to be a “sober dance” on campus, which it turned out was held by some motorcycling organization, so… it was filled with sober bikers. We left, then Charlie and I caught the bus to Northampton, met his friend Chris at his workplace, the Hotel Northampton. She said she’d give us a ride back to Chicopee, but she also said she wouldn’t be getting out until late. We sat at Fire &amp; Water for a while, Charlie ran into some people he knew, and I ran into one girl, Amy, I knew. We sat about, left, went back to the hotel, got a hold of Chris again by way of the phone, were told she was going to be there for quite a while later… so we began to walk towards the residence of someone Charlie knew nearby. We passed a crowd of people coming out from the Iron Horse music theater, and I said, “Oh, that reminds me, I missed the Frank Black show. He was supposed to have played a couple nights ago, I think. ” So Charlie asked someone coming out what the show tonight had been and surely enough it had been Frank Black. “Too bad we missed the show. I probably would have been able to get us in there for free. In fact, I’m sure people are still hanging around there now,” said Charlie as we walked away from the venue. “Yeah,” I said, “And my friend Marie was supposed to be going to that show. Maybe she’d have been able to give us a ride home. ” But instead of going back there we just kept walking towards his friend’s house. He wasn’t there. One of his roommates reluctantly answered and, after much coaxing, opened the door, although he was ready to fall asleep. It was a cold night, so Charlie lied and said that he just wanted to use the bathroom. We obtained warmth for a brief period of time that way. Then we went to the outside of the Iron Horse. Marie (who broke up with Patrick some months ago) was there with her very shy fiancé. We talked some and then sat down in the entranceway for the Iron Horse for shelter from the wind. Frank Black walked out between Charlie and me, zooming past everyone else and crossing the street. Marie grabbed a pen, chased him down (yelling, “Hey, you!”) and secured autographs. Marie and her crew took off. Charlie and I went back to Fire &amp; Water and stayed there until they closed, which was probably a little before 1:30 AM. To keep warm we went to the elevator at the parking garage and sat inside there. Sitting in an elevator led to a discussion of sex in strange places, which I transformed into an inquisition about love, which segued into a talk about the books of Francesca Lia Block. We left to go back to the Hotel Northampton, called Chris again from the phone there and she told us to hang out at Jake’s, the restaurant across the street. Neither of us had ever been in there before. We sat and ate a little and tried to stand quarters up on their sides. Chris came at about 3:15 in the morning or so and drove us back to Chicopee. 3 I played the open stage night at Fire &amp; Water—two of my songs, “I Melt” and “Stay for a Rainy Day”. I impressed an Aquarian woman who asked me my name so she could look for it in print when I become famous. My mention of the name “Levi” brought on a tale from her of how she recently discovered herself to be a descendant of the Levites and also a relative to Levi Strauss. 4 I woke up this morning, ate breakfast, went back to sleep, woke up again, then ate breakfast again. As it turned out, while I was asleep the second time, Brielle left a message on the answering machine: “Well, I’m calling because you told me to call someday… and I’m curious if you’re returning to school next semester. So, send me an email and let me know if you’re still alive. ” This makes twice that she’s called since our breakup last April. The first time was in July or something like that, when she’d called from her car to say that she was in the area and wanted to pick up her Tickle Me Cookie Monster stuffed toy. I told her then that I would like some time to prepare for company. She said that she wasn’t willing to wait. She was rather hostile, actually. I just didn’t want to be groggy and smelly in a messy apartment when she arrived. 5 At Haven, I talked to Mick and he plugged the upcoming party that he was organizing. “The web site for it will be up soon,” he said. “You’re going to make a web site for the party?” “Yeah! We did for our last one. ” “Please tell me that you didn’t have your own domain for it. ” “Oh, we did! Now we just have one domain that we’ll use to link to all of our parties, though. ” 6 Jan. 17, 2001. Written at Fire &amp; Water. (On my hand) Ride upon meteor shower Web-like visible scars of dead galaxies Surround as we proceed (On paper) Heavenly dictation takes liberty to grace us with the necessary grains of understanding and empathy, only when we release ourselves from the naive notion that it is our own responsibility to take hold of this subsistence. Such is the coexistence of free will and destiny. (In poetry magnets) Did I yesterday embrace her secret rhythm Once how our soft eternity remembered the daughter Brilliant and Sacred We are old here Desire bellows away her chant But breathes her whisper 7 Wednesday I frightened my mom because I told her that I was taking the car out for coffee at 7:00 PM and didn’t get back until 3:30 AM. She’s used to not keeping tabs on me, but I guess the fact that I had taken the car concerned her. I added nearly 100 miles to the mileage that night. I picked up Charlie at Hampshire College, then went to Fire &amp; Water for Word on Wednesday. Too many people had already signed up, so I didn’t get to read. Neither did Marie, who was also there. Charlie, Marie, and I went next to the Whately Diner. We weren’t there ten minutes before Ethan, Justin, and a gal I didn’t recognize sat down in the booth next to us, not noticing me. I walked up to Ethan and said “Excuse me, sir, do you have an extra cigarette?” The gal’s name was Julia. I knew her as the clerk I always bought cigarettes from at the CVS inside the Holyoke Mall, but it turned out she was also Justin’s bandmate. So, for most of the night Ethan and Marie took turns speaking loudly, telling stories and cutting each other off, while Justin and Julia spoke quietly, mumbling in short sentences. I juggled the two conversations. Charlie wandered off after a bit and talked to Adam G. and other random parties. I drove Marie back to her fiancé’s house in the middle of nowhere, West Springfield. I returned home just in time to give the car keys to Bruce, who leaves for work around 4 AM-ish. Charlie and I talked for a little bit, until he started to get tired. We slept all cute and cuddly in my big ol’ bed that I don’t usually sleep in when I’m alone because it’s so big and intimidating. I woke up early. My mind gets ignited easily, so I started thinking, “Hey, where am I? Oh, I’m at home… with someone! With Charlie. Hey, we’re still in the same position as when we fell asleep. That’s neat. Okay, time to go back to sleep… oh, jeez. Now I’m too awake to sleep. ” So when Charlie woke up, I had already scrounged up change for cigarettes and made spaghetti. Went to Charlie’s for a bit as he tried to figure out how he could get to his old apartment. He wanted to pick up some of his belongings, but that didn’t work out. He seemed upset. Since his mother was going to the Aldenville Credit Union already, I caught a ride home with her. 8 The idea that friends aren’t around me, aren’t actively in my life, doesn’t really bother me. What really bothers me is the idea that people can view friendship as a temporary thing. People using people is such a common practice… but I just want smiles and mischief and good time and romance. I never expect people to return gifts I’ve given. This includes pieces of my heart. So I accept what happens, when it happens. You can’t force anyone to appreciate you after they’ve moved on. 9 I was hired to Electronics Boutique. Tomorrow, my last week selling videos at Saturday Matinee begins. 10 I played the open stage once more last night… I had broken a string yet again, but when I arrived, Charlie had already signed me up to perform, so I had to use someone else’s guitar. I played “Pieces” and “Extinguish to Vapor”. Before that I had stopped by HCC, at about 6:30 PM, because the highway traffic had persuaded me to take a detour through Holyoke. It was interesting. I stumbled across one guy that I used to talk to once in a while, so we chatted. I visited the green room and left a “best wishes” note on the chalkboard. After Fire &amp; Water we went to the Whately Diner. Charlie wanted to go to Harvey’s place in Sunderland. Harvey was sleeping, but he wanted to see a guy named Mike who was there anyway. A random girl stopped him as we were leaving the diner, asked to come along to wherever he was going. We snuck out without her while she wasn’t looking. I dropped Charlie off and drove home alone through empty streets… over mountains, through thick fog. It was nice. I gave my mother the last of the money I had in my pocket because of the gas I’d used. Online, I traded demo MP3s with Isaac. I went to sleep at 6 AM-ish. And now? Now I should start my day. I really have to drop off that Electronics Boutique paperwork… then tonight I’ll be off to the Club Metro with Jonny. It’s the four year anniversary of their goth night. 11 I haven’t written in this (physical) journal for some time. At the moment I sit inside the Club Metro. I don’t feel entirely social just yet, although I expect somewhat of a fun night—if only because I deserve it for going through the effort of getting on this dress. (Later, at Denny’s) I’ve been feeling like in some respects I’ve been under examination. And that’s when I begin to feel very self-conscious about what I write on LiveJournal. It doesn’t take much—but there were the assertions that V. has been reading my journal, Charlie actually bringing up the contents of its entries rather frequently. It’s one thing to know that Internet friends see what your thoughts and your feelings are. Even if perhaps you may meet them in person one day, new explorations written in words only expand upon vague notions that imagine what somebody in Massachusetts must be like. When the people you interact with on a regular, or even semi-regular basis, see into you, however, it’s like you’ve been regularly having heart-to-heart conversations with them. 12 Monday night at Fire &amp; Water, a guy went up, performed, and at the end of his second song proposed marriage to his girlfriend. She didn’t respond audibly, but he said, “Well, I take that a yes. ” After that, the two of them sat next to each other, and not only did I not see eye contact or whispered discussion, but they didn’t even have their arms around each other or anything. 13 After work tonight I came home for a bit, sat around, then decided I wanted to drive to Denny’s. A bunch of people were there or came there as I sat: Laurel, Hank, Tingley, Heather, Pete, Charlotte, Jess, Jessica, etc. etc. After everyone had moved to a preferred seating area, somebody randomly said, “Hey, it’s Charlie!” and surely enough, there he was. He was with Carli and Brady. Everything was packed into the van and they were just about to hit the highway, but he’d decided he wanted to go to Denny’s one last time to grab a coffee to go. Carli saw that I was inside, came in and said goodbye to me. Then somebody said, “Well, I’m leaving to hike up Skinner Mountain. ” I said, “Can I come?” He said, “Sure,” and so I joined a group of strangers trudging through deep snows on an unplowed road to get to the top of a mountain. 14 Holyoke Community College! Interestingly enough, little seems to have changed here. I couldn’t sleep this morning, so impulsively I decided to come here and see what the locals are doing this semester. At the moment: Greg H. and Justin B. talk to each other, ignoring the rest of the room. Danielle F. and Jack S. loudly banter back and forth. Conor alternates between reading from his textbook and making little comments. Cara Russo is either laughing and being spoken to, or is staring into space when she loses interest. Ben I. gathers his things. Spirits are high. Ah, it’s nice to see that the good times continue. When I first arrived here today, I was greeted by a girl I had talked to a little towards the end of last semester. To her I played the role of positive supporter: “Think positive,” I told her again and again. Brielle approached me. It was nice that she did this. We talked for some time—of what, I’m really not certain. But just like the times when we talked last semester, this was a pleasant experience. These red cushions in the lobby of 2nd floor C building—so many feelings I’ve felt, experiences I’ve gone through. And I think about that each and every time I sit here. I’m sure this won’t be the last time. Ben B. reads a scene for the playwriting class. Here I am, student again for a day. I see why this was so addictive. There is never a lack of stimulation, and I needn’t be responsible for my own entertainment. I keep thinking of how I wish I could talk to Brielle some more. I gave her a big ol’ hug, pulling her onto the cushions with me. She squealed and said that I was going to break her ribs. The best friendships are the friendships that can’t be friendships. A snowball fight is happening around me now. I never liked snowball fights. I should get home and go to sleep… but the possibilities inherent in having so many peers around are just so appealing. 15 Well, I’m up to 99 names on my AOL Instant Messenger buddy list now. Who will be the lucky number 100? Number 99 was a girl named Annie, whom I met tonight at the club. Backtracking… I worked tonight. One of the benefits of my new job is that I have the ability to decide how long of a break I want. The last night I worked with the manager, he asked me “Hey, do you want fifteen minutes or a half hour tonight? I’m doing the payroll now. ” I was thrilled. The man at the gas station by the club wasn’t excited to see that I was paying for my cigarettes with penny rolls and mixed coins. As Charlie had requested, I gave Harvey a big kiss and told him that he loved him and missed him and wanted to know why his phone was disconnected. He said that he must be calling the wrong number, because nothing is wrong with the phone line. It makes me feel good to meet new people. I thirst for it. With dozens of new acquaintances having entered my life recently, I shouldn’t still be yearning for introductions… but I entered the Club Metro silent and uninspired until two girls (individually, although they were there together) walked by and recognized me. “You should smile,” said the first, “I know where you come from. ” “Oh yeah?” I replied, “Where do I come from?” “HCC,” she said, then walked off. I stayed seated for about another minute until her friend came up and talked to me at greater length. I explained to her that I wasn’t taking classes this semester. “But weren’t you there yesterday?” she asked. I laughed. “Well, yes. I did go there yesterday, just to hang out. ” “Yeah, you were sitting on the corner while the snowball fight was going on. ” I stood outside. There were about three people out there. I asked, “So, what brings you people to stand outside?” and that brought about some idle chatter. Then, as we talked, a few girls came out and one flashed her breasts at the streets below. This caused another to scream/squeal. “Why are they screaming?” I asked the people I was talking to, “I mean… psychologically speaking. What is the motivation?” “They’re flashing. ” “Why? See, I don’t understand these things!” So I walked up to the girls and tried to make sense of it all. Somehow, this led to a discussion of George W. Bush and the 2000 election and politics in general. The people I’d been talking to joined in, along with some new faces. When people started introducing themselves I made a big deal out of trying to remember everyone’s name. Once I knew the names of everyone involved in the conversation, I decided to expand this to everyone who was outside. As new people came out, I asked them their names and tried to memorize them. Inside, I must have looked psychotic, the way I danced to “Siren” by Tori Amos. When I’m dancing, I tend to blank out, pick a random point within my line of sight and base my movement around that one area. I ignore everyone else on the dance floor: I feel their presence, but I don’t dance for them. We stayed at the diner for a good long while. Kilean showed up instead of going to his usual hangout spot of the Chicopee Denny’s. We all ended up speaking deeply, of love and fears and hopes. Annie at one point said, “Isn’t it possible to love more than one person?” which led to a conversation about polyamory. I was pleased to find that she shared my views, essentially… that the principles are sound, accounting for and accommodating the truths of emotion, but that few are really capable of living the ideals. “At this point I don’t hold expectations anymore,” I said, “I just let myself be whatever I sense is best at that time for people I care about. And I don’t regret that I’m not in a relationship. ” 16 I’m at Denny’s. I borrowed a pen from a woman who was in my Psychology of Love class last semester. I don’t remember her name. She’s the only one here I recognize. Colleen? I think I heard somebody call her that. She seems like she could be a Colleen. Of course, the first time I come here specifically hoping to run into people, I see no one. Maybe it’s too early… but I thought it was like 11 PM when I left. I’ve been chewing on the pen cap. The paper in the machine outside says that consumer confidence in the state of the nation’s economy has suffered its greatest plunge since the recession of ‘90-‘91. 17 The road trip being embarked upon by Charlie, Carli, and Brady has presumably taken them as far as Raleigh now. Charlie gave me a call this morning. As often happens when people call and I’m asleep, I heard and comprehended the message while he was leaving it, but never once did I think, “Hey, I could pick up the phone and talk to him!” 18 Hank invited me over to play Hungry Hungry Hippos in Amherst, so I went. Driving at night is a new hobby of mine. I always bring a cassette with me. I’ve been listening to a lot of the latest set of demos my online friend Colquitt has sent me. Hank’s room was, in its state of being cleaned hurriedly to accommodate a guest, comprised pretty much only of a bed, a computer and a bunch of action figures. So I made him introduce me to the action figures he had lying around, one by one. Then we talked and cuddled for a couple of hours. This morning I woke up to some sort of strange alarm. I probably would have panicked if not for the fact that I live in America, where there are many alarms and sirens and loud noises going around but they usually don’t mean anything at all. I lay awake for a bit, cold and not wanting to get up but not being able to sleep anymore. Charlie called and told me that Brady had decided he didn’t want him on the trip anymore; he was buying him a bus ticket home instead. "

One of us would say, “Tell me a story”, following by a single word, and the other would tell a story about their life that the word reminded them of. 21 My head rested against the jukebox. My feet were on the seat of the booth. My legs leaned against the side of the table. “Comfortable?” Hank asked. I nodded with too-cute, self-mocking enthusiasm and said, “Uh-huh!” Following this, there was a break in the conversation. I loved breaks in conversation. It gave me the opportunity to bring up whatever I felt like discussing. “Who was the oldest person you’ve ever been seriously involved with?” I asked him. “Seriously involved?” he asked. “Yes,” I said, “I mean, meaningfully, over somewhat of an extended period of time. ” He answered, then turned the question back on me. I had to think about it for a moment. “I was eighteen, she was twenty-three,” I said. “And the youngest?” he asked. “About six months younger than me,” I responded, “I’m not a pedophile. Which is how you know I’m not a man. All men are pedophiles. ” 22 Hank was on top of me, in somewhat of a straddling position, when he asked about Jonny. “How close are you to him?” he asked. “Well, not this close,” I laughed. “Damn!” he said. I think Annie may have said something similar to this at some point, although it felt more like joking from her. “Thank you for being good company over coffee, thank you for listening, thank you for kissing me… thank you for being a friend. ” I started singing the Golden Girls theme. He gave me a hug. 23 Everything disposable in the 21st century, every year the same presents are under the tree, just newer versions with a different color scheme crying out “New! State of the art!” Finally, we’ve reached the point of not wanting anything new—only bigger, faster, more. 24 I read last month’s issue of T3 magazine. When the shelf life of magazines is up, or when a new issue comes in, as an employee of Electronics Boutique I can take home a copy. I read about digital gadgets which, at my current rate of income, would take me about three years to pay off (with low financing charges). “And at this price, you won’t be too upset if you drop it and it breaks,” say the reviewers of these items. I begin to think some more about my plans to find another job. I’m working much less than I was told I would be. 25 The first person I see at the Club Metro is Tingley. It’s his first time being there. He introduces me to his girlfriend, Crow. Then I see Jonny. I’m surprised. It’s his twenty-first birthday. He had said that he wasn’t planning to come tonight. Tingley finds Jonny’s attire humorous and tells me, “It’s funny to see Jonny go from having the ‘alternative’ look to being gothy. ” Jonny says little to me. He usually says little at the club. He generally lurks around me, looks sad, then seems offended if I try to say anything to him. Tonight he lurks around me less. He disappears midway through the night. I lie on a couch. I wonder why I go to a club and lie on a couch. I already know all of my friends’ friends, and my friends stick to their friends. My friends play pool, sit at the bar, don’t have many friends at all, or don’t really want to see me while I’m there. What is there to look at? Fellow club-goers, moving quickly, quickly? Couples with their tongues in each other’s throat? I use even the weakest excuses I can find for chatting with someone, anyone: “Hello, people by the opening in the fence. People standing by the opening in the fence are usually interesting. What are you up to?”; “You’re watching the arcade machine. Is that interesting? You know, you can put money in and then play it yourself. Do you want fifty cents?”; and on really exciting nights: “Hi, want some water?” And it works… but still, I and the people I talk to often don’t click enough to justify talking at great length. I light matches, one by one. I watch them burn themselves down as I sit by the dance floor. Annie walks over to me. “Didn’t anyone ever tell you not to play with fire?” she smiles. We talk for a little. When she says goodbye she kisses me on the cheek. I dance to a remix of “Winter” by Tori Amos. By this point the dance floor is only sparsely populated. 26 I awoke on Wednesday evening in Chicopee, Massachusetts. I had fallen asleep in the morning, thoughtlessly leaving most of the lights on. My computer also had been left on. I saw the instant messages people had been leaving me throughout the day. Person X had signed on, off, on, off, on, off, the windows told me. I walked downstairs. I figured that I’d ask for the car. My mother was having her blood pressure taken by some woman. I found this odd. I was told that it had something to do with insurance. This still didn’t explain why it was happening in the house. I left before any needles became involved. I stood around in the Chaos Room. I began to consider a trip to the convenience store to buy cigarettes. I heard a knock on the door. It was Jonny. I still wasn’t completely awake. It took me a moment to realize that it was him. He asked if I wanted to go get coffee with him. I said that I’d some love coffee. We chose to go to the Whately Diner, simply because… well, simply because. We sat and chatted a bit. “I’m really excited about going to Seattle in April,” he said. “Hmm… well, while you’re out there, you know, you could always visit V. !” I smiled, “Remember, she’s in Portland. ” Kelly the Waitress refilled our coffee cups. “Portland, Oregon?” she asked. “I’m moving there in two weeks. ” Jonny and I laughed. “You can visit V. !” said Jonny. “Who?” She asked. “I… know someone there,” I said. “Oh, you should go sometime, then,” she replied, “It’s a great place. ” We left and started going south on I-91. Jonny asked, “How far north does 91 go, anyway?” “Well…” I tried to remember, “Up through Vermont at least, I know… no, wait. It goes to Canada. We took it up there on the French Club trip. ” “Wow, Canada,” said Jonny. “Yeah. Let’s go to Canada,” I said. “You want to?!” enthused Jonny, who was still in a good mood. “Yes,” I said. “Okay,” he said, “We’ll turn around at the next exit and go north. ” So we did. I took it upon myself to keep Jonny entertained over the course of the drive. I didn’t want him to back out midway through the adventure. It was nice, since he and I haven’t been having as many good talks as we once did. He said that he felt like randomly going to Canada on a whim was the culmination of a lot of things. He said that this wasn’t just the ending to a chapter of his life, but that it was an entirely different book… Book Two in The Life of Jonny. We stopped at a gas station in Brattleboro and utilized the facilities. After that our next stop was Wells River, at the P &amp; H Truck Stop. Jonny was scared by the ambiance of this particular establishment. We continued driving north. The full moon shone above the mountains. The car was searched thoroughly at the Canadian border. They didn’t seem to like the fact that we were there around 1 AM trying to enter their country for “an impulsive adventure”. Two agents went through the backseat, where I had left a dress once worn to the Metro, along with a vinyl outfit Jonny had worn on Tuesday. The female officer asked, “Do you gentlemen do any drugs?” No, we both said. “Are you going to any sort of a rave party?” Jonny got the look of disgust on his face that he always gets when someone mentions a rave. “Okay,” said the officer, “Normally I wouldn’t feel obliged to let you into our country. You have no baggage, insufficient funds to finance a stay, and nothing else to show that you’re legitimate visitors and that you’re not going to be a burden. But I believe what you’re saying, and I’m going to trust you. ” We ended up at Motel le Châtillon in Rock Forest, Quebec, just outside of Sherbrooke. Jonny went immediately to bed. I walked across the street to see if the Wal-Mart was open. It wasn’t. I sat down to write, and that leads me to now, 4:13 AM on Thursday. 27 1: So why are you in Canada? 2: Well, that’s a good question. See, I was with Jonny in Whately, and… 1: No, no. I understand the how of it. My question is, why? 2: Well, it’s not costing me any money. And it’s an adventure. 1: Okay. Please define your requirements for an “adventure”? 2: An adventure is doing something you have an impulse to do but which, generally speaking, you wouldn’t do. 1: But if you do something, that means you would have done it. 2: Hm? 1: If you do something, then saying that you generally wouldn’t have done it is incorrect. Because you’re doing it. 2: I don’t think that’s right. I wouldn’t have done this thing prior to this specific adventure. 1: That just means you didn’t do it. Have you had the opportunity to take a quick trip to Canada before? 2: There have been times when I could have done it, but I had other priorities. 1: Would it have been an adventure if you had gone to Canada before, on your own, when you had the resources to do it? 2: Yes. 1: So you didn’t take an adventure. You should recognize that that’s the choice you always made before. 2: I guess I thought the repercussions of these potential adventures wouldn’t be worth the adventures themselves. 1: So saying that you’re in Canada because it’s an adventure isn’t right. Because if that were reason enough to go, you would have gone before. 2: Like I said, it was free, too. It’s never been free before. 1: Ah. Yes, you did say that. Sorry about that. I’ve got some distractions here. 2: Now is it okay if I get to writing for a bit? 1: These questions are exercising your mind in ways that will be useful for you later on. You’re thinking about Brielle now, aren’t you? 2: I just want to write my way through this stuff. I don’t need an angel interview. 1: You filled in those gaps in your writing archives from when you were with Brielle. You went over what things were like, after you had been distanced from her for awhile. But why weren’t you writing much while you were with her? 2: I was busy. 1: Doing what? 2: Doing Hamlet. Going to school. 1: And doing homework. 2: What? 1: Sitting at The Thirsty Mind, night after night, doing homework. Which you previously didn’t put that much time into. 2: Brielle was focused on educating herself. 1: But you grew bored with that, didn’t you? 2: Hm. 1: Would you say that you bore easily? 2: I guess I do tend to be… always on the way to somewhere else. 1: But would you do things differently if you could change the past? 2: I would always do things differently if I could change the past. Out of playfulness if for no other reason. 1: If you could go back to that French Club trip, would you do things differently with Brielle? 2: I would try to do things differently, yes. 1: What could you have done differently? She made the decision that placed you in the same bed that first night, because she “didn’t like” the other room. And you two hadn’t been on speaking terms for a few days prior. 2: She probably wanted me back. 1: It sounds like it was your decision that ended the relationship, then. Did you break up with her? 2: I knew what was happening. 1: But you never said those words, did you? You never “officially” broke up with her. You just let her come to that conclusion on her own. 2: Because I didn’t know if I wanted things to end. I just wanted to be honest. 1: You thought that you deserved the perfect partner served to you on a silver platter. 2: Come on. 1: Am I making you feel like a self-centered jerk? 2: Not really. Among other things, I helped Brielle in a lot of ways. 1: Did you? 2: She’s doing well now. 1: Maybe someone else came along and supported her. 2: Maybe she supported herself. 1: You never thought that you could do better than her in terms of finding a secure partner. You just wanted more excitement. You sacrificed contentment for excitement. 2: Because I wasn’t smart enough to see that I could have found excitement in a life with her. Yeah. 1: Because you didn’t want to have to… 2: …expect her to go out of her way to support my adventurous nature. I wanted my ways to naturally fit into hers. And I didn’t want to hold her back to keep myself supported. I didn’t want to ask her for effort. 1: She would have adapted willingly. 2: But I had never been accommodated before. 1: That’s a melodramatic statement. Would you take Brielle back if you could? 2: Let me smoke a cigarette first. 1: You didn’t need cigarettes when you had her. 2: She was somewhat jealous. 1: She always listened to your concerns. And she always cared. And you resolved your differences with her, every time, and still slept peacefully. Until you stopped wanting to resolve those differences. 2: We weren’t even together that long. And she’s too smart to be the type to jump into rekindling an old relationship at this point. 1: So are you. But your wisdom says things that intelligence contradicts. And she was wise, just as you are. So it’s not an unthinkable hypothetical. 2: Ugh. Damn you. 1: Damn yourself. 2: Haven’t I already? 1: No, no. Not at all. 2: Yes, I would take her back if I could. 1: You’ve never before asserted that you would get into a relationship with anyone you didn’t already know you could have. Not in an interview, not anywhere else. 2: Well, that’s progress for you. I guess I’m setting myself up for learning what it’s like to not always achieve my goals, huh? 1: Maybe eventually. So what about V. ? Would you take her back? 2: You know, I do need that other pack of cigarettes. They’re right over there. So yeah. I’m just going to… walk over there. 1: I have no objections. You needed a lot of cigarettes when you were with her. 2: She is my soulmate. 1: You’ve said that. Do you really think so? 2: I do. Maybe that’s silly. 1: Can you relate to her as well as you can relate to— 2: No. 1: To Brielle? 2: To anyone. That’s what makes her my soulmate, I guess. 1: Sounds a little fishy. If your souls were cut from the same cloth, shouldn’t your ways be similar? 2: Our role in life is the same. We affect the world in the same way. What our meaning is, speaking externally, is the same. But we’re different aspects of this meaning, different manifestations of it, dispersed into this universe. 1: That’s quite an answer. You’ve thought of this before? 2: No. 1: If you could easily do it, would you go to Portland? 2: No. 1: Why not? 2: V. wouldn’t come back here. 1: How do you know? If she asked, would you let her? 2: No. 1: Why not? 2: Because I wouldn’t go to Portland. 1: It’s a great city. The waitress at the diner said so. 2: But just because we’re soulmates doesn’t mean we have to be together. 1: So you’d take Brielle back, but not V. 2: V. and I are better apart than together. 1: The fates disagree with you about V. 2: Okay. 1: Are you happier than you were with her in Bakersfield? 2: No, I’ve never been as happy as I was with her. 1: It sounds like you’re just not looking for an intense relationship these days. 2: Blah. 1: Lighting yet another cigarette? How many have you smoked already? Give them a count. 2: Okay. I’m not using my toes yet. That’s a good sign. 1: So, now, tell me about Hank. 2: I relate with him. He listens to me, I like listening to him, and his cuddling feels more genuine than… 1: More than any of the women? How about Liv? Maxine? 2: I think Rachel B. came close, strangely enough. 1: You barely got to know anything about her. 2: True. But the cuddles felt real. 1: There’s something uniquely nice about lying next to someone you’re not really romantic with. 2: And with whom I couldn’t picture myself being really romantic. Even though I lived with Maxine, she fit into that category. 1: Maxine thought differently of you. 2: We were young. 1: You’re still young. 2: Why won’t the fates just lead me to a life-changing relationship, if they’re so concerned with my love life? 1: Well, like I said, you’re not looking for that sort of thing. 2: Ah. So you have to push me or whatever. Okay. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. But, um, hey, I know you’re speaking to me from another time and all, but it’s 7 AM here, and stuff’s probably open by now. I’d like to go for a walk, see if there’s anything to see. 1: All right. I tried my best. 2: Thank you for this journey. It’s been productive. 1: Yeah. Could have been worse. 28 When I get back to Chicopee, I open a piece of mail that my father has sent. I take out the $25 check that’s apparently supposed to convince me to read his letters, then crumple up everything else and throw it into the trash. "

    "body": "29 Leon: “It turns out that, like, everyone knows you. ” Me: “Yeah. ” “I talked to Madeira and he was like ‘Yeah, I know who that is’ and said he’d love to work on some music with you. ” “Oh, cool. Yeah, I know of him, and I’ve seen him around, but I don’t think we’ve been formally introduced. ” “And then Veronica knew who you were, too. ” “Right, I’ve known her since HCC. ” “Madeira and Veronica would love your music. Especially Veronica, she’s all about a lot of experimentation. You know, you’re really versatile with your vocals. ” After enough compliments, I almost start feeling human. 30 Don’t forget cigarettes when you drive with a couple of straight-edge guys to Denny’s. Don’t ask to bum cigarettes from big, scary, football player type guys. Do ask for a light from guys with leather jackets. I still wonder whose George Orwell book that was on the counter. 31 “Les croquilles Munchos ont une texture si légère et un goût si incroyablement différent qu’elles sont tout simplement irrésistibles. ” The guy at the American border was a Munchos fan, too. “Do you have any alcohol or foods that you purchased while in Canada?” he asked. “Uhh,” said Jonny, “Coffee, and chips. ” “Munchos!” I exclaimed cheerfully. “Ah, yes,” said the officer, “It’s great that they have those in Canada, too. ” Audrey called me today, and just as has happened a couple times before, I was sleeping, so she said “Well, I’ll let you go back to sleep” and I climbed back into bed. I should tell her to stop feeling bad about waking me. I’ll almost always talk. I just might be a little unresponsive at first. Hopefully she’s still planning to come out west so that we can play in the snow. 32 Valentine’s Day rapidly approaches. I think two years ago I actually made a point of traveling from Massachusetts to California so that I’d be with V. on that day. Some might imagine I would remember things like this for certain. 33 I didn’t have time to do much of anything after work before Charlie called. He had just returned from his cross-country escapades. He told me a few tales. I picked him up. He directed me to Jennifer’s Kitchen, the only place open at 11:30 PM in Chicopee where we would be able to smoke inside while getting coffee. We talked for a bit, and both of us had on our minds that we felt we had to get out of the area as soon as possible. “I’d like to see California. And Portland,” he said. I laughed. “Portland. What is it with Portland? V. told me recently that if I ever want to visit, I’d be welcome to. ” “We should both save up money and then get out of here as soon as possible,” he said. Then something interesting happened to punctuate the virtue in this idea. Evil Chicopee trash from our high school walked in. They spoke very loudly, a few tables away from us. The things they said made no sense—and when I say this, I mean this. What were they communicating with their words? Offensiveness. Not creative offensiveness, not even clichéd offensiveness. It was stupidity, worn loudly and proudly. They don’t take themselves seriously, they just try to make everyone else feel like shit. Then, they point at the other people and laugh. I felt depression at the very sound of laughter for years because of these people. I’m not kidding. Charlie got up to go to the restroom. I didn’t overhear this conversation, but from what he related to me it went like this: “Hey, is that Charlie?” someone said. “Yes,” Charlie responded, “It is. ” “He sucked (Person X)’s dick!” “No, I didn’t,” said Charlie, “That’s a rumor. ” “You wrote in your LiveJournal that (Person Y) was dealing drugs!” another person said. “Yes, I did. ” “Fuck off before I spit in your face. ” Then I sat and looked at the comparison birth charts he and I had been mapping out from Linda Goodman’s Relationship Signs, which I’d given him as a Christmas gift in January. I tried to block out the voices of my peer group as much as I could. They started talking about me. “Hey, he went to Comp too,” said one. They made fun of my hair. Charlie returned from the restroom and started gathering his things. “We have to go,” he said. “Yes,” I replied. “Any more coffee?” asked the waitress. “No, we’re going, the money’s on the table,” I said. “We’re just getting harassed by some of your customers,” said Charlie. “Oh, I’m sorry,” said the waitress. “No, it’s not your fault,” I said. “Not at all,” Charlie agreed. We exited. As I drove away from the restaurant, I was still feeling shocked. They were my age! And they were still acting the same as they’d been acting since the seventh grade! Exactly the same. But unlike throughout my school days, this time I hadn’t been alone in being the focus of ridicule. Harvey had invited us to go over to his place in Sunderland. We went there and watched High Fidelity. I lost track of it partway through because of the random banter between Charlie, Harvey, and Shaved Head Ben. I started copying down the explanations of various correlations between Charlie’s astrological chart and mine. Charlie went to the kitchen and called up Madeira in spite of the fact that it was by then past 4 AM. The rest of us eventually wandered in the kitchen as well, after the movie had ended. I asked to talk to Isaac. We discussed musical things. He said that he and Madeira would play with anyone. That was great, I said. Charlie stayed on the phone, ignoring the rest of us, even as Harvey wrestled and accosted him in numerous ways. His eyes always looked downward as he talked on the phone. He tuned out the outside world. Having seen the madness of his home, I understood now how he had obtained this skill. “Hey, Charlie?” I say, “I’m comparing our chart, and Linda Goodman says we’re soulmates. ” “Big deal,” said Harvey, “Those books say that everyone’s soulmates. ” Following that, I stopped for a quick coffee alone at the Whately Diner through the warm, damp morning. Then I went home, where I immediately talked to Audrey. She’s on her way westward to come and meet me. Who needs sleep, anyway? 34 It often works this way: I see the person I’m expecting to meet, out of the corner of my eye. But I’m not entirely certain, even as they approach, that they are the party I seek. So, rather than leaving open the possibility of my staring at a stranger, I turn my head and pretend to be distracted by something. I waited to see through my peripheral vision that Audrey was only a few feet away before I turned to face her. “Hello, Levi,” she said. We shared the usual unspoken momentary acknowledgment of each other. “Hello,” I said, immediately giving her a hug. No shaking, no worry, no unnecessary movements. Maybe just because I had been going without sleep, and there is such a thing in my experience as being too nervous to be anxious. But also, I was more comfortable with meeting a single stranger, one-on-one, making a first impression on someone from far away, than I would have been if I had been meeting someone introduced to me by a friend or whatever. My charm was great. Even indoors, it struck me that she was wearing a tank top in the middle of February. She only ordered a water. I had coffee. We went to the Fairfield Mall, where the only places that hadn’t yet closed down permanently were Subway and the Registry of Motor Vehicles. “Let’s sit!” I said in the long hallway leading to an obscure entrance door. We sat and talked some more. Then I made her jump, in fact going through much effort to convince her to jump. She took off her shoes and got a running start. It was fun. The move toward romance was made quickly. We had hurried through the now cold and windy parking lot. She had jumped into puddles for fun. We sat in her car. Her car was decorated throughout with leopard print. I covered myself with a blanket from the back seat. I have little memory of how we went from sitting in our respective seats and chatting like normal human beings to cuddling with each other under the same blanket. I think the earliest provocation was my grabbing her hand and touching it lightly, saying, “Hands are beautiful. I like hands. ” We moved to cuddling to kissing to deeper kissing. A police officer came and bothered us, but he didn’t tell us to leave, so we stayed. We separated ourselves from each other while the cop was in the area so that he would feel dumb for parking on the other side of the lot to keep an eye on us. 35 Hours passed while we were together, saying nothing, simply in affection. Connecting with Audrey wasn’t a challenge. She was reluctant to share things with me, to speak about particular things, but she didn’t seem to resent me for caring. I didn’t smoke around her. We went back to my apartment. I was extremely overtired, but I remained awake for some time in spite of this. Eventually I started to fall asleep, too tired to fight it any longer. We had taken our clothes off and were in my bed. She pulled on my arm. “I’m going to play naked in the snow. Want to come?” “(Mumbling) That sounds cold. The neighbors might find a naked girl running around in the cold a little odd. ” “That’s okay—they’ll like it. ” “No, thank you. ” “Okay, I’m going to the bathroom. ” “Okay. ” She kissed me, then said, “Okay, I’m off to play in the snow. ” “Huh?” “I mean, go to the bathroom. ” “I’m confused. ” She went to the bathroom. I fell asleep. She lay down next to me. I woke up at 4 AM. She half woke up, looked at me, smiled, and kissed me. We went to Friendly’s for breakfast. She said that as a rule she never ate breakfast, but I convinced her to get something. She had a bagel and home fries. When we got back to my place, things got more sexual… up to a point. Then things stopped, and said that she was feeling uncomfortable. “You don’t know about me,” she said. “You don’t understand the kind of girl I am. There are things I haven’t told you. ” I said that it was okay, that she could tell me. She said that she didn’t want to hurt me. Then she left. 36 Audrey was gone. I still hadn’t stepped back to really analyze what had gone down, but being awake in the morning with no plans on my agenda for the first time in quite a long while made me want to get out. I read an email from Brielle that told me she had dropped off at my workplace the journal I had forgotten in her care. So I went to pick it up. I walked into the store. The mall was very busy. Tracy, my manager, said, “Hi! I don’t suppose you’d feel like working, would you?” I said, “Um, if you really need me to, sure. ” As usual, he badmouthed the other employees to me—Rich, who hadn’t come in yet and was already very late, and Aaron, the other new guy, whose abilities as an employee, Tracy always felt the need to explain to me, were inferior to mine. I told him that I wanted to have a smoke and grab something to drink before I started. But when I came back, Rich was there anyway. The mall was too busy for me to have much fun. Also, Galaga wasn’t working at the arcade. So I went to Northampton. I bought a replacement guitar string for my acoustic guitar, then went to the Haymarket to get coffee, to sit, and to write. 37 “By the way, Bruce,” I said to my mother’s boyfriend, “Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day. Just so you remember. ” “I know!” he said, before turning the subject around to me. “Are you going to buy something for your valentine?” “What?” I said, pretending not to have heard him correctly, “Am I going to buy myself a valentine? Yes, I am. I’m going to buy myself several valentines. ” Then I left. “Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day, and what do you have to show for it?” I asked Rich at work as he read a Dragon Ball Z magazine. “An eight hour shift at the mall,” he replied, without looking up. Charlie called me at work, explaining that he’d found a way to get to the Club Metro, but that he still needed money. So I told him that yes, I’d pay for him to get in. “Hey, that was someone asking for money on the phone,” I told Rich, “So I’m going to make an ATM run. ” “They were asking for money?” he said, confused. “Personal call,” I said. “Oh. ” I was already waiting outside the mall after closing when Jonny pulled up. He had told me in advance that he would want me to drive his car that night so that he could get drunk at the club. We were early, waiting at the door for the under 21 crowd to be let in. Charlie wasn’t there yet. Some other of my friends were already there, so conversation helped the time pass. Tingley was wearing a Batman shirt and underneath that, a Superman shirt. “So if you feel like hiding in the shadows you can be Batman, and if you feel like being social you can be Superman!” I enthused. Rose sat on my lap for awhile. I hadn’t seen her in a while. “It’s so funny,” I told her, “You’ll be really distant and emotionless and barely acknowledge people sometimes, but then you’ll sit on their lap and cuddle and tickle them. ” She told me that Frederick’s of Hollywood, where she works, had earned four times their goal that day, even though their goal had been based on the previous year’s earnings. Mall security had come to help watch the store because business had been so heavy. After dancing some, I sat by the dance floor and noticed Hank sitting across from me. He saw me as well and walked over to talk. That close to the loud music we had to speak directly into each other’s ears, which is a strange sensation because you feel the force of a person’s wind upon your eardrum just as much as you hear their words. “Sitting alone, bored, watching the dance floor?” I asked. “Yeah,” he replied. “Same here. Tell me your story. ” “But I always tell you my stories. I want to hear about you. ” “My stories are too complicated to sum up into a little sound bite. ” “Oh, and mine aren’t?” he teased. I shrugged. He told me about the guy he’d spent last week with, how they’d known each other, what had happened. They’d been trying to figure out a way for him to come visit from Connecticut, but it didn’t look like it was going to happen. We hugged a lot and then Charlie walked up. He had gotten inside, but still needed to pay. I gave him the six one dollar bills that I had in my wallet. He ran off to get another dollar from Harvey. “I’m looking into your eyes! You can’t complain about that now,” said Charlie to me, referencing a recent LiveJournal post. I was holding him in some fashion. I shoved Kestrel against the wall, wrestled him to the ground and stole his stuffed Cheshire Cat. Charlie grabbed my hand and led me to the dance floor. We danced to Nine Inch Nails. Midway through the song, a girl I didn’t recognize came by and stole him away. I saw Rose on the steps and sat down next to her. Charlotte was there, as well. “Why are you sitting here?” I asked Rose. “Because she was sitting here,” she replied, pointing to Charlotte. “Why are you sitting here?” I asked Charlotte. “I don’t know,” she replied. “So I’m sitting here because Rose is sitting here, Rose is sitting here because Charlotte’s sitting here, and Charlotte doesn’t know why she’s sitting here. Hm. I wonder how many more people can be sucked in by this sequence?” “I knew that was Charlie as soon as I saw him,” said Annie. “How’s that?” I asked. “I don’t know,” she replied, “I could just tell. ” Some people at the corner of the dance floor were hitting a balloon to keep it adrift. I grabbed it and held it tightly. “This is my valentine,” I told Charlie. “I still don’t have one,” he replied. “You can have mine. I’ll go valentine-less. ” He gave it back to me. We let it float in the air some more, then lost it. “I lost my valentine,” I said with a mopey expression. “That’s okay,” he said, “We’re together. ” “Together alone?” I asked. “No,” he said, “Not alone. ” “Do you want to go outside to the porch?” I asked. “I have to grab my coat,” he said. After he had grabbed his coat and been distracted a few times, we went outside. I lay down on a table. He joined me. “So tell me about this girl, Jenn,” he said. “I like her,” I said, “We talked, and then we cuddled, that was great, then we kissed and things just kept moving. And it wasn’t just a… thing, because I don’t have…” “You don’t have… just… things,” he said, finishing my sentence. “Yeah. So I want to see her again. But I don’t feel like it’s the sort of situation where I could, or should, want to have a serious long distance relationship. I don’t feel like that could work. And it felt right, but now it all becomes so complicated. ” “Don’t worry about it,” he said. “How can I not worry about it?” I asked. “Just don’t. Things like this happen. ” “Do you want to go to the Word on Wednesday tomorrow?” he asked. “Oh, I suppose. Though it’ll be Valentine’s Day. Scary!” “Ugh, I didn’t even think about that. So everyone’s going to be reading sappy, depressing love poetry. ” “And there we’ll be, all alone. ” “Yeah. ” I hesitated, then finally said it: “In all honesty, I wish I could have you as my valentine. ” “I need a valentine,” he responded, then said, “I don’t want to push us too far into the ‘friend zone’. ” The night began to wind down and people began to leave. Jonny had only had two drinks, but he thought he was drunk. I told him that I felt he had safeguards implanted into his personality that prevented him from ever really being self-destructive. I drove his car to the Whately Diner. He was proud of how I handled the vehicle even though the steering wheel was very loose compared to what I was used to. Hank came to the booth where Jonny and I sat. He sat next to me for a time, then went back to where he’d been sitting. “I think you seem like a really nice person,” I said to Kelly the Waitress. “Thank you,” she replied. She left and Harvey said, “Now, come on. If we’re going to flirt with the waitress we’re going to have to do a little better than that. ” “No, I wasn’t flirting,” I said, “I just think she seems like a nice person. ” Jonny was ready to drive by the time we left. He dropped me off and then went home. I slept. 38 I had to push myself to believe that I had the power to change myself when I had no friends, when I was convinced that I was ugly and awkward to such a degree that I must be completely unlovable. I told myself that if I tried, if I tried, I could change myself. I could make myself lovable. I obsessed over my physical appearance, then. I walked for miles everyday. This was partially because it was something to fill my empty days with, but also partially because I wanted so desperately to lose weight. I stared at my face in the mirror multiple times each day: was I a little bit more attractive? Were my cheeks a little thinner? Maybe… but if so, it still wasn’t enough for me. So, I would decide that I didn’t really need another meal that day. I distinctly remember one time when I went to sit beside my mother’s bed… I used to do that when I was younger, just to momentarily break out of the tedium of a life spent in my bedroom alone. I was wearing my Spawn shirt. She said, “Oh my god, look at you! You really are getting pudgy, aren’t you?” Those words stuck with me. My mother was almost never affectionate with me. I remember one time, she told me she loved me over the phone while I was in California. She was crying. I was seventeen years old, sleeping in strangers’ homes, going for long periods of time without calling, telling her nothing about what was going on in my life. My father had been affectionate with me when I’d been young… then he went mad. He tried to convince me to live with him, every time I saw him. He told me how wrong my mother was for leaving him, every time I saw him. He was a nervous wreck. Then he moved to South Carolina. My parents’ divorce came just in time for me to enter a big, scary middle school where all the students and teachers hated me. “Tell me your life story,” I ask everyone, but I don’t even know the life stories of my own mother or father. I’d like to receive unconditional love. Until then, I give it freely, because I need to put my love somewhere. 39 I drove to Northampton, where Charlie was waiting for me at Fire &amp; Water. I always feel strange when I’m sitting at Word on Wednesday with someone else next to me. I expect one of the other patrons to smack me and call me rude if I don’t offer the readers 100% of my attention. The night before I had been decently dressed, with my suit jacket that always makes me look fancy regardless of what I wear with it. But for Valentine’s Day itself I just wore bluejeans and a PJ Harvey tee shirt. The readings were good. There were a lot of new faces. A few different people recognized me from the open stage and complimented me on my music. We went to the Whately Diner, then. We talked to a guy who knew Japanese, DJ Todd from Haven and a guy he was sitting with, and Kelly the Waitress once she started her shift. Charlie had been debating whether to go home or to Harvey’s. I had also extended the offer that he could stay at my place. But he said she would rather go to Harvey’s. In a huff, I said, “Well, fine, then!”. “What, did you want sex or something?” he said back. “No. ” “Are you… disappointed?” “Kind of, just personally. I don’t hold it against you or anything. ” I stopped in at Harvey’s for awhile. “How was your date?” he asked as we walked in. “Oh, that was a date?” I said, “Oh, wow! Neat! Yes, it went well. ” We watched South Park. I cuddled next to Charlie. “Oh, get a room,” said Harvey. Then I left. 40 And so the pace of life here picked up; but as it did, it seemed that I was moving more slowly. What had two weeks meant to me when I was in grade school? A new side-scrolling video game to play all the way through? A couple of new issues drawn on notebook paper, My World Meets Stanley the Happy Shark? Now this same length of time might mean to me a few dozen journal entries, each one improvising on the theme of a day. The improvisations, then, burned themselves into my memory. It’s true that I knew the technology, so that I was able to hit “record” and punch an overdub into my life story here and there. But whatever the future held for me, I would need to contend with this permanent record—a record that would stay clear enough to my mind that Massachusetts in early 2001 would become like a place of myth. Kids doing stupid shit can in the right light start to seem like the actions of the gods of Mount Olympus. None of us did anything special, but we preserved the visions of our young selves. We came as close to self-immortalizing as we could, and this, I think, is the secret to almost everything. 41 On Thursday I went with Charlie to his friend Brenden’s house. The walls of his room were covered with Rolling Stone covers. He sat on the futon and worked on a drawing. Charlie had decided that he wanted to visit him because he was hungry and wanted a Hot Pocket. About half the contents of this household’s freezer was Hot Pockets. Charlie put one in the microwave and came back to Brenden’s room. About ten minutes later he went to get the food, but unfortunately found that he had set the microwave incorrectly. On my way to the bathroom, I heard him yell, “Fire! There’s a fire!” There wasn’t really a fire, but there was a lot of smoke and it did smell quite awful. I asked Brenden for his life story. He reluctantly detailed some basic information. Charlie then began to ask him more detailed questions and before long the two of them were reminiscing about growing up in Chicopee. Driving to Denny’s, then, we listened to a tape of Charlie’s dramatic performance (in 1983, when he was 2 years old) of a book called Willy Woo Woo Woo. Coincidentally, I had learned to read using the same book. 42 Charlie came over for a short time before I went to work on Friday. He talked on the phone while I played Minesweeper on the computer. I pointed out the hatch in my ceiling and said, “We don’t know what’s up there. No one’s ever really looked. ” So we climbed up. It was a large open space, with very tall ceilings. It looked like it could easily be turned into another level of the house if only floors were installed—well, floors, and also some means for getting up and down rather than having to climb through a hole in the ceiling of the second floor. It was primarily insulation, with boards to move along. Wooden, you could see the frame of the house, and the shape of the roof. Charlie said, “This is the perfect kind of place to, like, come and do…” “Yeah,” I agreed before he finished the sentence, thinking “…rituals… séances…” “…to do crack or something,” he finished. I laughed. Bruce drove me to work, dropping Charlie off at the liquor store up the street because he was supposed to meet someone there. At work, Jonny returned a call that I’d made to him earlier about a party at Erica B. ’s place. He said that he’d go. Kilean came into the store. “Prepare to be fliered,” he said, plopping goth club ads down on the table. He told me that he was going to be DJ’ing (with DJ Todd) at the all ages goth night at the Metro on Monday. I told him that I’d go, although the idea of being in a club with fifteen-year-old goths somewhat frightens me. I answered the phone and it was a big-shot person, the District Manager or something, asking for Tracy. “Oh, that was Levi,” Tracy, the Store Manager said to her, “Him? He’s doing fine. Aaron, on the other hand, is not. ” He went into the back room for most of the conversation, but came out briefly to get information on me from the register. Jonny picked me up after closing. We also picked up Charlie, then headed to Erica’s place in Florence. Some people I knew from HCC were at the party: Conor, Lynn, Jack. Neither of them drank. Jonny didn’t drink, either, and Charlie just had two cups of wine. I, on the other hand, had two cups of wine, a rum and coke, one of Erica’s famous “chubby toes”, and a screwdriver. It was fun for me. Basically what happens to me when I’ve been drinking is, I stare people in the eyes when I’m talking to them, I wander around less, I feel more human so I tend to feel more free to share my opinions (although my opinions are still always nice) and I knock stuff over because—well, I do that while sober, even. A guy told me about how he had gotten jumped for being Puerto Rican, a woman told me about her sons, a guy told me about his work in software design, I talked with Jack and Lynn about the HCC production this semester, I talked to Anne-marie from Serious Play!, I had a discussion about the stock market, I talked about my play to a few of Erica’s friends who had gone to see it. Charlie stayed over that night and kept me company while I slept. But again I didn’t sleep for very long. 43 I called Marie’s cell phone and she was at her Friendly’s in Springfield with Maurice and his girlfriend. Maurice, her guitarist, is now going to school in the Boston area. Also, I traversed most the width of the state, from Agawam to Whately, with Tingley and Jonny last night. Just for coffee. "

    "body": "44 I spoke with my mother about the idea of moving. As one would expect, the words “stupid” and “impossible” came from her mouth multiple times. She still lacks the ability to see things as I see them. I’m one to try to slip through the cracks however I can. And yes, this is more difficult when it comes to anything financial or “real world”-ish than it is in educational, social, or artistic matters. But still. The point is to set goals and to reach them regardless of obstacles. I want to begin to stabilize a life as I want it. Living in Chicopee, Massachusetts upstairs from my mother and asking for a vehicle anytime I want to be anywhere aside from home is not the life for me. My workplace needs to cut back on payroll hours. Ha! So I’m working four hours tomorrow instead of five. At least I brought in some extra money for myself when I agreed to work today. Business was mad, crawling with children who are on winter break. We didn’t get those PS2 consoles that we were expecting, though. 45 The idea of going to the all-ages goth night was really pure silliness. It was amazing to watch the awkwardness of it all. The music was mostly straight-ahead goth. I felt really tall. I actually think I met and chatted with more people than I ever have at Haven. A lot of the ways of the club-goers were similar to the ways of the people at Haven, except that their tonguing and groping were replaced with kisses on the cheek. Lori and Lisie were there. I had met them at Haven a couple of weeks prior, when I had made a point of learning the names of everyone who came outside onto the patio. With a little bit of struggling I remembered their names. I was proud of myself. They had come with a friend of theirs who was seventeen so that he could experience gothdom. He was tired all night, though, and he didn’t seem excited. For a while I sat with Lisie and she told me stories about her family. At one point, a woman recognized me as I walked about. She was of age, there because she knew some of the people who worked the club. She said that I had talked to her on the first floor of C building at HCC, that she’d been the clarinet player. I didn’t have the heart to say, “Which clarinet player that I’ve talked to on the first floor of C building at HCC? I don’t remember you,” so I said, “Oh, yeah! When was that?” “Last semester,” she replied, “When I tried to give you lessons so that you could learn to play the clarinet. ” “Oh yeah!” I remembered, “That didn’t go very well. ” I was in a confident mood, so I was smiling, accepting, clever, and giving strong eye contact. The next thing I knew, the clarinet player was asking me if I had a girlfriend and if I danced. I was intimidated and politely used word games to facilitate an escape back into the safe limbo of talking to minors. I ignore people on the dance floor because in the past I’ve been made fun of for not knowing how to dance with someone in a club setting. I hate games of trying to send the right signals. I saw a group of girls sitting in the corner and talking. I don’t know much about the culture of people who congregate together in single-sex groups except that they usually exclude me, so I walked up and said, “Is this the girl corner? I’m curious what sort of conversation goes on in the girl corner. ” “Actually, we’ve been luring boys over and kissing them,” I was told. “What do you do to lure them over?” “I don’t know, they just come. ” “Wow. That’s a lot of power to wield. ” “But with it comes great responsibility. ” “I see. Do you accept that responsibility, or shirk it?” “Ignore it, mostly. ” Jessica, the most vocal of the group, gave me a kiss on the cheek. It was my second kiss on the cheek of the evening, following one from a boy who wanted to assure me after, “I’m not gay or anything. ” Midway through the evening, there was cake. Jessica convinced me to get a piece for her. Then, when I stole a bite from her fork, she elbowed me in the stomach and I fell to the floor in pain. “My cake!” she said. “Ow… ow,” I replied. “I’ll tell you my life story!” said a girl named Hyacinth as I was trying to get someone else to talk. “Okay,” I said, “Let’s hear it. ” “I’m scared and alone and nobody cares about me and nobody ever will,” she said in one breath. I bombarded her with positive words for the rest of the night. Leaving the Metro, I got on the highway going in the wrong direction, because I’m used to going to the Whately Diner afterwards. So Charlie said, “Okay, let’s stop at Harvey’s. I have to get some stuff, and so does Ben. ” I gave in. While Charlie vanished upstairs with Mike, Erik and Harvey traded stuff through their Pokemon games, and Ben and I sat around. After that, we went to Denny’s in Chicopee. About two dozen people from the club were there. I jumped back and forth between tables so that I could talk to everyone. A girl named Syrma told me about dancing and what it meant to her as a form of expression. Outside, cigarette break, Charlie whispers to me: “The one guy I liked at the club thinks I’m hot. ” “Who?” I asked. “My cigarette is pointing at him. ” I looked and nodded. “He’s of age, too. ” “Okay. ” That was Redhead Alex. Most of the crowd left, and the only ones remaining were me, Charlie, Erik, and Shaved Head Ben, plus a handful of others from the club—Alex, Jen, Tim, and Jessica. Erik and Ben talked in the back table where they’d been most of the night. Charlie was at another table talking with Alex. I was at yet another table with Jen, Tim, and Jessica. Jen’s long-time boyfriend was away. She was talking about worries of keeping things secret when other guys liked her. “Um, it’s certainly not your fault if other guys like you,” I said, confused, “Why should you have to worry about keeping that a secret?” “Well, he gets kind of jealous. ” I looked puzzled, and said, “I don’t get it. ” Tim didn’t say much out of the blue, just responded a little to things that others said. Jessica talked about her compulsion to cuddling, so almost inevitably we cuddled together in the booth. Jen eventually stood up and put on her coat. “We have to go,” she asserted. They left, then, and so did the rest of us, after Charlie had scheduled to meet up with Alex the next day. When Charlie says goodnight to me, it seems like he cuts out the world for a second—as if he can really only see me in those moments. He cares for one second, then leaves. It’s still enough to satisfy me. 46 Rose came into the store. “Consider this a wave-by,” she said. “A wave goodbye?” I asked. “No, like a…” She mimed holding a Tommy gun. “Oh,” I said, “Only more peaceful. Nice. ” “Come see me on your break,” she said. “I’ll think about it,” I replied. She stuck her tongue out. I stuck mine back out at her. Then she ran behind the counter and tickled me. 47 In the dreamworld I held her and cried. Credits rolled to the film. The melody was in the key of E major. I never forgot it. In the dreamworld, all I wanted to do was to talk to someone. But this person’s soul was not present. When I realized this I went into freefall. My surroundings were black with contours of gray. In the dreamworld I realized that a body does not possess a soul. I realized that sometimes a life is not controlled from the future, even if it is spoken to from the future. Sometimes life is just what happens. Sometimes life is an innocent leaf given more potential than could ever be utilized. 48 I woke up in the early afternoon to a phone call from Marie. We talked for a good long while as I gained consciousness. I didn’t really think about it, which wasn’t like me. Usually I find telephone conversations tough, or I stay silent because I can’t think of responses to the words that people speak. But even though it wasn’t particularly deep or meaningful for a conversation between the two of us, it was nice. My vague memory of the early part of the conversation says that she would have liked for us to have hung out today. But I already had plans to see Annie and Carl at some point. Once it was evening I drove to Annie’s place. She had made food, so I had some mashed potatoes, green beans, and sparkling apple cider. Yum! We played a game of checkers. I saw that Annie had an old Nintendo system. She showed off her assortment of games. She was missing some components to hook it up, though, so we couldn’t play. Conversation somehow led to mention of an online purity test, more elaborate than thespark’s. We all took it. Annie got up to go to the bathroom. Then, a knock on the door. It was Nora, Annie’s roommate. “Levi? You have guests,” she said. “Huh?” I said. Charlie and Redhead Alex walked in. As completely random and absurd as it was, it didn’t surprise me for a moment. Charlie hadn’t known that I was there. In fact, he hadn’t even known that Annie lived in the house. Harvey’s house was just a few houses down, and he’d gotten kicked out of there with no transportation. As it turns out, he had known Nora and remembered the house number where she lived. The fact that Annie was her roommate and that I was visiting Annie at the time? Just coincidence. After some lurking about and the consumption of ice cream, we went to the Whately Diner for coffee. Charlie was cute with Alex. It made me happy to see him happy. Charlie and Annie swapped journals. I thought that was strange, because I knew Annie was protective of and secretive with her paper journal: Charlie’s was filled with the same stuff he posted to LiveJournal, but Annie’s was private. After he was done, I asked if I could go through it, too. She let me. It gave me more perspective on her character. I drove Annie and Carl to Annie’s, then Charlie and Alex to Charlie’s. On the highway, Charlie said that Alex was now officially his significant other. Reading Annie’s descriptions of the times we spent in each other’s presence made me feel fulfilled. It was a confirmation that I don’t go unappreciated. Sometimes I worry that hardly anyone will be sensitive to the intricacy of who I am, what I do, what I mean. I worry that my honest efforts aren’t discernible to the naked eye, or something. I am who I am because I know, or hope, or feel, that what I do is going to make a difference somehow… but I never expect that it’ll be beyond a subtle, karmic level. If I expected someone to thank me every time I complimented them, I’m sure I would quickly become so disappointed that I wouldn’t be able to bring myself to offer compliments anymore. So I just try to go through with things. I try to tell people when I’m struck by the good things I see in them. I try to be there for people when I worry about them. And I don’t worry about what I’ll get back, because somewhere along the line, I found faith in knowing that I would be repaid somehow. This faith was founded in desperation, I’m sure, but I’m thankful for it. Every moment means something to me. Every stimulus a person offers, be it a single look or a touch of the hand, is something more for me to smile about the next time I think about them. 49 Friday was the Smashing Pumpkins tribute show at the Flywheel in Easthampton. Conor had been telling me that he really wanted to go, so I picked him up in Longmeadow. I picked him up and he gave me a partial video copy of my play, Memory of a Nightmare, plus Nick P. ’s play that went up along with it, Pinny. It was the final performance, when during Pinny Conor had mixed together a big concoction of foul-smelling liquids into a pot and then dumped it over his head (which then, of course, had spilled out onto the stage, causing actors to slip and fall while the audience made noises of disgust about the horrible stench). Jonny met up with us at the show. The Flywheel is a small, volunteer-run arts space. It was my first time actually going there, but I liked it a lot. There was a seven string (should have been eight string, but one string was missing) mandolin out front. I played “Disarm” on it. Lydia, Moon’s girlfriend, was there. The first band to play seemed inexperienced, but they also seemed to be serious fans of the band whose songs they were playing. They did some nice stuff, including rarities like “Towers of Rabble”. After them, one guy played solo. He offered an enjoyable show with a great setlist. He did “Shame” using just a Casio keyboard, and did a cool arrangement of “Cherry”. Lydia went onstage with him and sang on “Obscured”. The next band was straight-ahead Pumpkins rock stuff, opening with “The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right)”, doing “I Am One” with the rant in the middle, and so on. I wasn’t in the room for the last band, whose set was rather short anyway. All I remember hearing was their cover of “Mayonaise”. A girl remembered me from the Fountains of Wayne concert at Amherst college back in, um, early 2000, I think. People have such good memories. 50 At the party I kept having people I could have sworn I’d never seen before in my life call me by name. “I feel so bad,” I said. “Everybody knows my name, but I’m so bad with names. Why do people always remember me?” I believe it was Laura F. who after this said that I was unique, that I didn’t blend, that I stood out. “But that’s not a bad thing,” she added. When I watched the video of my play last night, I had the same feeling of not understanding myself—not even a feeling of, “That’s me?!” but more like a feeling of, “That’s a human being?!” I have a hard time with thinking of myself as a person like anyone else. This is probably part of why I’m so disinterested in competing with other people. I wish that I could see myself, though. I wish that I could interact with myself. Jonny picked me up in the early evening. We went to Charlie’s house to get his I. D. and cough syrup, then to Fire &amp; Water, where he was waiting for us. We walked from there to the Grotto. The Grotto is a popular gay club that has decided to try out a monthly goth night. We got there early to avoid paying the cover. I purposely didn’t get too comfortable because I knew we’d be moving on to Mick’s party. I socialized a little bit, threw myself into conversations with some people who were in town from Providence, and hung around Kilean and DJ Todd some. There was free water, so I had some of that. Jonny and I eventually managed to drag Charlie out. He had been very set on dancing and spending some time there. We ran into a guy we knew from the days of HCC and Hamlet. I recalled after seeing him that he had previously mentioned his going to the Grotto a lot. Also, a girl who had been at the Pumpkins tribute show the night before waved to us. “It’s the girl from last night,” said Jonny. “What girl from last night?” I asked. “You don’t remember. That’s so great,” said Jonny, amused. After that, we went to Mick’s party. Midway through, I said to a group of people in my vicinity, “Hey, I want to have a deep and meaningful conversation. ” “And you want to do that here?” asked someone, “A deep and meaningful conversation about what?” “The nature of the universe?” suggested someone else. “Sure,” I said proceeding to drag a group of about five people upstairs so that we could discuss the nature of the universe. Then one guy started going off on a tangent about politics. He was a conservative. He started talking about economics. Eventually I grew bored and scratched Annie’s head while she told me about her day. “Have I met him before?” “That’s Luis. No, you haven’t,” said Annie with certainty. “What’s your name?” he asked me. I told him. “Yes, I do remember you,” he replied, “From another time, another world. ” “Through whom?” I asked. “Liv,” he said. “Ahh… Liv,” said Annie. I wasn’t surprised that Annie had known Liv, but it hadn’t been mentioned before. A game of Twister occurred. Charlie stayed on the board the longest. I chatted upstairs for awhile with a girl from HCC. I sadly forget her name, because that’s just the way I am. She said, “You’re one of the HCC snobs!” She was one of the photography people. “Hey!” I called out across the hallway, “Is your name Jay?” “Yes, my name’s Jay,” he replied. “Oh, good. I do remember your name!” I said. There was also another guy there named Jay. I had to ask him what his name was, and he said, “You don’t know my name? I’ve known your name for like two years. ” “Um, yeah, I know, but, um, after a certain point, I just felt bad about asking,” I said. (I first met him at HCC in January ‘98… so I think he’s known my name for three years, actually. ) I talked with Charlie and Laura F. about high school, although of course the two of them had more memories to share than I did. Mine just came down to tales of misery and abuse. Laura F. said she didn’t want to get into her life story, but at least admitted that she had one and said that “everyone’s life story is complicated”—which a lot of people tend to deny, sadly. Jonny had left early. I caught a ride home with Jay (not HCC Jay, although this Jay had gone to HCC for awhile too. This was Jay of local band Collapse into Reason fame. ) He lives in my general area. He was giving Laura F. a ride, too. 51 Audrey called me at some point on Friday and left a message on my answering machine. She said that she had been drinking. She told me that she missed me. Kestrel invited me to a “house-painting party” tomorrow. I forgot about that. And V. told me again that I need to head out to Portland for a visit. Almost embarrassing to say, you know. With her being her and me being me, it’s, um, you know. (“I miss you. ”) Looking at the floor. I can’t believe I just drank a Big Value Party Size Bubba Cola. What kind of a life is this? (The best I’ve ever had. I need to tread softly. ) Scientist Jen emailed me the other night because she didn’t have my phone number. She wanted to hang out. I wonder if she had any specific plans? I need to respond and give her my number. (I keep expecting the carpet to get pulled out from under me, leaving me alone again. This will always happen. No number of lessons learned will ever change that. ) 52 Walking down the street. It’s very slushy. It snowed early this morning. Now, it rains. Cars go, Whoosh! and I get splashed, but only lightly. My coat is wet. Jay from Collapse Into Reason is driving by as I walk. He sees me and stops the car and I think he says something along the lines of, “Get up early today?” It’s about 2 PM Simultaneously I say, “Hey, what are you up to?” and he responds, “Going to practice!” “Ah, wonderful!” I say, “Best of luck to you in that!” Audrey gave me a call this morning. She saw my last entry. “Hello,” she said, “It’s Audrey. How are you?” “I’m doing well, thank you,” I said, “I just woke up. ” “I’m sorry! did I wake you up?” “No, no, you didn’t. Don’t apologize. ” I wasn’t fully awake and my nose was stuffy. I felt bad that I probably wasn’t very entertaining to talk to. “What have you been up to?” I asked. “Drinking,” she responded. “Drinking?” “Drinking. I went to New York with some friends and got a hotel room. ” “Really? What did you go there for?” “To drink. ” 53 I told Nick P (the director of Pinny) that I had a video copy of the one-acts. He became very excited and asked if he could borrow it to make a copy. “I don’t know,” I said, “Can I trust you?” “Of course you can, I see you in here all the time. ” “Ah, but that doesn’t mean I can trust you,” “I’m already not charging you for your coffee and soda. ” “Hmm. Well, that helps a little. ” So in the end I got him to drive me home and I didn’t have to pay for my food in exchange for letting him borrow the video. (I never saw the video again. ) 54 There are plenty of people who sit and scream that the world is stupid and superficial. Personally, I figure that if I put in the effort to keep my ways and viewpoints around—not shoving them upon anyone, just letting them be seen through friendships and interactions—and if at the same time I care enough to keep my friends close, this is the best I’ll be able to do. (So, how is Levi Adams? asks a whisper from the future. ) Levi Adams is good. (Oh, good. ) Yup. (Tell me about how life’s been for you recently. ) Okay. My last semester at HCC was a strange time. In retrospect, I don’t understand where all the time went, at least during September and October. Apparently, I managed to stay content by lurking around school every day until late in the afternoon, then going home and chatting until I felt like going to sleep. I worked some nights. I hung out with Jonny once in awhile. That was pretty much it. I broke up with Sarah N. during the first week of classes. I talked to just about everyone I came across, which is why I still meet so many people who say, “You randomly talked to me one time at HCC!” I didn’t have much in the way of steady companions while I was there, just floated… I had very little in the way of rest while preparing for, and putting up, my play. The play completely absorbed my life. Actually, this isn’t entirely true. I started going to Haven more regularly around then, with Liv and Sarah H. And I met Moon just before preparations for my play began. Moon was helpful in the run-up to my play, but we stopped hanging out so much after that. November 28 to December 9 was like one big long day to me. That was the time from when I left for Chicago to the final night of my play. After that? I think I planned for something big to happen to me. I expected to be sucked into some crazy new world. Maybe I would run off to somewhere far away, I thought. Maybe I would have a significant lifestyle change. Really I just sat around my apartment, walked a lot, went out for coffee a lot. New Year’s Eve wasn’t a big deal like it usually was. I did begin to feel a change, and that change would continue, but it was very gradual—very subtle. I wrote a lot of songs, recorded demos, continued going out for coffee. That age-old idea of starting a rock band always seemed in reach, as suddenly I found myself getting proposals left and right. But it never really came together. A lot of people seemed like they were drifting away at that time, but of course, I was also still clinging to optimism as much as I could. Life had dealt me periods of blandness before, and I had always found some escape. I just had no idea what was going to happen this time. The escape from this particular rut came in the form of Charlie. He inspired me because I had absolutely no idea what to think of him. He was a connection to my past, since we had gone to the same high school and he had somehow remembered me. I was always looking for ways to connect disconnected parts of my past and present, so I thought this was wonderful. I wasn’t able to understand his motivations, so his ways gave me something to be curious about. He had a large presence, so that you could love him, hate him, or just be made uneasy by him, but you couldn’t ignore him. Adventure-seeker that I was, I’d been wishing to meet more people of that nature. He had his own world that I was able to sink into. It was adventure. I started delving into feelings from the past that I had left behind. That was when I started trying to put my history with V. into perspective. It’s a strange way that’s led Charlie to make me a better person, but he’s done it. He left for his road trip, and I still remained in a world of… things happening. By the time he came back, I was feeling more capable of standing on my own. Again there were problems in getting comfortable around him, but when I was uncomfortable I was pushing more to try and settle things. Audrey came to visit and we shared a wonderful weekend that was like a reward to me. But working out the nature of our relationship was going to be tough. She left sooner than I’d expected, seemingly in a rush, saying outright that there were things she wasn’t telling me. Speaking in the present tense, I still haven’t seen her since. I’m trying to maintain the wonderful feeling of living and growing with people on my side, watching the people I care about live and grow themselves, helping however I can. I’m happy where I am. I’ve thought about it and I will go on record as saying that I don’t need or wish for an intense relationship from anyone at this moment. I need love: we all need love. I’m just not willing to settle into obligations when I know inside that a committed relationship wouldn’t last. And I hope that the people in my life whom I’ve been fortunate enough to meet will continue to be there for me, because I fully intend to be there for them through whatever it takes them to get where they’re going. I want to gain control of my own life, to make decisions that will place me decidedly on the path to where I want to be. 55 Driving up to Northampton. “Can you turn the light on for a second?” asks Charlie. “No,” I respond. “Why not?” “Because I’m merging out onto the highway. Okay, now I can turn the light on. ” I turn the light on. I don’t pay attention to what he’s doing. I figure he’s putting on glitter. Stopped at a stoplight after the highway ends, he knocks over his lunchbox. He opens the door and steps out. “What are you doing?” I ask. “Looking for the cover to my glitter,” he says. The light turns green. I tell him to get back into the car. He does. He finds the cover to his glitter. Crisis averted. At Fire &amp; Water for the open stage night. A woman I met at Word on Wednesday walks in. “I remember you!” I say proudly. “Do you remember my name?” she asks. “Um… she just said it!” I say, pointing to Kim, who had greeted her upon her entry, “So, what she said!” But then I forced myself to remember it—Carrie. Utilizing the replacement guitar strings that I had finally bought earlier in the day, I performed. I did “The Fall of Spring”, citing the fact that the weather seemed to finally be moving out of the freezing range as a reason for its appropriateness. Then I said, “Um, well, we have a percussive instrument sitting up here. So, does anyone want to come up and play with me for this next song?” A guy who calls himself Just Dan came up and accompanied me while I played “Last Life”. We were out of sync most of the time, but hey, at least I tried. After that, audience participation became a running theme. Just Dan also played with the next performer… and another guy with a percussive instrument walked up from the audience and asked to join them on the second song. The guy after that joked about the audience participation aspect, and midway through his second song said, “Okay, here’s where you all can clap along. ” Then up next was a four-piece, and Star (F&amp;W owner and the open stage M. C. ) began playing drums midway through. Jonny came. We went to Denny’s and ate. Jonny was chipper. Charlie was uncomfortable there, noting that random customers were mumbling bad things about him again. I dropped him off and went home. "

    "body": "56 Jonny picked me up. His long, blond hair was sculpted into two tails sticking directly outward from the back. It was a mess of glue, with wire sticking out and wrapping around it. I couldn’t go out on the deck at Haven. No one could. Apparently the key had broken off in the lock, so the club was going to need to get a locksmith. It was a bad night for this to happen: the club was packed. It was Mardi Gras night. A gothic Mardi Gras? Yes. An excuse for exhibitionism. Some scattered people gave me bead necklaces. In turn I passed them on to others, because I didn’t feel like wearing them. Harvey said he was pissed at Charlie because he’d gone to his place the other night at 4 AM, uninvited, and slept there. He said also that Charlie was pissed that he was pissed. Liv was there. I hadn’t seen Liv in a long time. “How have you been?” she asked. “I’ve been very well. I’m getting better and better with time,” I said. Penelope announced that she wanted all willing parties to head to the back stage for a large synchronized unveiling of breasts. I kind of hoped that I would find some people who were disgusted with these proceedings to talk with during the fiasco. Not because I don’t like breasts, but… the idea of nudity for shock value, the idea of women unveiling themselves as a rush… I knew that it would bug me. I wandered around toward the back stage. Next to me were several overexcited guys. Guy-like guys, behaving like guys. As usual, I kept trying to steal Kestrel’s stuffed friend of the night anytime I saw him. I talked to someone who had just taken some ecstasy and also was going to have to babysit in the morning. Hm. After that, I found true happiness. I found it because I started playing with a balloon, hitting it into the air. I managed to get other people involved in keeping it airborne. After having been around one woman for about ten minutes or so, having hugged her and conversed with her, in a gap between rounds of a balloon game she was participating in, I looked at her chest and walked forward. “Hey! You’re topless!” I said. “You’re just noticing this now?” “I’m just noticing this now!” I giggled. “You can touch them if you want, I don’t care. ” “No, thank you,” I said. Annie was sitting down. She was excited because she was borrowing bunny ears, and she’s a fuzzy bunny. I was excited because of the balloon game. We hugged and scratched each other’s head. After a lot of people had left, I talked to Rachel, a person from Mick’s crowd, who was sitting alone. I sat and talked to Jay from Collapse Into Reason. “I hate drama,” he said. “Really?” I said, “I love being surrounded by drama. ” “I’m just here trying to stay far away from the drama. ” “Oh, okay,” I said, “I’m going to go look for some drama. ” I drove Jonny, Charlie, and Annie to Whately in Jonny’s car. It was a long wait for a table. “I’m feeling more tired than I should be,” said Annie. “I’m not sure if I’m feeling tired, so much, but I’m a little sad,” I said. “Yeah, that too,” she responded, “I don’t like to be sad. ” We cuddled some as we waited for food. I utilized such clever methods of trying to initiate conversation as, “So! Did you guys ever have Power Wheels? You know, pow-pow-Power Wheels!” We dropped off Annie. I talked to Charlie some more about Redhead Alex. Jonny dropped him off. He dropped me off. I walked upstairs. 57 Fire &amp; Water. Sitting at the counter. A couple of hours left to February. “And how about you, Levi Adams?” Kim asks, “How are you doing?” “I’m well. I’m usually doing well,” I say. “I thought so. You have that look about you. It’s the I’m really together, I’m Levi Adams, I’m creative, artistic, content kind of look. ” “Wow, really?!” I enthuse, “That’s great! I had no idea. ” Then, in contrast, Kathy (known to me from HCC) says to me as soon as she sees me, “Are you sad? You look sad. ” 58 The outside of Selser Elementary School. “Mediate instead of hate,” reads a printed-out banner. “Stop, step back, cool down, apologize, talk it out,” say a series of other displays. Tracks of some sort in the snow make the shape of two hearts, side-by-side. I can’t tell whether this is intentional or not. “No trespassing. Violators are subject to arrest and will be prosecuted. ” “No trespassing. ” “No trespassing after dark. ” I get the point. And I’m still here. I have to be somewhere, and it may as well be here. Two schools, a field between. Together they teach grades K-6. Car. Cop. His light is shining in my face, of course. So that he can see me, but I can’t see him. “What are you doing?” he demands. “I was sitting and writing,” I say. His voice is condescending, like a big brother mocking his sibling’s games of pretend. “Sitting and writing at five in the morning? Have you heard of sleep?” “I have an awkward sleep schedule,” I reply. My look is sincere. “Did you walk here all the way from the 7-11?” he asks. I realize that he’s the same officer who had been watching Charlie and me closely as we’d stopped there to buy soda. “No, I’m parked at Bernie’s Dining Depot. I walked from there. ” “Were you at the other school, too?” “Briefly, yes. ” “See, I followed the footprints from there. You can’t be hanging out here. It’s trespassing, there are signs all over that say that. You hang around here and you get arrested. If you’re going to sit and write, you have to find somewhere else to do it. ” “I understand. It won’t happen again. ” “All right,” he says. I walk. I light a cigarette. He pulls up beside me. “What happened to your two friends?” he asks me. “I dropped them off at home. ” “Okay, so they’re not here with you?” “No, they’re not. ” He hesitates. “Well…” He stops to think. He feels like he should be doing something more. “I don’t know if you’re an author, or if you just need time to yourself…” “I’ve been writing for a long time,” I say. “Well, okay, but you can’t be here, you can’t be at Bernie’s, anything that’s city property or privately owned. ” “Actually,” I say, “My mother works at Bernie’s, so I know the people there. I stopped in and one of the employees was there. He knows me, I asked if I could park and he said it was fine. ” My innocence grows greater with every question he asks. He asks me if I’ve ever been arrested. I say no. He asks me where I live. I tell him. He asks me my name, I tell him. He writes it down. I move on. He doesn’t bother me again. 59 Never before in history have so many words been written: I exist. 60 Talking to my mother: “I hate it when people feel the need to tell me how the weather’s going to be! If something like a snowstorm happens and you don’t know it’s coming, Then it’s an adventure. In the end it could be good or bad. But if you spend days anticipating a snowstorm and telling yourself in advance that you’re going to be snowed in, it’s disrupting your life even before the storm starts!” 61 It begins. I step outside and there’s no question about it. The breeze is light, so in the darkness I don’t get the impression of anything other than a pretty snowfall. But I can feel the heaviness of the snow, I can see it begin to accumulate, and I know that it’s more. I think of my childhood. An old memory, one that I had lost for a time. A kid named Matt’s 7th birthday party. Miguel played outside and proclaimed that a play area was “Miguel’s Supermarket!” I ran up and asked, “Do you have any potatoes?” “Uhh… potatoes?” he said, looking confused. I laughed and laughed at the way that he said that. The neighbors here have their wind chimes up. From them I can hear a melody as steady as one belonging to a music box. I think of when I once hurried out with V. onto her back patio to investigate the sound of a loud crash in the middle of the night. The wind had knocked over a cabinet of ornaments, which her father had placed out there. V. knelt down and picked up broken fragments of a musical decoration. She turned the key. Weakly, sadly, it played “Little Drummer Boy”. When I remember my childhood, then remember how it felt to experience love, and life, for the first time, I feel that it’s all the same. Each snowflake can drift for only so long before falling to rest where it may. It preserves its unique form, only to fall atop banks of its ancestors. But so long as there’s winter, old memories drift again, another beautiful singularity… for the span of a fall, from the sky to the ground. 62 At work, a kid who must have been about thirteen started insulting me: “You’re not even treating me like a customer! I know this store better than you do!” As I rang up the game he was buying, I made a sad face and asked, “Do you hate me?” “Yes,” he said. “Why?” I asked. “Because you don’t play Everquest!” The phone rang. He said, “The phone’s ringing! Hurry up and bag my game! You’d better answer it!” I glared at him as I slid his purchase into the bag extra slowly. Haven at Club Metro was sparsely populated due to snows. Inspired by Charlie’s lunchbox, Mick started a sing-along of the Fraggle Rock theme. Lori, Brian and I were going to head out to the deck to build a snowman, but the lock still wasn’t fixed, so we couldn’t. The first thing Rachel asked me was whether I remembered her name. “I know it, but I’m too afraid to say it. So, confirm my suspicions,” I said. “No, I’m going to make you say it. ” “Okay… does it have an A in it?” “Yes. ” “An R?” Jonny walked up. “Her name’s Rachel,” he said. “Aw,” I said, “I knew that!” I talked to Jonny, standing next to him. Then he walked away. I shrugged. I noticed two women sitting directly to the front of me, saying nothing to each other or anyone else, looking bored. So I walked up and said, “Hello, strangers. ” One of them remained silent; the other responded. I started talking to the one who acknowledged my presence. She recognized me and knew that I worked at the mall. She said that she was bored. I explained that my personal solution for boredom was talking to strangers. She said that it was okay that I was talking to her, she was just shy. I asked her why she was shy. She didn’t answer. I did get her to share some of her life story before she left to dance, or to run away from me, or whatever she left for. I talked with Charlie. He was talking to a woman who, though she was older than I, said that she remembered my riding the same bus as her in high school. After Charlie left, I was talking with this woman for a minute when Harvey and his crew started shouting from the corner. As I recall, the first thing Harvey yelled was, “Hey, are you gay?” Charlie and Jonny wanted to go to Denny’s, so we did. No one else showed up there. In the middle of a conversation, Charlie said, “Levi had his tongue in my throat! He was drunk. ” “I didn’t initiate the tongue, though, you did,” I said, “I just kissed you, but it wasn’t just a quick peck, it was more sustained. So I think you instinctively brought tongues into play at that point. And I went with it. ” “Everybody says that,” he said, “Brian and Alex said the same thing. I thought they were the ones who started with the tongues, but they said that I did it. ” Later, I returned to the subject for a moment: “I didn’t just kiss you because I’d been drinking, you know. I kissed you because I felt like kissing you. ” “I know,” he said. He brought up Audrey at some point. Jonny asked what he was talking about. “You didn’t tell Jonny about Audrey?” he asked. “He doesn’t tell me shit,” said Jonny. 63 Charlie is wearing my shirt. He’s playing music loudly. The dirty light of the day filters through the window into his mom’s house. He taps his foot and sings along to rock music. He types something. He walks quickly to look out the window. “Do you want coffee?” he screams so that he can be heard over the music. “Yes!” I scream in reply. 64 Charlie’s mother is wearing an Eeyore shirt. His brother says he was just fired from his custodial job. 65 High school memories make me sad. I lie in Charlie’s lap and look at yearbooks. 66 Later I lie with my head on his belly and take a semi-nap as we ride the bus from Amherst to Northampton. We go to the Haymarket for coffee. The nap rejuvenates me. The darkness helps, too. I feel excited. 67 At Fire &amp; Water. Carrie comes over as she sees me sitting a musician play. She asks how I’ve been and I start to respond. Charlie comes over and inserts himself into the dialogue. Carrie says that she’ll be over at the counter area. “I hope I didn’t ruin your magic moment,” says Charlie. Charlie and I still aren’t sure where we’re going after this. By the time we’re ready to leave it’s too late for taking buses in the direction of Chicopee. Carrie extends the offer that we go to her dorm. 68 An unnecessarily eventful evening follows, as always seems to happen when I would do best to sleep. Carrie is a student at Smith College. She lives alone in a dorm room. We walk there from Fire &amp; Water. Carrie wants me to teach her the guitar. She’s been trying to learn, but lately is lacking inspiration. I try. Meanwhile, Charlie is at the computer, talking about how angry he is at his boyfriend. I think he’s uncomfortable, for how much she interrupts Carrie and/or me. We look up tablature for “Anna Begins” by Counting Crows. I play while Carrie sings. Charlie says he wants to have a cigarette, so we go downstairs into a lounge room where smoking is allowed. Some other folks are there. I’m getting tired, but when we return to the room Carrie insists that we practice some more. I make clear the fact of my desire to sleep, but we keep playing and after another smoke break we move to a living room area and watch Saturday Night Live. I’m dozing off on Charlie. Back in the dorm room, Carrie again tells me to play. I do, stumbling through. Finally, sleep comes. 69 Sitting in the smoking room. Smith girls chat. “So where do you want to go next week?” “Somewhere on the west coast. ” “You want to go to the west coast?” “We can go on the east coast if you want. ” Then they talk about visiting Mexico. I tried to leave when Charlie decided to shower. I want some food, but not college breakfast food. I don’t know what I’ll be able to find on a Sunday in Northampton. I was told not to leave. Apparently Charlie wants my company until Redhead Alex meets him at Fire &amp; Water. I wonder why I let myself be commanded on these few occasions when I desire to do a specific thing for myself. 70 I walked Charlie to Fire &amp; Water. Alex was waiting outside. I said my goodbyes. Following this I walked to the tobacco store and bought cigarettes. Then I came here, to Angelina’s Pizzeria. I like this place. It’s not usually very busy, there’s a lot of open space. Ceiling fans make for good air circulation. Plus, they now carry Jolt Cola. Still, I’m going to move onward. 71 Carrie called, according to Kim, and said for me to sign us up on the list for the open stage. I don’t know when she’ll be arriving so that we can prepare. I sit on Main Street, some distance from F&amp;W. We ran into Amy, an ex-HCC student, outside of Haymarket. Jonny and I always seem to run into her. 72 Carrie and I perform “Anna Begins”. Then I play my new song, “Flight of the Angel”, on my own. Sarah N. comes in. She says hello to me when I say hello to her, then proceeds to concentrate on talking to Jonny. “Yeah, you need to give me a call sometime,” she says to Jonny as I stand there. She leaves without a goodbye, without a look in my direction. 73 Charlie was very quotable tonight before falling asleep in my bed: “On the ride home all I could think of was, ‘I can’t wait to get to the house and cuddle with you, because you’re my substitution for my boyfriend when he’s not around. ’ And now I’m here and my mood just changed, and now I don’t feel like cuddling. Well, not with you. I mean, no, it’s not like that. You can cuddle with me if you want to. I just don’t feel like… cuddling with you. But your leg is kind of heavy. My jeans are cutting into my leg. ” Also: “I don’t know why you don’t have a girlfriend. You’re attractive… and you have a great personality… and everyone likes you. ” I gave Phil kisses on the cheek tonight and told him that he looked sad. “I’m usually sad,” he replied. “So every time that I see you, should I be kissing you on the cheek and telling you to be happy?” I asked. “It might help,” he replied. After the club, I drive Charlie, Annie, and Rachel to Whately. “Is it okay if I cuddle?” Annie asks me. “Of course!” I reply. She lies on me. I scratch her head. “Hey Levi!” Harvey calls out from two booths behind, repeating what he’d done at the club a week or two prior, “Are you a homosexual?” I act as if deep in thought, finding myself completely incapable of formulating an appropriate response. “Are we in the seventh grade?” replies Rachel for me. Annie leaves early. Mike gives her a ride home. “So where did you come from?” asks Rachel, “One day you just suddenly appeared. ” “Yeah, that happens with Levi,” Hank says, “He just appears one day, and then he’s everywhere, and then it’s like he’s always been everywhere. ” “I probably just saw you one day and asked for your life story,” I say to Rachel. “Yeah, you did. But I never heard your life story. We’re at a diner, we have cigarettes and coffee, so go for it. ” So I begin. Charlie runs up to the table and cuts me off while I’m talking. “Do you think you could help me out with paying for my food?” “I don’t have any extra money, I’m sorry. ” Again he interrupts me a couple minutes later: “What if… you gave me eight dollars?” “If I gave you eight dollars, I would be in another permutation or something, because I only have seven dollars, and that’s all going towards paying for my food. I’m sorry. ” I never finish my life story. Charlie says he wants to leave, and I see the others’ eyes starting to get heavy. 74 I’m going to Fire &amp; Water for the weekly Open Mic Poetry reading. I got a couple of calls the other day, from Conor, because he was interested in going. He said that Alice would like to come along too. And I assume that Jonny’s going to want to go; while I was talking to Alice after the play at HCC last Thursday he walked up and realized that he recognized her and that they had taken a workshop together or something a while back. So he’ll probably want to come hang out with her. I’ll call and pose the option to him. I don’t feel incredibly drawn to the idea of driving to Longmeadow, but if Jonny wants to play chauffeur tonight that would be fine. Delphine wanted to do something today; but since I’m not able to use the car before this evening, we have to postpone it. She said that she wanted to do something this week, since it’s her vacation, so I want to remember to try and get in touch with her before this weekend. 75 Things seemed fine before we left. He’d slept over the night before, we’d woken up, gotten ready, and left for Northampton. When Jonny showed up and met us at Fire &amp; Water, though, Charlie just started badmouthing me. I excused myself so that I could go for a walk and was yelled at for doing so. On the way out I was distracted by Brian and Lori, who happened to be walking down the street at the time. I was overwhelmed by feelings that I didn’t know what to do with. I had nowhere to go. I just wanted for the attacks to stop and for the sticky film of negativity to fall away. I walked to the convenience store and bought a lighter, Fig Newtons and a soda. I sat outside and wrote. I walked back to Fire &amp; Water to drop off my soda before moving on to Haymarket. I placed it by Charlie. He half-hugged me. I half-accepted. Alice hugged me. I told her that I wasn’t feeling well, that I was going to Haymarket to get away for a bit, but that I’d be back. After going to Haymarket and writing there, I walked back to Fire &amp; Water. Outside I had a conversation with someone who seemed to know me and the people I knew, although I couldn’t remember ever having met her in my life. She asked me if I was all right. I told her that I was. She told me that Charlie had left. Kim told me that Jonny had left along with Charlie. I sat down with Conor, Alice, and someone named Kat, whom Alice has I guess been on a couple of dates with. All this pleasant company cheered me up. Sarah N. came in briefly, only speaking to me to ask if Jonny was there. I delivered what I think was my personal best so far in poetry/prose reading. Conor read as well, his first time ever doing such a thing. Kat went to catch the bus; Alice accompanied her while she waited for it. I decided that I didn’t want the night to end at Fire &amp; Water. I asked Alice and Conor if they were up for an adventure, and they said yes. I agreed I’d drive them home; they called to tell Alice’s mother not to come to pick them up as originally planned. Walking to the car, Conor mentioned that his friend Daniel lived within walking distance, so we went there. Also hanging out with Daniel were his girlfriend Lisa and a guy named John. They were watching Friends when we entered. We had a lengthy discussion about capitalism. I played Tetris on the computer and beat the high score. From there we went to the Whately Diner. We all stuffed ourselves. I was feeling good. Even Kelly the Waitress, who is often somber, was in a really good mood. 76 Charlie called me at work to apologize. I’m not used to apologies. I didn’t know what to say. 77 For years I had been in the habit of compiling my writings and uploading them to a web site. Now that most of my writing time was devoted to LiveJournal posts, it seemed natural for me to compile those entries into collections. So it happened that I started thinking about the story of my life as a series of books I might title along the way. "

    "body": "1 In the public restroom, my hair in waves, layer upon layer, I see the big clumps, dark, concealing the outline of my face, averting light. I see my eyes. 2 (Playing softly on my guitar inside the Port Authority. ) 3 After a long stretch of non-stop highway, almost five hours. Truck stop, scales, diesel pumps, the whole deal, just a little break where a meal stop would be appreciated. Wanting to conserve money, I only purchase a twenty-five cent bag of popcorn. The woman in front of me is charged for it anyway, so I don’t even pay for that. Sitting since New York next to a nice woman who, seeing my guitar, says that she’s a musician too, asks me if I play rock music. I shrug. She says that the woman she works with doesn’t like describing her work by any genre either: “It’s just music. ” I’m cramped. Hoping for a seat of my own once we begin adventuring through the states that I haven’t seen yet. I’m smoking as much as I can. I’m not sure whether we’ll be stopping again before Cleveland. 4 I may have misplaced my mini carrying pouch, which contains my razor, toothbrush, etc. I’m not positive, though… it’s difficult to rummage through my stuff while I’m sitting here on the bus. I’ll find out for certain in Chicago. 5 Looking up from my writing, I notice a young couple kissing. “Yay, a public show of affection!” I enthuse, “Take it on tour!” My silly joy is misplaced outside of the bus terminal in Cleveland. The couple, and the other strangers standing around, wait for a punchline. I only smile. “Is that a nice way of saying, ‘Get a room?’” asks the girl. “Not at all,” I reply, “It’s more like, ‘Right on, I’m sick of being told to get a room when I’m in the same situation. ’” Impressed, she shakes my hand, introducing herself, her boy, and their friend. She’s coming from Oregon, where she’s been staying with a man she met over the Internet, who neglected to mention to her that he was married. She somehow had ended up with a man whom her boy described as “a redneck”, who had proposed marriage after one day of knowing her. But, at the bus terminal in Omaha, her now-boy asked her out and went with her in place of “the redneck”. (This boy is originally from North Carolina. ) The friend is from San Diego; while in Omaha, he was talked into coming along with the two of them to the girl’s home in Pittsburgh. I sit and talk with them awhile. They have a cuddle pile for a bit. A random older guy who’s been talking with them offers to smoke me up. I politely decline. I reboard the bus to Chicago. The Amish people here claim to have been on the bus before, but they’re lying. Silly Amish people, thinking that they deserve special treatment just because they wear spiffy hats. 6 Almost to Chicago, I smile, remembering the last time when I was there: I met Jacqui from San Francisco. There I was, chatting excitedly when Socks came and met me. I suppose my Western Massachusetts dealings ended well. The way I saw it, there was only one loose end—Robyn, dancer and choreographer, who liked to sit on hills with me. (I happened to be watching when her name was called. She walked to the stage. She said that she was new to the area. She had arrived alone at Fire &amp; Water. She was offered a microphone. “No thanks, I’m good at projecting. ” She smiled. Who was she? Later, I was outside. She was walking by. “Hey, I wanted to tell you,” I said, “That was a great performance. ” She stopped walking, stood to talk with me. We moved to a booth inside. I was facing the door; she was facing the stage. She had just moved here from Chicago thanks to the benevolence of someone I had once taken a class with. “I’m projecting all over you,” Robyn said to me, “I should write a list of all the things that I’m projecting onto you. ” “Yes, please,” I said, but I never did receive that list. Charlie and Tina entered the café, sat down in the booth, introduced themselves to Robyn and chatted with her excitedly. When it was time for everyone to leave I exchanged contact info with Robyn. On the ride home, Charlie said to Tina, “Isn’t Robyn cool!” “Yeah,” said Tina, “I’m glad that we met her. Did you meet her, Levi?”… The next time I saw Robyn she was talking about her magic in ways that most people make sure not to. Then, after Tina and I were no longer dating, I would find Robyn with her and Charlie frolicking down the streets of Northampton. The first time I wrote about Robyn in LiveJournal was after a “Gothic BBQ” with a bunch of folks. Robyn and I followed Mick, in theory to walk to the 7-11. That was when the three of us ended up lying in the grass and chatting. Returning to the BBQ, I found that Charlie and Tina were upset that we had disappeared. They were insisting that I give them a ride and let them stay over. Mick took me aside and said to me, “I don’t really want to have Tina and Charlie over tonight, but I’m doing this as a favor to you. Take that girl, Robyn, home with you. ” What happened was close enough to that: she took me to where she was living, a bedroom in the home of the woman who had taken her in here. ) There was that brief period during which Tina dated Harvey.  That lasted for like three days. She later would emphasize to everyone that they hadn’t slept together. Charlie had his thing with Mick, of course. And I forget exactly what Tina was up to at the time, whom she was with or whatever, but eventually Charlie conspired with Bill (the guy Tina had left before coming out to the Valley) by telling him that he should come to visit. He did, as a bid to rescue Tina from the chaos of her new life. That was how Bill appeared on the streets of Northampton. I knew in advance that he was going to show up, but I didn’t drop any hints to Tina about it. I got to watch as Tina was just there chatting casually with people on the street when her old flame from Boston was suddenly there. This progressed into a drunken night at my apartment: me, Charlie, Harvey, Tina, and Bill. Charlie, Harvey and I took a walk to the 7-11. We cut through my (and Charlie’s) old high school, climbing a fence in order to get through. When we returned to the apartment, Tina and Bill were intertwined. “This feels like we’re in the closing chapter of a book!” somebody exclaimed. I kept drinking while the conversation continued. I eventually got sick, hunched over my kitchen wastebasket. “Harveeeeey!” I whined, “I need some waaaater!” and I listened while Bill was saying to him, “Sure, be free to love and all that, but did she have to come out here and sleep with the kid?” Tina and Bill went through some sort of brief attempt at getting back together again, but it didn’t work out. 7 Our bus pulls in late to the Chicago terminal. I’m told that I now have a seven hour wait before I can catch my transfer. I sit outside with my guitar, performing songs to myself. Wanting to buy cigarettes, I stick my bag in a locker and walk. About six blocks away I find a Walgreen’s drug store, buy the smokes, then explore the shopping center. I sit in front of a video rental store. The employees are getting ready to open for the day. I’m writing a song called “No Standing”, inspired by a street sign. A homeless kid about my age strikes up conversation. He tells me stories about this city and keeps pointing to the Sears Tower. He tags along with me to a supermarket, where I give him change towards a meal of pudding and grapefruit soda. Meanwhile, I sip coffee. We hang out there for about an hour and a half, watched and listened to by a security guard. I tell the homeless kid I’m going to use the restroom, do so, then exit the store into the wet and dreary outside. I don’t look back. 8 These rides make a person numb. One could expect, or at least hope for, some spiritual revelation, some secret of the great escape, but really you just want to make it to the next stop, then once you’re there you want to make it to the cream and sugar for your coffee without having to think too hard on it. 9 I look up from playing guitar inside the Chicago terminal to see a woman standing and looking in my direction. Of course, I am intimidated by any energy that anyone sends my way, ever, so I look down and let it go as an awkward moment. She approaches me, though, and asks me where I’m going. I explain as best I can. She says that she’s going home to Minnesota after getting stuck in New York. She left because of a fight with someone, she says. I ask if it was so bad a dispute that she really had to flee the state. She says that he tried to kill her twice, “The police don’t want to do the paperwork now, fine, they’ll do the paperwork when they find my dead body. ” I say that her solid concept of what a home is to her is admirable, that she’s going back in spite of these things. She says, “Well, where have you been? No matter where you go, you always end up home again, right?” I stumble for words and she claims her victory. “I think I’m too young to yet be able to generalize about things like that, though,” I argue. “Why, how young are you?” “Twenty. ” “Yeah, you are too young. Way too young,” she says, grabbing her things and walking away immediately. I return to playing guitar. 10 Through Madison, Wisconsin, thought to myself: “What a great lake! Wait a minute…” 11 The bus driver says he forgot some papers he’s supposed to have at all times while driving the bus, so we have a wait ahead of us. What’s already going to be the longest trip of my life thus far (81 hours, including the time that I was set back in Chicago) might well be even longer now. (Didn’t this same thing happen to me on the way back from seeing The Smashing Pumpkins, back in October? No, wait. I actually remembered and wrote about that incorrectly. The bus actually broke down, that time. Huh. ) 12 I overhear the bus driver saying that he’s going to have to wait here until the wee hours of the morning, when the next bus out of Chicago can come by and drop off the papers that he left there. All I can say is, damn. I guess we’re just waiting a couple hours until a bus gets here from Minneapolis, to take us to Minneapolis. I don’t know what this is going to do to the rest of my schedule. Flashback. Before leaving town, I went to Electronics Boutique to find Shawn—the Assistant Manager—working. I stood around looking like I needed to say something. “Um. I’m leaving,” I said. “Okay. When?” “In an hour. ” “All right, that shouldn’t be a problem. We knew it was coming. ” (I had told Rich that I was planning to leave town soon. ) “I figured it wouldn’t be a hassle. That’s the only reason I’m giving such short notice. It’s just four hour shifts for the next couple Fridays that’ll need to be filled. ” “Well, thank you for letting us know. Most people probably would have just left. It’s been a pleasure working with you. Good luck. ” He shook my hand and I left. 13 A man ten years older than my father. He says that it’s his first time on a bus since the age of seven. He relates tales of all the people he’s watched. He then proceeds to talk about politics to me. He’s Catholic and a conservative. He keeps saying things like, “I’m not a judgmental person at all…” I go into the McDonald’s. The employees are taking orders, even though the register has been shut down for the night. They’re keeping track of the transactions on a notepad. I see the new bus driver pull up while I’m lighting a cigarette for the man who has two metal claws for hands. To Minnesota… and beyond! 14 Okay, so I was wrong. That wasn’t actually our bus. We’re still stranded. 15 According to my calculations, after this trip I will have spent approximately one month, cumulatively, of my past three years on Greyhound bus trips. That’s 1/36 of my time. 16 What do I know about love? I know that love is a true thing, you know, and perhaps I… Woohoo! The bus driver is here! Yippee! (Inside the first, stranded bus, I hope that my using the overhead light doesn’t disturb anybody. ) Um, where was I? Somewhere deep. Um. Well, Audrey and I had our one day and night together back in… March, I think? And I wanted to get to know her better, to see her again, but I knew she had her life in eastern Mass. , while I had mine in the Pioneer Valley. But I wanted to make absolutely certain that our physical distance from each other didn’t lead her to believe that I didn’t really care for her, think about her, want to know her… Anyway, again I’m still stranded. Half the passengers were just loaded onto another bus that’s heading to Minneapolis. The rest of us remain, waiting for another bus that should be here within “fifteen to twenty minutes”. 17 I talk with a girl from London who is traveling the States with a friend of hers. I get her to tell me her life story, although she unfortunately doesn’t go into much detail. Another bus driver instructs a trucker to move his vehicle. The trucker threatens physical harm, so the driver calls the police. 18 Another bus—an otherwise empty one—appears while I’m not paying attention. We’re told to board it. We do. Kate from London says she’s homesick. 19 If nothing in the time that remains of my trip pushes me further off-schedule I will arrive in Portland, Oregon at 5 PM on Friday—quite a bit later than the 10:15 AM on Thursday that is listed on my ticket. This will make me a total of 30. 75 hours late, having survived a 104. 75 hour long trip. The Customer Service Representative in Minneapolis says that all he can do is give me a free meal voucher, “Of value not to exceed $5. 00. ” Yes, ladies and gentlemen: a day and a quarter in the life of Levi Adams, of value not to exceed $5. 00. 20 I am at approximately the halfway point of my journey—again, assuming the best. What I went through to get this cup of coffee was an adventure in itself. Ugh. Time for another cigarette in the smokers’ isolation area. 21 Minneapolis surprisingly seemed like a very nice city. I’m not sure why I imagined that it wouldn’t be. The surrounding areas to the city were also nice; somehow, I kept thinking that my mother would like it there. Our next stop is Fargo. I wonder why Kate from London and her fellow adventurer aren’t on this bus, considering that that had originally been their destination. Maybe it was the fact that when she told me they were from London and going to Fargo I got a confused expression on my face and asked the guy going to British Columbia if there was anything to be seen in Fargo. “Uh, people getting put into wood chippers?” he smiled, referencing the movie named after that town. Good luck to the British people, then, wherever they’ve run off to. Sleep just comes in little naps. I haven’t really crashed yet for longer than three hours at a time. Hm. We’re on a one-lane highway. Maybe we are in North Dakota already. Nah, we’re approaching Brainerd. “EXCITING Brainerd Lakes Area!” reads a sign. I guess it could be exciting to… visit the National Guard Armory… go to church… work out at the gym… walk down the sidewalk… walk some more down the sidewalk… buy sandwiches… buy gas… get a haircut at the barber shop… Wait! Packs of Marlboros for $2. 92? Wow! The Brainerd Lakes Area is “EXCITING”! 22 Fargo, North Dakota. I talk with a guy who has a mental disability, who is traveling from Queens to work at Yellowstone National Park. Someone laughs when a Fargo police department cruiser rolls by. Rain begins to drizzle. More people are boarding the bus. Here’s hoping that none of them sit next to me… Oh, well. I’m now sitting next to a woman whose husband wants to tell her where to sit, but who instead sits next to me. This seems like a good time to put on my headphones. 23 The Lone Steer Restaurant in Steele, North Dakota. This restaurant has a special back room for Greyhound passengers. They have arcade games, a pool table and a bar. I keep feeling like any moment now, they’re going to lock the door and do terrible things to us… but at least we can smoke in here. 24 “What would I have to pay you to switch seats with me?” the man whose wife chose to sit next to me now asks while I’m standing in line to pay for my food. “Seventy-five dollars!” I proclaim, beaming. (Now he keeps commenting to the other passengers about my rudeness. ) 25 In Bismark I am very excited to find a coffee machine at the terminal where we take a ten minute break. I get to choose the strength of my coffee and the amount of cream and sugar. And a large cup is only 45 cents! Smiling, I go through the complicated procedure of entering my preferences, then hit the start button. The coffee cup does not fall correctly. I get no coffee. “You know what tomorrow is?” I remark to another passenger, “You must be excited about this. ” “What’s that?” “Tomorrow’s Montana day!” It now seems that I’ll be taking this bus all the way to Seattle, then transferring to a Portland bus. Most likely there’ll be a long layover involved, not unlike my seven hour stay in Chicago. This might explain why the bus arrives in Seattle at 12:15 am on Friday, yet I was told that I wouldn’t get to Portland until 5:00 PM. I wonder what Seattle’s night life is like? 26 Hebron, North Dakota. The soil is red! Nobody ever told me that soil could be red! I want red soil. 27 Another little stop. It seems that they’re looking to have us buy a meal at every place we come across. This is a diner slash bowling alley. “We’re a drinking league with a bowling problem,” I overhear one man say. I’m growing fairly comfortable with this lifestyle. It’s been three days and two nights, with the final destination still not seeming particularly in sight. I’ve come to take this as a mindset. It’s difficult even to conceptualize, anymore, where I’m going or what I’m doing on this bus. Nod, be sociable, watch the land roll by, sleep. 28 Billings, Montana. My first action after stepping off the bus is to utilize the Galaga arcade unit. I achieve a new personal best of 247,000 points. Stepping outside, country music is playing through hazy reception out of a radio that I don’t bother to spot. Almost no one is out on the streets. This state is creepy… but I did buy a carton of cigarettes (and as a special bonus for doing so, received two free packs) at an obscenely low price. 29 An elderly man who sits next to me for a while tells stories about World War II. It takes me some time to notice that he’s missing a thumb. Talking to the guy who is going to British Columbia, he says that there has been drama happening towards the back of the bus because the old man who was playing country music through his radio outside of the Billings terminal apparently has some sort of nervous condition and people are afraid of him. I find clarification on my arrival time for Portland, which is 4:45 AM tomorrow rather than 5 PM. Once we get a significant enough break for me to make a phone call, I’ll have to get in touch with V. and Jack to let them know what’s up. Sixteen hours left—which, in the greater scheme of things, seems like absolutely nothing. 30 It’s all about saloons and slots and rodeo pubs and that feeling that you’re walking through somewhere humans weren’t meant to build. It was a shock to my system when I first saw different parts of the country and realized how much we really do differ from area to area. Since then, I’ve come to love the variety. People I’ve been watching for thousands of miles will move on to wherever they’re headed. They will start adventures and go back to their homes. I’m just growing older and taking it all in, getting bigger all the time. 31 Northern Idaho—the skinny part. The scenery is nice. We haven’t careened off any of the cliffs yet, so I’d say that things are going pretty well. Someone spilled a bit of pop (soda), so other passengers started standing up and freaking out. The driver pulled into the shoulder (breakdown lane), gave the people some paper towels and told them to sit down so as not to die while riding along the mountain curves. 32 Spokane, Washington. We have a half hour break as the bus is serviced. Concrete! Traffic! People! It feels like real life again. It’s been days since I had that. I walk, briefly, wanting to explore, but then remember that I need to call Portland. I talk to V. Because my bus is getting into town so early she gives me directions to The Roxy, an all-night diner, and says that I can kill some time there until she wakes up in the morning. Ten and a half hours remaining. 33 In Spokane a raspy-voiced and intoxicated man starts talking to me while we’re both using the restroom urinals. (The particular situation during which he decided to make introductions does not give me the best of first impressions. ) As it turns out, he’s also on my bus. At the first rest stop he tells me that he’s a broke alcoholic asthmatic with diabetes. “But don’t worry about me, Levi. A man’s gotta take care of himself, and I know how to take care of myself. ” I smoke my cigarette, watching the moving words on the gas station sign. “Okay. Good luck,” I say. Not long after this stop, the driver tells him, although not in so many words, to either stop bothering people or to expect to get kicked off the bus. 34 My first time seeing Seattle, I am happy to find it a substantial city. I would like to return here and explore someday, even if, while looking at the space needle, I think to myself, “Wait a minute. What the hell is the purpose of that thing?” One hour here, then onward to Portland. I sit outside, finding strange comfort in the litter on the ground, the city noises from all sides, the broken-up sidewalk. Even the cars, the stupid stupid inventions that they are. One might say that I wasn’t raised in the city, but I say that I wasn’t raised at all, except by my determination to learn the lessons of life firsthand. 35 I sit on the street with my guitar next to me just long enough to smoke a cigarette. Within that time I manage to swap email addresses with an aspiring DJ/producer. Following this another passerby stops in front of the terminal doors, looks at nothing in particular, stomps his feet rhythmically and recites a spoken word/rap for about thirty seconds before wandering off.

    "body": "36 I exit the terminal. “So this is Portland, Oregon!” I say aloud. One of the other travelers looks unenthralled; he responds, “Um, yup. ” I find my way to The Roxy, as directed. I sit outside. My first impression of this city is that of its population at 5 AM. None of them are in their right minds, of course. “Here, try some of this,” says a man to me, holding out a bottle of fragrance, “You know what this is?” “Abercrombie and Fitch, apparently,” I reply. “No thanks. ” “Just about the best you can get!” He then gets thrown out of The Roxy as quickly as he can enter it. 37 The Roxy, I’ve found, has an excellent jukebox. I munch on a Charles Bukowski Burger and look up at the giant crucified Jesus with a glowing halo. 38 Feeling like I’ve overstayed my first visit to The Roxy, I head outside and play guitar on the street for a while. V. and Jack eventually show up and say that coffee is needed. So, it’s back inside The Roxy with us! 39 My father emails and shatters my emotional peace. I’m sleepy, although I want to get to job hunting with Jack. I think I may lie down for a spell and see what happens. 40 My body, it turns out, is eager for rest after four days of nothing but sporadic naps. I sleep until V. returns from work, while Jack remains quietly wrapped up in the exciting world of digital typesetting. The apartment is in a building called The Civic, at W 19th and Burnside. It’s a one-bedroom with a pretty open space for the living room. The windows open directly to the sidewalk outside, so there are always passersby to watch. 41 The Renaissance, an Italian restaurant. Lighting cigarettes with the candle and playing card games. “I’ve never sat at the same table without moving for so long!” I say. “We don’t play games in Massachusetts!” V. somehow forgot that I’m out here with the intention to relocate, rather than just for a visit. “You’re going to stay in Portland?” she says, “Oh, wow! Yeah, you should!” Heath, the aspiring novelist from Montana, beats us all at a game of twenty-two. He talks about his intentions for being published: “Hardcover, softcover, whatever. Just pay me!” 42 We hang out at Heath’s place and watch The Green Mile. Heath eats a bowl of Corn Pops cereal—crunch, crunch. Meanwhile Jack is on the futon, I’m on the other futon, and V. is leaning on the futon where I’m sitting. I keep looking at everyone in the room, not interested in watching a movie at all. I feel bad because I said that I didn’t want to play a game of Illuminati. I know that I would just get frustrated: I don’t like games. I still need to explore the city. Maybe tomorrow. 43 Heath shows me a short story of his about a girl running naked through the forest. We’re drinking good beers and bad wine. I’m still impressed enough with this city to be happy about settling. I just have to push ahead with what I know that I need to do. 44 Jack and V. change their minds about going with us, so Heath and I hang out alone at The Roxy for awhile. At 5 AM the place is so packed that we wait fifteen minutes for a table. Strangers say hello passing in the night, not even giving the impression of mockery as they do so. “Yeah, Portland’s a friendly place,” I’m told. So it seems. 45 The Good Day Restaurant in Chinatown. I order a chrysanthemum drink and find that it’s quite yummy. The waitress questions my selection when I order it, saying, “To me it’s good, but to you, I don’t know. ” We just went to a big outside craft show. Portland’s in the midst of a two week long Rose Festival. The cutest moment ever was seeing a girl and her doggie each drinking from their own public water fountain at the same time. “Tapioca plus sweet and sour sauce tastes like peanut butter,” Jack informs us. 46 We walk across the bridges and talk a little bit about my plans for this city. It’s Jack and V. and myself and the tenth dirtiest river in America. Big naval vessels, both American and Canadian, are giving tours. It’s hard for me to relax and have fun, though, when I want to be piecing together a life for myself. Further pushing me towards getting things accomplished is the fact that… well, I’m just kind of here, staying with V. and Jack. It’s their life. I make a bad leech because that’s the last thing that I want to be. 47 Looking for insight on my life in this period of relocation, I did a tarot reading for myself. Using the 10-card Celtic Cross spread, 1 was the card drawn face-up, 2 was the card lain across the first. ____10____5__94__1+28____37______6 1: Eight of Swords (reversed)2: The Sun3: The World4: Prince of Cups5: The Devil6: Queen of Swords (reversed)7: The Chariot (reversed)8: Two of Wands (reversed)9: Temperance (reversed)10: “Guarantee: should a manufacturing defect be found in this deck before it has been extensively used, we will be glad to replace it. Return the Major Arcanas and the defective card to: (address)” (reversed) 48 I awaken to V. saying, “Get up! Get up! I’m taking you out for coffee!” We walk to Coffee Time, where we chat for a bit and play a good game of chess. (She wins. ) Then we go back to the apartment and kill time there for awhile. We try to locate the address of a particular venue that is holding an open mic show tonight, but it eludes us. So, I decide to wander the city on my own for a bit. The weather has been exquisite. Now I sit outside, and within the block and a half that I can see I spot five places to get espresso drinks. There are lots of fun-looking folks around, especially indie kids. There’s good public transportation, pigeons, public water fountains at seemingly every street corner, low rent, a decent cost of living… and most importantly, I feel small and insignificant. I talked to my mother today. She said that she was having a good feeling about my moving out here. She had talked to someone about the city and said she felt reassured about where I am. 49 sky overhead like in glimpses not now she jogs around the block wind shakes narrow tree chill but only slight subway now open car gray circled “p” headlight through twilight food between my teeth child exits restaurant car parking at angle “warning trains” (flashing) end cigarette. 50 Coffee Time, on my own. Just here to get some coffee. Rainy outside. Not uncomfortable, though. New England is just haunted, I think. Too much history, with misery, never quite sorted out. Something new that I see here in Portland: in public restrooms, rather than paper towels or hand dryers, a cloth towel that gets fed through a wheel, which apparently sanitizes it on the side not being used to dry your hands. But there aren’t enough mirrors in bathrooms! I faced this the last time I came west, too. It’s crazy! And now I’m off to look for employment. 51 I fill out an application for Starbucks on Northwest 21st. The woman with artificially blood-red hair and a neat silvery overshirt says that my coffee is on the house for my “so diligently spending time on the application. ” I knock on the window of V. and Jack’s place, knowing that V. should be back from work by now… but there’s no response, so I just keep on walking towards Pioneer Square, set on looking for work at all the coffee shops in that vicinity The rain has ceased, although the sky is still overcast. 52 I’m just odd enough to go into the dimly lit room of Coffee Time to write in my journal. Well… okay, it’s not that I felt immediately drawn here; it’s that when I came back in from having a cigarette, my previous seat had been taken. Also, I followed the sound of loud voices. I’m looking around, taking it all in, probably looking intimidated and lonely but hopeful. I’ve been feeling really nervous. I think of it as affection withdrawal. I need hugs! Wow, it really is a cultural thing for people to play games here. Folks are playing cards back here. I’ve spotted two chess boards in use elsewhere in the café. How boring, I say! These people need to learn about adventure! 53 Outside at Coffee Time for another of my cigarette breaks, I spot the opportunity that I’ve been waiting for—a stranger standing around on his own, looking anxious—and take full advantage by saying, “Hello, person standing by himself on the other side of the trash!” I ask him, and a woman who appears to be his s. o. when she comes out, about what there is to be found in this city. With enthusiasm they list off beautiful scenic sites and such. Then I ask, more specifically, where to meet people and hang out. They say Coffee Time and The Roxy, so I guess I’m off to an okay start. While I’m having this conversation, V. and Jack approach as scheduled. We sit in front of the restaurant next door for a bit, talking, then head over to Heath’s. He shows off the trailers for Fellowship of the Ring and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. V. ’s allergies bother her, though—he has two cats in the house—so we all head out, then. Predictably, we plan to go to The Roxy (predictably forgetting that The Roxy is closed on Mondays). Outside of V. and Jack’s, then, we run into Craig (V. ’s ex) who has been hanging around outside, waiting for us to come back, not knowing where we were. We go inside and play card games. V. decides that it’s time to go to sleep. I want to wander, so I accompany Heath on his journey home. We talk about humanity, him speaking of his disenchantment, me speaking of the mysterious chaotic clarity of true emotion. Then I go to Coffee Time again. Apparently they’re open until 3 AM. It’s packed right now, at 1:30 AM after a Monday night. I watch my cigarette burn. I’m sitting on the bench of a table out front. I strike up conversation with a guy who works here, named Damien. He says that on Tuesday nights they have Open Mic poetry readings. He also refers me to a place called Mojo’s for an Open Mic to play music. He says that I have the vibe of someone from the east coast. I sit down inside, embracing the opportunity to eavesdrop on a small group conversation. “I want to be a plasma donor!” exclaims one woman, hearing about this new idea for getting money, “Oh, wait, you have to be clean, though, huh?” Two people here say that they hated Rent. Ooo, a guy with a guitar! I watch him from behind, from the other room. 54 Night, going ‘round about 3 AM to Pioneer Square, guitar in hand, performing to the empty downtown, meeting Todd the friendly wanderer (who says that I sound like no other artist he’s ever heard, “And that’s a good thing”) and a homeless-for-the-night ex-juvenile delinquent white convert to Islam with a chosen name I don’t recall. Back at the apartment I’m sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag rather than on the couch, for no good reason other than the madness of nocturnal impulse. Waking alone, walking downtown to get/hand in more job applications, finding Craig just before getting back to Jack and V. ’s, him saying we’re all to meet at Coffee Time before going to dinner, walking to Coffee Time where Heath is sitting outside, all of us going to The Renaissance before splitting up, my going to Coffee Time in anticipation of the Open Mic poetry reading. Now I sit outside, occasionally butting in on conversations. 55 A poetry reading. 15 people in a little room. “I wasn’t writing much for a while,” says one girl. “Get LiveJournal,” I say, “You’ll find that you never stop. ” “I have LiveJournal!” she says. We swap usernames. Her name is Kat. Someone has been locked in the bathroom here for the past twenty minutes. The fire department has come. Hm. That stinks. I have to pee. They carry out the person. He overdosed. I’m going to Heath’s to pee. 56 I finally have the somewhat open discussion with V. that we hadn’t gotten around to since my arrival. It’s not that there’s much to be said, really, but it’s an assertion that we’re both comfortable with the idea of being in each other’s life, knowing we’ve affected each other’s life, knowing we’ve moved onto our own individual paths, respecting each other’s choices. “Wow, you’re in my living room,” she says.  “Wow, I’m in your living room,” I say. She, Jack and I adventure to buy cigarettes, go to an ATM and then to hit The Roxy in the middle of the night. Morning comes, sun through the window, people passing by. It’s time for me to sleep. 57 I ask Jack to suggest somewhere for me to go, looking for work, looking for something. He suggests that I see the east side, there’s a big mall over there. He assumes that I’ll take the MAX, but when time isn’t an issue I’ll always default to walking. I navigate myself over the river and to the mall on foot. I’m incredibly frightened by the fact that it reminds me of every other mall in America, and that it reminds me of the existence of teenagers. I hurry away, back to V. and Jack’s, finding that they’ve gone. They’ve left directions in case I want to join them, but I’m a little worn out and decide to stick to this general area for awhile. (On my way back, sitting down with a cigarette and beverage for a break in my walk, a woman comes by asking if I need anything, from a program helping street kids with needle exchanges. She tells me to hold onto the card she gives me, of course, regardless of my assurances to her that I am not, in fact, a heroin user. “The friends you’re staying with are from Portland?” she asks. I say yes, not bothering to think that they’re not originally from here. “Give the card to them, then. ” She smiles. ) 58 I’ve only been here for four days. 59 I see someone skip! Yay! She skips into the embrace of a guy with a mohawk. I’m getting used to this city, bit by bit. 60 I like to sit in public rather than in private. So, I take my guitar with me to Coffee Time. I sit and play to myself. A man comes by, tells me that I’m really good, then falls asleep on the sidewalk. Heath comes by, says that he’s definitely not going to find a job in time to pay the next month’s rent. I talk about how uncertain I am of exactly what I’m doing here in Portland. He suggests that he might want to go to Massachusetts, if I rethink the idea of staying here. Feeling sleepy, I decide to head back in the direction of V. and Jack’s, planning to retire early (about 11 PM). As I’m walking, I think to myself about how much I’d like to take my music to the next level, but how I haven’t been able to find any leads in terms of getting into a local music scene. I’m so busy thinking that I don’t hear the guy who’s yelling, “Hey, you have a guitar!” from across the street. He runs over to me, though, carrying a mini guitar of his own. He tells me to play him something. I perform a song. He throws in his own backup vocals until we’re interrupted by a couple that stops to offer us potato chips before walking on. He has me play randomly while he sings his lyrics. A woman tells us that we rock. The guy tells me about open mics in the area. We talk about Radiohead and Jeff Buckley a bit before parting ways. When I get back to the apartment complex I’m stopped yet again by a couple of drunk guys who say they want to jam, and for me to meet them back in the lobby in five minutes. I figure, what the heck, but after a little bit of waiting I’m getting sleepy. They knock on the door looking for me. I tell them I’m going to sleep. I can’t sleep, though. Instead, I cook ramen and think. 61 What do people do, rather than write? The bus thinks I want a ride. I wave it on. 62 Walking over the Burnside Bridge, out of the corner of my eye it looks like a car flashes its lights at me. “Maybe my headlights aren’t on,” I think to myself, “Wait a minute. What?!” 63 On the MAX, to the cinemas to see Atlantis, which is apparently Disney’s latest animated offering. V. is in a down mood. Cheer up, V. , cheer up! I draw a flower for her as a gesture of happiness, but she draws a sad face on it. So I draw Satan for her instead. She prefers this. Portland, Oregon. I’ve been here for one week. 64 Sitting outside of the arcade at the big scary mall. A little boy runs up and asks, “Are you a boy?” I reply that yes, I am. “Why’ve you got your nails painted, then?” Sometimes I forget that things like this are still considered uncommon by some. Atlantis was better than I had feared. Now, to counteract the experience of having watched a Disney movie, V. and Jack are playing Carnevil in the arcade. Most of the mall is closed at this point. 65 Coffee Time, messy after a Friday night’s business. The guy on the couch opposite me comments on the very silly conversation another guy is having with an unseen woman who’s in the middle of a chess game. Besides his ridiculous comments about not knowing many female chess players, he says, “If any of your girlfriends play chess, send them to where I work”—which, of course, brings to my mind a vision of this woman’s multiple lesbian lovers going there to break his kneecaps. I guess I just have a fanciful imagination. The word “girlfriends” to reference a woman’s female friends? Wow. How very old-timey. 66 “I want to take the sterilized needle of truth and pierce the cosmic callous!” A walk and a visit to The Roxy with V. , comfortable and right-feeling. “Once upon a time, in 1996, in an AOL chat room… has come to this. ” For a while now, my life has been one gasp of amazement after another at just where things can go, how epic it all seems. When I was a child, the idea of growing into an adult seemed to me fairly simple. I was told that people went to school, graduated, got a job, dated until they fell in love, married, and had children. But so far, I’m not even sure I’ve ever met anyone on that path. 67 Wandering about with V. , Jack, and their friend Paul. Paul keeps me entertained by attacking the things that I say and making me justify myself, yay! We stopped at a diner. There was a quote from “Bill the Proprietor” on the menu: “If it’s not deep fried or smothered with cheese, it’s probably a salad!” 68 Sweat on my brow, boogies in my nose. A warm day out, close to uncomfortably so because I’m just walking, wandering, looking for a job. (Sitting outside of Music Millennium. People-watching. ) I have the theme to Small Wonder stuck in my head. There was something so cheesily beautiful about random 80’s shows like that. I remember when I was about 16, when I discovered that reruns of Out of this World were being played every morning at something like 2 AM. I watched it like every night. (But I haven’t watched television for over a year now. ) A woman takes cardboard out of the funky gift shop. I think about what I might look like aged a couple decades. The woman takes out recyclables now. A carful of guys is parking. An old man with red suspenders asks me whether I’m drawing. I say that I’m writing. He nods and walks inside. 69 The longest game of Uno ever, with V. , Jack, and Heath. (I win. ) V. wanting to stay up playing Diablo 2, Jack not wanting to leave, my going with Heath to Coffee Time. Meeting Lauren, whom Heath knows. She gives us both tarot readings. "

    "body": "70 In front of Coffee Time, I turn to the woman sitting to my left and say, “Hey, are you busy?” She looks up from something she’s reading and answers, “No, why?” “Do you want to be my friend?” I ask. “Um, sure, I guess. ” “Great! I have a 57-question application here. For my friendship. ” I hand it to her. She laughs and starts to look it over. I walk to the group of people to my right, and say, “Hey, do any of you want to fill out an application to be my friend?” Being a small group of friends, they look at each other, and for several moments there’s silence. A woman says that she’s leaving town soon, so she can’t really befriend me, but she would like to see the application. When she reads it, she asks whether she can fill it out just for fun. I tell her that she may. She says that her friend is likely to want to fill one out as well, once he comes by. He comes by and asks if he can fill out his in Mandarin. I politely ask that he not do so. He suggests doing it in French, his native language. I tell him that I can in fact read French and that he should fill out his application in French. He does. No one actually talks to me while they fill out their applications, nor do they talk to me afterwards. The people in the small group continue to talk amongst themselves; the solitary woman wanders off. But I do get a glimpse into the minds of a few strangers—Katy, Isabelle, and Jean-luc. 71 Awkward and without caffeine, I walk about in search of Café Lena and fail to notice it. Hungry, I dine at the Plaid Pantry convenience store on an assortment of junk food. Eventually I notice the café, which was in plain sight all along. Coffee with espresso, mmm. It’s good. This is a small place. I see the sign-up sheet for the poetry reading. At times I get like this: I turn to the blank page for someone I can speak to without fear. 72 As soon as you’re born, the begging begins. You need to find the things you have to offer, or which you can convince other people that you have to offer, so that you can survive. Someone else always owns what you need to survive. 73 Coffee Time once more. I bought a bear claw at the convenience store to curb my increasing hunger. Kat is here. 74 Kat was very nice to me. I spent some time chatting and being silly with her and her friends Dalileh and Long-haired John. It was a great relief to meet people while not feeling like I should be wearing a guise in front of them. 75 I walk to the all-night convenience store to buy soda. As I walk home, a plain-looking man in a baseball cap asks me for a cigarette. I give him one. “You have a nice body,” he says. “Oh. Thanks,” I reply, taking my lighter back and walking away. 76 “How else could two months’ salary last forever?” ask the diamond commercials. A THOUSAND POUNDS OF SPAGHETTI-O’S! 77 I call up a temp agency. The woman on the other end says, as though telling a child that Santa Claus doesn’t exist, “With the market as it is, I wouldn’t want to waste your time by having you come in to apply. ” At least I didn’t follow everyone’s advice to work toward a career in technology. Are there any employed techies left? 78 I exit McDonald’s with a coffee. At the top of the stairs is a pile of bags, blankets, etc. and a happy-looking black dog. I kneel down to say hello, rubbing the dog’s head. Quickly, a hippie girl with dreadlocks exits the doors, and says, in a hurt, pleading, and somewhat menacing voice, “Please don’t pet my dog!” I apologize and walk away. 79 The bus comes by. I board it. Crazy red light, voices nonchalant and difficult to interpret, lost in the noise of public transportation, the noise of the city. The driver is saying to someone, “I’m sorry, sir, but you’re too drunk to get on the bus. That’s it, get out. Sit back down. ” 80 I get to Mojo’s because I know that Wednesday nights feature the musical open mic. Little do I know, however, that this started at 7 PM. By the time I arrive, they’re already starting to close down. My little excursion to the southeast ends up being solely for the purpose of getting a cappuccino. Eek! I realize that my mom’s birthday was a few days ago. I need to give her a call. 81 I walk to Coffee Time. I stand around in line to get myself a beverage. “Levi!” I hear called out from my left. It’s Dalileh and Long-haired John. I sit down and chat for awhile. I read a fun observational piece of writing that Dalileh has done. John and another guy whose name I never catch decide that they’re going to be strippers for an amateur night. A lengthy and amusing conversation about how best to be a male stripper ensues. I step outside for a cigarette. Lauren comes by; I notice her coat before I notice who she is and, just as I did the first time I met her, I ask if I can have it. Only then do I recognize her. She says that she has time to kill in order to give her roommate time alone with her boyfriend. We chat, observing and interacting with the other random folks who are hanging around. Dalileh comes out to look for me. I introduce her to Lauren, then she goes back inside for a bit longer before coming out to say goodbye. She gives the best hug that I’ve received from a Portlander thus far, even though by way of this hug I injure her and she takes time to recover. I walk to buy cigarettes with Lauren. She asks whether I’ve been to Forest Park yet. I say that I haven’t, so we walk there. It’s very dark. More often than not, I can’t see what I’m walking on and need to trust her dim silhouette to lead the way. I stop her midway along the journey. We sit for a bit while I alternate between silently taking in the sensations of nature, draining the frustrations that have been haunting with, and talking about video games from the ’80s. We finally reach our destination. Led by the flame of my lighter, we walk up moss-covered steps to where a fire has been left. She tells me that this place was a bathroom in the 1920’s, and is now sometimes referred to as The Witches’ Castle, home to rituals and keggers alike. She says that she can see an initiation was just held here tonight, that she had initiated herself on the last year’s summer solstice. She explains that the fates want her to pursue her spirituality more. We talk about things like the presentation of oneself to the outside world and the stifling games of society. By the time the sun has begun to rise and the fire has almost burnt out, she’s remembered that she needs to go to an interview at noon. She goes home to sleep. I walk back to Jack and V. ’s. 82 I carry the application that I’ve filled out for the Fred Meyer Supermarket. Suddenly, I lose my grip on it and it flies into the middle of Burnside. I try to follow it across the street, but once I reach the other side it blows to the sidewalk from which I came. I cross again; it blows away yet again. I give up, deciding to fill out a new application when I arrive at the store. The informational application session begins with the guy who’s in charge of hiring talking about store policy. Noting that both I and the other male who is applying have long hair, he explains that according to store policy, hair length must be above the collar for males, and that tying it back is not an option. “What’s the dress code for females?” asks the girl with red and black dyed hair and a nose piercing. “Uh… nothing!” he laughs. When he leaves the room to do something, I take it as an opportunity to sneak out. “Tell him I said bye-bye,” I say to the other applicants. I go back to the apartment to work on an application for the Plaid Pantry. 83 Mojo’s, late afternoon on Thursday. I’ve taken a bus out to this destination for the open mic poetry reading. I waste time by reading a book. A comfortable breeze blows over me. Shortly before the start of the reading, Kat, Long-haired John, and Dalileh show up. I wander through the evening—taking in a couple of poets, then stepping outside, walking for a few blocks before returning, looking to the sky for stars I can’t see through the blanketing clouds. Most of the readings are amusing, often hostile, targeted attacks against whomever. John reads, alternating between enunciation away from the microphone through his waves of infinite dark hair and accented moments voicing into the microphone. I read, sitting on the floor hunching over my binder of collected works from 1999. At the end of the night Kat steps up to the mic, reading one poem of Dalileh’s and one of her own in her clear, Shakespearean reading voice. Somehow, speaking with Kat, we get on the subject of wishes. I say that I have a difficult time coming up with single wishes when given the opportunity, because I’m not one who wants a lot of specific things. She grabs my hand and runs with me outside, telling me to wish on a star. I manage to come up with a vague something. Most of the 24 hours that follow are a manifestation of this wish. 84 Riding in a car for the first time since my arrival on the west coast, I smile and poke fun at Kat’s awkward and sometimes frightening driving maneuvers, while Long-haired John and Dalileh sit in the backseat. We’re going from the open mic to Coffee Time. The feel of a fun, youthful carpool apparently overflows when, at a stoplight, Kat eyes the truck with a couple of young guys in the next lane over and says, “I’ll bet they want to race us!” knowing fully well that this is not the case and that her car is not a racing vehicle. She rolls down the window and says, “Hey, wanna race?” The guy in the passenger’s seat just laughs. The truck accelerates quickly as soon as the light turns green, presumably as a playful joke. Unfortunately, though, a nearby police cruiser is not as amused, and they’re pulled over as we pass. 85 In the post-midnight, early morning hours of Friday, after hanging around at Coffee Time pondering whether or not a person may give as sexy a look while biting their upper lip as while biting their lower lip, Kat, Dalileh, Long-haired John and I ride in one vehicle, followed by David and Caleb in another. A stop is made at John’s. While he runs inside I talk with Dalileh and Kat about religions. After David and Caleb show up, driving arrangements are altered: Kat and I are left alone in her car to sing duets of Tori Amos songs. Dalileh’s apartment in the suburbs is pretty and spacious. It’s in an area that, as I describe it, “is so safe that I would feel all right about falling asleep in the middle of the road with a sign that says, ‘Please do bad things to me. ’” Somehow I end up being the one holding onto the microwaved popcorn and Hot Tamales while we begin to watch the DVD of Traffic. Considering that these snacks are under my care, I take it as my responsibility to eat most of them. Not even halfway through the film I crawl over to the window and stare out into the sky, which is just beginning to show the faintest hints of an impending summer sunrise. I ask if it would be rude for me to step out for a walk. I am told to feel free. I do. Once I’m outside, Kat joins me. We walk directionlessly, eventually stopping on a curb that I’m particularly drawn to. I note that environments like this feel as though they’re abandoned film sets. We discuss where we’ve been and where we’re going. As I often do when silence comes to the conversation, I interject with difficult and personal questions, but for the most part that isn’t necessary. Walking by the hot tub, Kat suggests that we can dip our feet in it. After deliberation over how exactly we might get into and out of the locked pool area, we finally realize that we can just get the key from Dalileh. We go back to the apartment. The movie’s just ending. Dalileh and John are sleepy, but Caleb wants to join us. The three of us talk about music and theater. Back to Dalileh’s apartment once more, she and John are half-asleep in bed, but the rest of have decided that we’re on a quest to find a swing set. We leave them to their slumber, with thanks to Dalileh for her hospitality. We step forth into the morning. 86 We end up at Forest Park. Caleb claims to have a vague understanding of whereabouts a swing set can be found, but we don’t focus much on finding this. We walk on a trail through the woods. Kat keeps trying to explore the less-traveled pathways, but they never seem to lead anywhere. We decide to look for the rose garden. We come to a walkway that’s closed apparently for no reason at all. We sit near it, on benches. People working for the park keep asking us if we work there. We decide that we should go somewhere to find food… if we can find our way back to the car. We get directions from one park employee. When he comes by with a small vehicle that has an empty flatbed back, we ask if we can sit on it and get a ride. “Sure, why not,” he says. We hang on and are taken part of the way there. Coincidentally, though, we stumble across a playground with a swing set. We swing and laugh. After this, we also coincidentally find the rose garden. We walk through it. It’s beautiful. We lose track of where we are again. We keep asking different people for directions. We walk a long way uphill, then ask a passing bicyclist whether this is the way towards the archery area. “No,” she replies, “It’s back that way,” pointing back in the direction from which we came. But then she realizes: “No, wait. There’s the archery area right up ahead. ” Finally—we are no longer lost in the park! We eat at a nice place on Hawthorne. I verbally go through my friendship application with the two of them. Kat says that she wants to think more about many of the questions, that she’ll answer them more thoroughly on paper when she gets the chance. Caleb seems shocked and confused by the questions. Driving back into the west side, in traffic, Kat wants to stop at Powell’s Books to use the restroom. I say that I haven’t yet been to Powell’s, that we should explore it. I look to the back seat at the sleeping Caleb. We ask him if he’s okay with hanging out inside for awhile. “Okay,” he replies groggily. We each wander independently through Powell’s, agreeing to meet in the café area. Once reunited, Kat and I we play games of questions with each other and observe the other customers. She sees someone she knows from an improv group, whose performance she has already invited me to. Then we realize that about an hour has passed and Caleb still hasn’t come to find us. We try paging him and search every area of the giant store, but he’s nowhere to be found. We decide that he must have left for some reason. As we get back in the car, I say to Kat, as I am saying every time another phase of our wandering ends, “Well! I’m ready to start my day now. How about you?” "

    "body": "87 By the middle of Friday I have been adventuring for fifteen hours straight. I’m starting to view it almost as a competition, a game from which John, Dalileh, David and Caleb have all been eliminated at different stages, in which Kat and I are the only competitors left. She seems remarkably unaffected. We randomly choose Anna Bannanas, a coffee house on NW 21st, as a place to visit. I show her the downstairs area, which looks and feels like someone’s basement from the early ’80s. I drink a root beer. We talk about how far back in time everything that’s happened over the course of the past night and day seems now. On the couch, I lie on her for a bit. She explains her ability to feel people’s heartbeat/pulse from just about any part of the body. We speak with someone who comes down alone and is reading. He is friendly, responding well to my prodding questions. We leave after an employee comes down, sees us being cuddly, and says, “All right, guys. This is a coffee shop, not a flop house. ” We get drinks from Coffee Time and walk to a nearby park. We continue to ask each other odd personal questions. We watch the frolicking children. “I want children,” I say. “Now?” she asks. “Aw. Well, okay. I suppose that I should probably wait a little while, huh?” We wander a bit. Outside of the Plaid Pantry, I give Kat a “letter to someone I’ve yet to meet”, which I wrote when I was lonely two years ago, which I’ve never before thought to give to anyone. I wrote it after returning to Massachusetts, where I no longer knew anyone, in 1999, after spending time in California. Next we go to V. and Jack’s, because I figure that by now they’re probably concerned about my whereabouts. V. is at the computer playing Diablo 2. Without looking away from the screen, she says, “We were going to call the police if you weren’t back in another hour. ” Jack comes home. The connection is made that V. and Jack have met Kat before—that they had considered buying a kitten from her. Kat and I head towards the place where the improv show is going to be held. I buy a small paper cup of coffee for a dollar before it’s announced that because only four members of the troupe are there and not much of anyone is there as an audience, the show is canceled. At this point, the things that we’re doing are less based on what we want to do and more based on the odd desire to simply do anything other than sleep. 88 Hazily approaching the point of having hung out for 24 hours straight without sleep, it’s about sunset on Friday when we get pizza at Rocco’s. The sleep deprivation is beginning to affect me. I’m finding myself growing quieter. Kat hints that she suspects I should want to go to sleep soon, but I tell her that I don’t want to be outdone. After pizza we go to Coffee Time and somehow see no problem with believing that our state of mind would allow for a game of chess. I give up after making a variety of ridiculous moves. We try going back and forth with asking each other questions about ourselves, but it’s getting tough. We head outside. V. , Jack, Heath and Mal are sitting out front. I say hello and stand around a bit, talking a little. I realize how completely unable to function I am around people who have slept the night before. I take Kat for a walk to break away from the influence of people in functional mindsets. We sit on the sidewalk. As she did the night before, she points out the first star seen of the evening through the clouds. “Make a wish,” she says. “I’m afraid to,” I say. Unable to think of an appropriate wish, I say that I think I should get to sleep. She agrees. She drops me off at Jack and V. ’s. I sleep, but not for long. 89 My Saturday awakening is not what I would have hoped: I find myself irreversibly roused by the movements, sounds, and heavy breathing of Mal, V. ’s friend from Bakersfield, who wasn’t able to get to his usual place of shelter on this night, who is sleeping on the floor. Having just earlier in the day spent the last of my money, I search through the darkness to find change on the floor that could get me coffee at The Roxy. Mal awakens, partially; I ask him for a contribution. He helps out with about three dollars in change. Walk, walk, walk. “Can you spare some change?” someone asks me. Walk, walk, walk. Past the neon sign flashing, “Buy… art! Buy… art!” under which, as usual, someone is sleeping, wrapped in blankets. Walk, walk, walk. “Spare some change for hash browns?” someone else asks me. I sit down to finish a cigarette in front of The Roxy. “Anastasia,” is the single word that I overhear before a group of people enter the diner. I get a quick coffee, plus french fries, then walk to Pioneer Square to sit for a bit. A large insect with wings attaches itself to my pant leg. It’s beelike, but looking at it I find it to be rather distinct and unlike any bee that I’ve ever seen. I try to shake it/scrape it from my leg to a discarded paper cup on the ground. the insect falls and rolls into a seemingly defenseless ball. An old man with a lunatic’s laugh distracts me from writing. I don’t find this as entertaining as I usually would. I excuse myself and walk away. 90 Disappointed in myself, Saturday afternoon, I call my mother and say that I’m out of money. Pleasantly, she says that she wanted to talk to me because she was going to send me some money anyway, plus she’s going to get the cash from selling the guitar amplifier that I told her to do with as she pleased. I go to Kinko’s and drop off my application. I’m very tired, having only slept for about four hours, but in the morning, with everyone awake, Jack said, “Get a job, you lazy bum!” I had wanted to go out and accomplish a lot with this day, to take advantage of the new parts of the city that I had seen in my journeying. Plus, with V. being home, I wanted to bring her along on the job hunt, because she has been pushing me to spend more time with her. V. wanted to sleep some more first, though, and she suggested that I drop off the Kinko’s application, that later she would join me in searching for employment. I get the money I’ve been wired and hand the Kinko’s application to a woman whose look upon receiving it said, “Oh, you poor soul, you have no idea how non-existent your chances of getting this job are, do you?” I sit down at the computer and chat with people for a bit. Tina talks to me about Mick, her “date” with him and such. Eventually, V. opens the door. “You were supposed to wake me up when you got back from Kinko’s!” she scolds. I had forgotten this and was waiting for her to awaken. “Are you online?!” I disconnect. I tell her that I had forgotten to try and wake her up. “Do you really expect that I’m going to believe that you completely forgot, you didn’t think about it at all?!” She’s yelling at me now. I try to sate her because I don’t want to yell, don’t want to yell. She won’t calm down. She says that she can’t come with me now, that she has to let Jack into the apartment when he gets home. She goes in the shower. I lie down on the couch. I’ve taken in too much. The drive to fight my overtiredness has been more than crushed by this. What I hate the most is directionless fighting. She comes out. She asks if I’m going to sleep. I tell her that I am. She tells me that I’m not. She then proceeds to yell at me more, making sleep seem to me more and more like the only thing that I could possibly do to feel better. I know that the wrong tone in my voice will make her argue more, push me more. I need to figure out when I should come back, so that I can get inside and not distract any other plans that she and Jack might have. She pulls me into trying to justify myself, explain myself. Once I reach a pathetic state of parades of sentence fragments and a whining tone of voice, as though ready to bawl like a small child, she changes her tone of voice to that of “it’s for your own good” mode. She plays with my hair slightly. I lie on the floor to collect myself. She interrupts me to ask why I’m just lying on the floor instead of moving. I say that I need to organize the pieces of myself. Laughing a soft, sad laugh, I say that I never defend myself, I just have to keep gluing the pieces of me back together after I’m attacked and shattered. She says that when she feels upset, she takes some time out and makes herself be able to function again. I tell her that’s exactly what I mean, that’s what I was trying to do. She says that since after lying on the floor I don’t feel better, I’m obviously not doing it right. At that point, I just leave. I collect myself by writing at the bus stop. Then I realize that I don’t know how to get to where I want to go. 91 I walk to Pioneer Square, where V. was supposed to have met up with Mal for some coffee. I hope to ask them for directions. I don’t see them, so I just walk, hoping to find somewhere, anywhere to apply to. I just end up by the river. I fall asleep in the grass, across from a couple making out. I wake up after a bit and walk back to the apartment. I fall asleep. I wake up in the evening to a game of Illuminati between V. , Jack, Craig and Heath. I decide to go out to find something to eat or drink. Since Heath lives near Coffee Time and the group is disbanding for the evening, I walk with him in that direction. Heath doesn’t stay at Coffee Time for very long. I sit and drink some cherry cola. Just as I’m ready to leave, a guy with multiple facial piercings starts talking to me. I sit for a while to chat with him and a girl who refuses to tell me her name. We talk about friendship, Skinny Puppy, and noise. He suggests that we go to see something or other at Waterfront Park. I agree. We walk over a bridge. It connects to a walkway, but a gate has been set up in front of it to stop passengers. He pulls out wire cutters from his pocket and we enter. We wander for a bit. He’s very anti-establishment and expresses interest in learning just about everything. I ask what he wants to do with himself in the future. He says that he wants to sustain himself in a shack and become an eco-terrorist. He pokes around at every man-made piece of architecture, interested in hidden storage areas and forbidden spaces. He wanders down to the water’s edge, climbing on rocks. I remain on the walkway and watch the river. I say that I want to go back west so as to get some time to myself for writing. He keeps me company up until The Roxy, where he considers going in but realizes that he doesn’t have enough money for coffee. He instead leaves to embark on his long walk home. I return to V. and Jack’s. 92 During my final days of life in Massachusetts, Jonny had a running joke that I should sell off aspects of my personality: “Everything about him must go!” he would exclaim in the style of a used car salesman. 93 I get to the Plaid Pantry for my second interview only to discover that it’s been postponed. I’m told to expect a call within the next couple of days. I walk to Powell’s, where I’ve arranged to meet up with Amber (someone I’ve been talking to on the Internet) at 1:00. I sit, reading a McSweeney’s book sampler. An hour later, having finished all of the slim volume, no one has approached me. Knowing that I won’t be able to get back inside the apartment until V. gets home, I walk to Coffee Time. (I later learn that Amber was there all along, sitting, nervous about approaching me. ) 94 I could eat the chocolate bar that I bought to give to Amber, but I don’t really like chocolate bars very much. I could smoke another of my clove cigarettes… yes! That’s what I’ll do. Hm. Only one remaining in the pack, and it’s broken. Well, I’ll smoke it while covering the broken part with my fingers! Yes! That’s what I’ll do. Hm. That’s not working very well. I’ll repair it by tearing the paper from the filter and placing it inside! Okay, that’s satisfactory. I recognize the guy a couple of tables down as the guy Kat and I forced to talk to us downstairs at Anna Bannanas during our adventures in sleep deprivation. My clove is dead now. 95 I talk to Lauren. I push her to tell me about what’s been going on in her life. She explains some things to me. (“And eventually it’s like we’re just standing alone in a tiny little space, completely isolated by this maze of unbreakable walls, and we know that everyone else is in the maze somewhere, but we can’t get to them. ”) After some thinking aloud, she says, “I have to go for a walk. I’ll be right back,” and she gives herself a tarot reading. She says that it tells her everything she already knows. 96 I hang out for awhile with Lauren and her friends. I think to myself that it would be nice to be able to open up to people more. 97 Jack and V. still are not home. Here I am at Coffee Time. What a long day. 98 By the time I call the apartment to find someone on the other end of the line, it’s about midnight. Long-haired John and Dalileh are at Coffee Time, but I’m really tired and head back to fall asleep on the couch. As soon as I’ve drifted off into sleep back at the apartment, the fire alarm goes off. “Eh, don’t worry about it. It’s probably just some freaks playing a prank. As always,” says Jack. I sit awake staring into space until the fire department comes and turns the alarm off. 99 At the Market Decisions Corporation, I take a typing test and find that I type 90 words per minute. Then It’s time for the sample call survey, but since they’re understaffed I’m told that no one in the office has time to do it with me. I’m handed a page out of the phone book and am told to call people until somebody will fill out my sample survey. Thirty minutes of hang-ups, answering machines and refusals later, I’m told to dial an extension number so that a secretary can take the survey from me. I’m interviewed for a couple of moments afterward, then I’m told that I’ll be contacted after my references have been called. I mention that since I didn’t have the numbers on hand, they weren’t in the application. “Oh, we’ll just look them up on the Internet,” I’m told. I sit at the bus stop. The bus comes, but passes me by. 100 Long-haired John’s party. I stay outside for the sake of the moonlight. I don’t mean to be antisocial. (Kat had never heard of Jeff Buckley. ) When I left the apartment earlier tonight, V. told me, “I don’t know when you’ll be able to expect us back. ” I feel like I can rely less and less on that living space.

    "body": "101 I’ve been awkwardly playing songs to myself, on my own, on the steps outside of where the party’s going on. Dalileh and Kat come out to see me. I appreciate the gesture. The two ask me how I’m doing. I reply that I’m okay, pretty much. I point out the moon. “I want to dance in the moonlight,” I say, and with that, we’ve made plans. First, though, Dalileh wants to change into something warmer and more comfortable, since she’s in a mini-skirt and tank top at this point. Kat stays behind while I come along for the ride to Dalileh’s apartment. Along the way I talk to her about my feelings on relocation, my stresses and so on. She suggests that if I end up needing to I can stay with her for awhile. Her friend Ruby calls and is invited to come join us in our adventures. To Dalileh’s. She changes. We get food at Jack in the Box. To Ruby’s; we pick her up. Then back to John’s. John lets us all pick out coats of his to take. The one that I end up with is long, thin, and beige. We go to Coffee Time for a fill of caffeine. When the others complain of a lack of energy, I say, “Okay, I’ll be back in just a second,” run to the end of the block and back, then make throwing motions towards them, exclaiming, “Energy! energy!” A random guy whose name I never catch, along with his dog, comes with us to the park. All of us split up and wander about in our own frolics. From across the grass I hear Kat yell to the sky, “Moonlight! Where are you!” because a cloud covering has obscured it. I run over and introduce myself as moonlight. She’s skeptical, but I argue intensely that I am, in fact, moonlight. We spin about and twirl each other. She falls over from dizziness, but I don’t—I learned my lesson when I fell and bloodied up my nose doing that a couple years back. I sit and talk with Kat, the two of us having a question and answer session. Then, all of us except for the stranger and his dog take off for Dalileh’s. We’re taking two cars. I keep Kat company on the ride. As we exit the car, she follows our tradition of impulsively asking each other personal questions by saying, “Do you ever avoid doing things simply because doing them would be too hard?” I say that I don’t, that in fact I usually take the path of most resistance. “I’m just the opposite,” she says, “Things don’t end up being negative, really, but they don’t end up being really positive either. ” Inside, everyone lounges about in the living room. Dalileh takes pictures of us. The overtired John pretends to fall asleep leaning against the wall. “Does that loveseat feel more comfortable than the one you’re used to?” Kat asks. “Very much so,” I reply cozily. “I’ll bet the bed’s even more comfortable!” John suggests, and with that everyone races to the bedroom and jumps on the bed. The twenty minutes that follow consist mostly of people poking each other and asking, “Whose leg is that?” while Dalileh and Ruby talk to each other in Farsi. Kat says she’s not going to be able to fall asleep like this anytime soon. From opposite ends of the bed we play with each other’s hands. Since neither of us are falling asleep, I ask if she wants to move to the living room and chat. I lose my ability to initiate conversation, however, when she begins to use the one action which will bring me completely at the mercy of another—playing with my hair. We end up in a relaxing cuddle and fall asleep that way on the loveseat. After some sleep, we go outside on the porch for some fresh air. Through the morning, I watch the suburban residents ride bicycles and take off for work. She lies in my lap and I play with her hair. She says that she is going to take off. She asks if I want a ride back to downtown. Not wanting to find myself locked out of Jack and V. ’s—since I don’t realize that it’s the weekend and that therefore V. will be home—I decline the offer. She accepts a quick hug and departs. I drift in and out of sleep for most of the morning until the others awaken. 102 After a trip to an unfamiliar coffee shop on NW 23rd, after Dalileh and Ruby take off because Dalileh has to work, John and I go to a house sale and then to Coffee Time. I hand friendship applications to some people John has started up a conversation with, Jodi and Becca. They seem enthusiastic about my application and write nice things about me on them. Then, after John has left to catch his bus, I fill out one of my own applications for them. Upon reading my responses, Jodi asks, “Where in Massachusetts are you from?” I tell her. She enthuses that she’s originally from Amherst, that the two of them go to college in Boston and are in Portland for the Summer. I walk back towards the apartment until I’m stopped by the sound of V. yelling to me from across the street. She’s at The Renaissance with Heath. We sit there for a while, then go to Heath’s and watch the first few episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. 103 Overheard: “It’s weird that people buy their apartments online. ” “They’re probably called ‘e-condos’ or something. ” I order a coffee. Fishing through my pocket for change, overhearing only shards of the words spoken by the employees. “His wiring is going to short circuit. ” “Robot?” “I think he’s a robot. ” And I’m asked if I’m a robot and I say yes and I think they say something about my possibly being an alien as well, but it’s too early for me to comprehend. I went to a party in Vancouver, Washington last night. And it’s July now. I forget why I left the apartment. Oh, yeah—I wanted to buy cigarettes, but without having keys, I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to get back inside until V. and Jack woke up. A guys sits down and says, “I’m not drinking ever again. No more. ” The conversation around me is about heartache, Percoset, video games. 104 One night, Kat drove Dalileh, John, and I out of the city, out into nature somewhere, so that we could all go on a camping trip. Getting her car to a good location for parking turned into a minor adventure in its own right, as it almost got stuck in mud. This plus other delays led to us having less hiking time than expected, so instead of going to our planned camp site we pitched our tent by a small lake we passed. John took off his clothes and went into the lake naked while the rest of us smiled and stayed modest and Kat took pictures. 105 On Broadway, Long-haired John is playing the saxophone as I kneel nearby, smoking, filling time before we go to the movies to see A. I. 106 A man stops as he walks by. He says, “Hey, man, do me a favor?” I look him in the eye and say nothing. He just looks at me for a number of seconds and then says, “Spare me a dollar? If I don’t get a dollar, I’m gonna lose my pants. ” He doesn’t elaborate. “I’m sorry, I can’t,” I say, but in such an apologetic way that he replies, “No, that’s okay. ” At the end of the street he changes his opinion on the matter, however, and yells out, “You know what? Never mind. Fuck you, then! I’ve got nothing left to lose!” and drops his pants, walking naked from the waist down for several blocks before a police cruiser comes along. He is the second pantsless man I’ve seen in Portland today. 107 I try calling Dalileh from Coffee Time. She doesn’t answer. Growing antsy, I walk to the park, humming to myself. “You’re entirely too happy,” a gal says to me. As always, my vision is bad, so from where I am, I can’t tell whether I know her or not. As it turns out, I do: I had talked to her earlier at Coffee Time. I sit down and we discuss the meaning of conversation and what it is that people tend to discuss. Then Dalileh shows up. When I called she was just driving towards Coffee Time, so when she didn’t find me there she figured that I might be at the park. We decide to rent Dancer in the Dark, since she has never seen it and I never finished watching it myself. As we approach the car, we run into Caleb, who says that he would love to come along and watch it with us. On our way, Long-haired John calls Dalileh. She invites him to watch the movie with us, but he has seen it already and doesn’t feel emotionally capable of handling it again. He warns Dalileh about the nature of the movie. She’s reluctant to suggest a change of plans, but I insist that it would be fun to pick up John and just hang out instead. So that we would have the option, though, we rent the DVD before going to pick up John. We then go to Coffee Time, stay there awhile, go back to John’s, watch Legend and fall asleep on the bed. In the morning, Dalileh has to leave for work. She says that I can stay at her apartment while she works. I do. I eat at the Subway down the street and sleep until she gets home. We watch Dancer in the Dark. Although Dalileh generally doesn’t smoke these days, she asks me for a cigarette afterward. We get fast food and decide to take it to a park. While looking for a parking spot, we see Kat. We yell for her to come and join us. she does. Kat invites us over to her house. Dalileh declines; I accept. 108 Memories in the making, the sort that leave less of an impression than makes sense. In water of the natural sort I watch, keeping myself close to the earth, close to myself. I watch the modesty of others and it makes me blush. Peace to me is not the present; it is the murmur of what it all is for. 109 Water ripples. She doesn’t know how to play the flute. She does it anyway. 110 My newest companion is a backpack, graciously donated to my cause by Kat. Here is the feeling: grass, movements, silence, pure white, pure color, flowers growing in the wild, and if I reach for a cigarette it’s that I’m acknowledging once more the somewhat dark truths of the life that I was born into. My visit to Kat’s home along the Columbia River Gorge coincided with her mother going out of town for a few days. The stage was set, then, for an escape from civilization’s yanking grasp. 111 Feeling dew on blades of grass against coffee, cigarettes, commenting on job classifieds. We taint ourselves and our surroundings. I wish that I had a hammock. 112 Look at this, look at this. Hearts touch for shimmery, momentary collaboration. 113 In my universe, although I never stop coughing, although my sinuses are never clear, although I need uncommon amounts of sugar to remain conscious, although my vision deteriorates, I am perfectly all right, I am, because hey, I have always been told that I’m all right, spoiled by the fact that when I have a friend, I don’t just take a lick of the toppings, I consume right down to the crust, and they meld with me in my stomach and soon they’re the humans and I’m the slice of pizza, and love and death are all I know. 114 A party V. and Jack take me to in Vancouver, Washington, at Laurie’s. Good people are around, although not so much excitement for an outsider. I lie on the tiled floor of the kitchen, on my stomach, with my legs up in the air. 115 Left V. to walk as I didn’t wish to do, couldn’t deal, to quite an extent it doesn’t matter much to me anymore, so I talked to strangers at Coffee Time about how cats are going to evolve and dominate the earth, but the girl with the cute kitten wasn’t amused and as I’m getting used to happening in small groups there was the figure present to change the subject without acknowledgment after everything I spoke (to talk about this hot guy, that hot guy, and one of the faceless males I couldn’t pick out of a police lineup approaches and gets the attention she had angrily been trying to give to nothing at all). 116 I went on a picnic with Cesily today. She brought along her cousin Jeremy and I brought along Lauren. We went to the rose garden, sat in a circle holding hands in the sensing of energies, then went to Lauren’s, drank beer and wine and had great talks about relationships and the dumbness of dumb stuff. I draw stars on the pages, stars on the pages, stars, stars. 117 Portland State University. Walking around looking for places to apply for work, I’ve dropped off one application so far. Bite my pencil. These birds are sharing the crumbs. That’s special. These birds are scared by one gal’s cell phone. I wish that I had a guitar. Wishing is weird. But I go over my own songs again and again in my head. I wish that I had some food for you, birds. I wish I knew how to figure out where to buy stamps: I would mail my letters. 118 If you win the grand prize of a million dollars from the latest McDonald’s promotion, you have the option to be paid in gold or diamonds or cash. 119 Star. Star. You have so much time, star. But don’t forget that you’ll be too old once you reach the present to expect anyone else’s wisdom. People hide within wisdom, sucked away in enlightened disinterest. 120 Little bits of memory come back that are fun little tidbits of my world. I had forgotten, when I believed in things other than the green in the leaves— green, just want to gaze, lie, peace, calm, funny for one who has been chaos, chaos. Let’s hurry up: we can’t relax quickly enough. 121 “You’re always in love?” and I nodded. 122 Damien from Coffee Time said to me that he has outgrown everything he’s come to know of the world, that he had an angel tell him it’s time for him to move forward into adulthood. I drew him a diagram of how we keep expanding, and how our environment and the universe we shape for ourselves needs to expand from its encasement of us, how this means that sometimes we need to feel small within our worldview, so that we have the room to grow into. I performed music for the first time on the west coast at the Mojo’s musical Open Mic. There they allowed three songs, so I played “Flight of the Angel”, “I Melt” and “So Frolic the Immortals” on somebody else’s guitar. I hadn’t been able to practice for at least a week prior to stepping up to the mic, so I was shoddy overall. The first song seemed to come out pretty well, though. I used my new hand-held cassette recorder to preserve the event. I’ve spent the past couple nights with Kat. Tuesday night at her house, in the sunroom, on the futon with her. Wednesday night, in the back of her car parked outside of Lewis and Clark State Park, because she was too tired to drive back from Portland. 123 I wake up at Long-haired John’s. He and Kat are chatting. “You slept for a long time!” I’m told. “I slept for, like, five and a half hours!” “That’s a long time!” And we go to a Mexican restaurant. I don’t get anything. After John leaves to wander, Kat and I fill our moments before meeting Dalileh by going to Powell’s, then Rocco’s. Kat seems to be against the idea of reaching Coffee Time too soon. She seems to sense that I would like to be there, though, since Coffee Time has become my method of communication with most of the world. Phone? Internet? Nah. You run into people at coffee shops. That’s how it works. I have another interview, for a particular Plaid Pantry location, on Monday. As I look at my coffee, the reflection of leaves upside-down seems the foreground, with the brown/tan color of the actual drink as the background. The leaves of that tree are the color of grapes. Weird. I didn’t know that trees came in that variety. "

    "body": "124 Kat’s mother asks to see my driver’s license. I show it to her, through Kat’s objections. “Did you know he’s really twenty-eight?” she asks Kat. “Yes,” she says. “Really? Because he’s not. I was just seeing how you would respond. ” Then Kat says that she’s going out to do some things and asks if I’d mind staying around the house while she’s gone. I say that I would prefer to wander. Much to my glee, her family’s two dogs follow me as I walk. They’re beautiful. It’s my heaven. 125 The puppies gone, I’m left to my own blowing hair. This is where I write. The winds are large, you see. Minor conveniences are not minor, you see. Kestrel called me Kerouac, but I haven’t such __ to my walks. The wind starts to annoy me and it’s a little bit cold, but my body, this body, is just one body—it isn’t a big deal. And I know that that feelings and ideas exist in the same way that I do; that even they who change the timelines are limited and will run out of permutation just as we run out of time. 126 Kat’s mother calls to me from her car. She asks me whether I have eaten. I say that I grabbed a snack from the convenience store. She tells me that I can eat when I get back to the house. 127 Lauren, Cesily and I in Lauren’s apartment. We all chatted happily and smoked cigarettes, sitting on Lauren’s bed. Cesily hummed “I Want To Hold Your Hand”, which was my cue to hold her hand. I really liked her for this. Then, Cesily and I walked through a part of the city with which I was unfamiliar. “Is this place open?” “No, it couldn’t be. ” We were beautiful. The place was indeed open. It was some Chinese restaurant. They gave us water. “Can I have some?” “Me too. ” “Now we’re water brothers,” said Cesily. It was my first time hearing this term. The three of us hadn’t had the money to marry each other at the Church of Elvis, but we had scribbled poems about love on the urban playground blacktop, in chalk. We were hoping to climb the bridge, but the entrance to the stairway was locked. We sat. The wind was cold to me, but they didn’t mind, so I tried not to. I thought that I loved us, then. I did. I thought that I was crazy. The moisture of the night was fantastic. I went to get the last of my stuff from V. and Jack’s place. The living room was covered with lots and lots of the DJ’s stuff, including a hookah, next to which V. lay incapacitated. Jack lightly rubbed her back. I took my stuff, said goodbye, thanked Jack for all the hospitality, then left. Soon after, I’m at Cesily’s house—pets everywhere, not by her own choice. She doesn’t like animals, she says. In the morning, I get up and walk outside to the steps for a cigarette, come back inside. She’s lying on the mattress under green blankets. She’s angry at the alarm clock when it goes off. The kittens are cute. I feel cozy here. Now I look at flowers. 128 Long-haired John shows up to Coffee Time with people he met on the street yesterday, who decided somehow to come to Portland after their time at the Rainbow Gathering. He says he thinks they’re from Ashland. Meanwhile, the gal who approached the guy next to me continues to talk about dating and hot guys with a friend of hers who comes by. The guy grows more and more quiet. 129 I end up going to John’s with the Ashland people, for a place to sleep. The guy says “right on” more than anything else, while the gals seem timid. I get a life story and a half on the walk/bus ride to John’s. I sit in John’s room as tea is being prepared in the kitchen. I see a bit of glitter on my notebook page. I wonder where it came from. I think about the never-ending stream of people who come into and out of my life. I wonder how they all can mean so much when they also mean so little. 130 In the morning the sky drizzled briefly. Now the air is just humid. When I arrived for my interview at Plaid Pantry, the manager realized that I had already been through everything that he had planned for me. He told me that he was going to call my previous employers in the morning, then get back to me. Normally, I would take this as a good sign… but I did put a little fib in my application regarding my work at Nancy’s Coffee. As a “reason for leaving” I wrote down, “relocation”, although officially I had been let go for missing a shift that I had been scheduled for, coincidentally just as I was about to give my notice. I also didn’t include on my application the numbers by which my previous employers could be reached… 131 (In Notepad on a computer, Astoria, Oregon. A little refreshing to see the clarity of words typed upon a screen. ) To remember, those cliffs, the ground kept opening up more and more, and I wasn’t frightened, the landscape seemed safe, at least for me, it seemed carpeted as a mall arcade might be, only the floors opened up and I needed to jump over gaps again and again it was a cycle and I tried to help children as they lost their grip clinging to the edge and I would, but it would take no effort and so I knew somewhere that it was just a game, not real. Then, finally, as though in reward, one time when I had finished jumping the gaps, I did not return to the start. Women were around me, some walking, some dancing. I knew that I could do anything that I wanted to them. I looked around and all that I wanted was to distance myself into sadness, and I awakened next to Cesily. “(Mumble) It is really hot, though. ” She kicked the blanket off. I rolled myself to the side a bit so as not to be touching her. The moment I did, the first thought that entered my head was, “I shouldn’t have done that. Not only was my arm around her before, but her foot had come to rest slightly on my lower leg. ” Carrying on small half-asleep cross-dialogues, a line that I hear stands out: “Of course you get it, as a Spirit-ascent” (the ending title spoken quickly and definitely, as though it is a common term. ) I want to be introduced to the ideas and spirits around me, but I hesitate in doing so. Feeling a presence, I ask to the everything, “Where is she?” and the everything responds, “She is in soft script against the back wall” and I look and see the glow-in-the-dark “exit” sign that I hadn’t realized was there. I kind of laugh. After this I begin to feel wantful. I look to my sleeping friend, for a few moments plot for how I could cuddle up, but as soon as I attempt to be this methodical the appropriateness is lost. 132 Comfortably overcast sky. Just back into Portland. Time went well in Astoria: I had good chats with Cesily’s friends and drank beer to the sounds of Stevie Wonder’s Songs in the Key of Life. I see Damien for a moment. He says that he’ll soon be leaving indefinitely for the Los Angeles area. I take a short time to sit before I make calls to my Portland people. 133 If Kat and/or Dalileh show up here soon there’s a chance that I’ll be able to go to Mojo’s for the musical Open Mic. I’ve pretty much just been hanging around on my own since Cesily dropped me off. Kat told me to call when I arrived back in town, which as around 4:00; but I haven’t been able to contact her or Dalileh. I guess I’ll try calling Jack and V. ’s again, scary though that always is. 134 Kat’s here. The way she’s acting makes me say, YAWN! 135 “Creep” was playing for the second time in the span of an hour as I walked away from Coffee Time with Kat. I guess I was hoping too much for a friendly greeting, in misunderstanding of what I should have expected—(really I should expect nothing)—often I yearn for someone to feel my spirit, due to my excessive feeling of others, and in this case when it didn’t happen I was thrown off and was already feeling under the weather and she called me on the fact that I didn’t seem to be in a good mood. (Domingo in Astoria called it “having to wear shades”, because unfiltered feeling is so much to bear. ) She said that she had turned off her phone because she had felt like going to Powell’s and writing and didn’t want to be disturbed. (“People are a lot nicer to you when you’re mean”, she said—that, along with other sensitive areas being touched. ) (Then, as I thought about how controlled her projection of herself seemed to be, how unaffected, she told me to clasp my hands together. Based on a book of palmistry that she had been browsing, she told me that I was focused on the ego, on status in society, whereas she was the opposite, she worked with honest feelings. ) 136 Earlier today, arriving at John’s, I got to see a cool-looking young chick with bright red dyed hair and piercings driving an ice cream truck. Then I went to the big scary mall—also known as the Lloyd Center—and my soul was punctured when I went to Software, Etc. and with each section that I looked at, the employee working there asked, “Do you own a Game Boy Advance? Do you own a Dreamcast? Do you own a Playstation 2?” “I don’t own anything!” I confessed. Feeling unworthy, I left the store, scared away from asking whether they were hiring. When I arrived at Mojo’s I got to meet Rug, who was carrying around the documentation of his story—he lived through a brain operation that was seemingly successful, except that he insisted from that day forth that he was no longer a man, but a rug. So he changed his name to Rug and dressed in a rug. He mostly didn’t speak, but he indicated by gesturing that he was inviting me to touch him (with my shoe, naturally, as that is the proper relationship between man and rug). 137 Overheard: “Love… spirit… smell coffee. ” (Softly spoken through distance, under music,) What I’m thinking about Kat is that the best I can do is to try and connect with her when she’s around, and if she doesn’t seem to be receptive then I’ll assume that she can take care of herself, and in turn I can take care of my self. We had a talk last night at Couch Park, somewhat of a “nature of our relationship” talk. She told me that she felt I didn’t care for or respect her as strongly as she did me… but since then, she’s continued to be very distant. I don’t mind if she wants to feel free to be around me without being affectionate: that’s standard. I just don’t understand, considering how she seems to be intentionally avoiding even friendly talk with me, how last night she could have said that she felt like she was giving too much. She stated outright what I had inferred, that she doesn’t expect, doesn’t want an actual relationship or commitment. “But it bothers me when you, like, kiss other girls in front of me,” she said. I paused. “I haven’t kissed anyone other than you since I’ve been in Portland,” I said. “But Lauren tonight…” “Lauren? She kissed me on the cheek, so I, like, gave her a peck on the side of the neck. And that was probably the most affectionate we’ve been with each other. ” “I don’t know what to say, except that I don’t like having that in front of me. That hurt me. ” She went on to state matter-of-factly that when I had hugged Lauren from the couch and we had remained half-cuddled while conversation went on that it had been “more than friendly”. There’s nothing I can see right now that I could do to try and avoid making Kat uncomfortable in the future, aside from… stifling public displays of affection, apparently. But, what? Do I do this unconditionally? She didn’t like my telling her that I was hurt when she wouldn’t fulfill simple requests for hugs. There needs to be balance. Doesn’t there? 138 After Mojo’s, at Coffee Time, she and Dalileh walked in to use the bathroom. I wandered in shortly after to find Kat sitting down, waiting for Dalileh to exit. I said to her, “I’ve been playing a game. ” “With me?” she asked. “Well, I mean tonight. It’s kind of like a game. Every once in awhile I’ll look at you and try to make eye contact. It hasn’t been working. ” If she responded to this, I don’t remember what she said. “So what’s up?” I asked her seriously. “What do you mean? What are we doing tonight, you mean?” “I mean… what’s up?” Then Dalileh came out of the bathroom. Of course, this meant that any conversation I had been having was now finished with. Later, people were preparing to leave for the night, without a word or glance in my direction. Kat was walking towards the car, Dalileh next to her. Dalileh turned to say goodbye to a friend. With Kat’s guard against my initiating conversation now out of the picture for a moment, I said, “Hi,” and gave her a look. “Do you want to talk?” her exterior never budged. “Yes, I definitely would. ” She looked around. Dalileh was coming back towards us, so quickly and quietly she said, “I think we should just be friends. ” And quickly and quietly I responded, “I know, I just… wanted to have things clarified. ” Then the others returned and the small group’s jubilant conversation started up again. And later in the night, on the ride to John’s with Dalileh, finally there was a pause in conversation. “Um, Dalileh,” I say, “I don’t want to put you in an uncomfortable position, but…” She groaned, then said, “I’m sorry. Go on. ” And I asked her. Basically, I begged to be let into that world of secrets, secrets, everything a secret. She wouldn’t tell me anything about what had provoked Kat’s distancing. I’m just curious why everyone has so much to hide. Secrets were pissing me off in Massachusetts, but in Portland it feels to me like everything is secret. 139 There’s, yeah. Scribble scribble, silent, so silent in John’s basement. I poke my forehead with the back of my pen. I sit, cross-legged, notebook in lap and watch a small, scary, silvery insect wander across the floor. The sight of the insect drives me to get up and move to the couch. Hm. No cigarettes for me. Everything so decisive, so final with people. I’ve felt my friendships rather yanked away, Kat primarily and then by extension Dalileh, and reluctantly John to a degree. Should I have known? I always figure as much. I suppose I did know, but decided that it was worth it anyway. So I guess, providing that his housemates don’t resist it, I’m going to be staying at John’s now. 140 Sheer desperation—tiredness, nowhere to go, no money—led me to V. and Jack’s, where I hung out with Jon, listening to his talks about raves and DJing, and later after the twosome had returned we all watched Meet the Feebles. I go to Coffee Time to try and find a place to stay this evening. I’m pretty certain that I see Dalileh walk past me, walk inside, then walk in the opposite direction. I get up to follow, but I can’t find her. Is there something awful that I’ve been accused of doing? I don’t know. She won’t tell me, and my things are in her car. But I was able to borrow enough money from V. for coffee. Portland isn’t a tough place to be homeless, but it’s a tough place not to be able to afford cigarettes. Most will refuse to help you out, and as they do so they will give you the sort of look that makes you feel like less of a human for having asked. 141 Lauren passes by. She gives me some cigarettes just as I need them. I try to explain what’s been happening with me. She asks me to explain and words fail me and she extends her arms for a hug. Since I don’t have a big chunk of my friend base anymore, I guess I’m going to beg Jack and V. to let me stay tonight. 142 A cozy spot to sit and write by a dumpster on Hawthorne. A lot of thoughts running about my head, using my mostly not-functioning pen. I try to find a better pen in my bag. Something jabs me very deeply under my fingernail. It hurts a lot. I bleed. I get up to try and find somewhere that’ll give me change for the pay phone, which oddly enough not only costs fifty cents but also gives all operating messages in Spanish. 143 When I called Dalileh’s cell phone, she was on her way to Seattle with Kat. Kat asked to talk to me and apologized “for what happened”. I didn’t know what to say, because I still wasn’t sure what had happened. She hadn’t gotten the chance to talk to me as she wished that she could have, she said. In all honesty, the one thing that I really wish Kat had done would have been to take a little time out of her night to explain things. Nothing that one person can say to another can hurt more than the unsaid. To explain things at least would have been a gesture of respect. The second time I called, it was to get John’s number. Kat just said, “I want you to know that I do care about you. It was never that I didn’t care. Goodbye. ” So, that was that. "

    "body": "1 The only person back east I told of my impending return was Kestrel, who said that I should keep it a secret. I was hoping to return for Tuesday (Haven) or Wednesday (Word on Wednesday); but instead I’ll be there on Thursday afternoon. This train is probably the most comfortable home I’ve had for a couple of months. They give us pillows! And after we get past Spokane, there will be a smoking car! But I wish I had thought to check for pens (I’m borrowing a mechanical pencil) or batteries (I can’t listen to my CDs otherwise) at the train station. 2 I am whittling down my pencil using an electric razor, the edge of a CD case, and my fingernails. On this train I get to roam from car to car as I see fit. The refreshment bar only operates during daylight hours, but at least I can still get water whenever I want. 3 I have lots of conversation with the other insomniacs, all of them also smokers (except for the eleven-year-old). A thirty-eight-year-old man who’s a first generation American from an English family told me all the advice he had to give me about living. He told me that I should backpack through Europe, that I would fall in love with someone and never leave. We’re probably in Montana by now. Yeah, I would assume so. Northwestern Montana. Or, maybe not, I think as I look at my Amtrak America map. Maybe we’re still in Idaho. 4 I look at myself in the train’s bathroom mirror. I’m bearded now, with scraggly hair. I look to myself like I’m some wise old mystic. 5 Pulling out from St. Paul, Minnesota, as we begin to parallel the Mississippi, a man originally from South Africa expresses his excitement about seeing snow. Now that I am armed with a pen once more, it seems odd that ever I maintained my calm here without it. I listened to the conversations of teens and preteens late last night, all about masturbation and farts, thinking to myself, “Where was I at 15-16 years old?” and knowing that I was different. I sleep in brief naps. Since I have an aisle seat next to the guy who is going to Worcester, Massachusetts, I always worry that he secretly wants to get up but that my presence is obstructing that. 6 At the transit hub in Chicago I sit down at the bar and order a pizza and Pepsi. I feel like I’m disgracing the sanctity of the bar stool by not ordering anything alcoholic. (Not that I could yet, at my age. ) 7 The train going east from Chicago. Here, they’ve made the no doubt crowd-pleasing decision to place the refreshment bar—which serves beer—right next to the smoking lounge. The result is very much a bar-like environment. Guys tell me dirty jokes and I try not to make them feel too stupid for doing so. (The topics they discuss are not very unlike those of the crowd of teenagers who were on the last train. ) 8 The guy I’m sitting next to on this ride is an aspiring writer, who once upon a time ran off to Portland himself. Like me, he has grandparents in the small town of Paxton, Massachusetts. I read an unfinished short story of his, while he reads some of my play. Remaining in the lounge, listening to Jeff Buckley thanks to the aforementioned aspiring writer’s donation of AA batteries. (Toledo, Ohio is our present location. ) This is a long train, with about six cars filled by sleeping passengers. I like the experience of walking through these cars, when no one is stirring, when every person is asleep in their own unique way, some in a sitting position but with their head tilted to the side, some under blankets, in the arms of the person next to them, some on the floor, some shoeless, head against pillow against window, taking up two seats as though frozen mid-sit-up. I envy their sleep. I’ve been expending so little energy on this trip that I’ve been satisfied by brief naps after which I’m never groggy, never sour, as though I’ve simply blinked. I move on, then, to get some more water or to smoke my next cigarette. 9 As soon as I get home, I have a message in my inbox from Mandy, whom I know from LiveJournal. She writes that she’s sad about my still being in Portland, she regrets that we never got to know each other. Well, hey, how are ya? I’m back! I also have an email waiting for me from Lauren in Portland, saying that she has plans for something she wants to do with me and Cesily. By the time I receive this email, the date she proposed for us getting together has already passed. I am unable to reschedule, for obvious reasons. 10 I wake up on Friday night, go to Northampton, and come upon Charlie and Harvey. “What the fuck?!” Harvey exclaims. “When did you get here?!” We walk along the sidewalk. Jonny is coming our way, but he doesn’t see me at first and is walking on disinterestedly when Charlie says hi. Then I make myself obvious to him and he says, “Oh, wow! Hi!” and gives me a hug and joins the group of us. I go for a walk with Jonny and talk with him about music for a bit. Then we come back, Jonny leaves, Alice and Social Worker Michelle happen by, they get sucked in with us, we go to Herrell’s because Charlie says that Delphine is working. We get ice cream there, and she requests that we wait around until she gets off work. During this time Robyn comes by. She sticks around only for a little bit before leaving. Delphine gets out of work. Alice and Michelle are getting tired, so they leave. Delphine, Charlie, Harvey and I go to the Whately Diner, where Delphine keeps acting amazed by the others’ interactions. Delphine takes off for home, then I drop off Charlie and Harvey. I get home and talk to Lori online. We decide to meet up immediately for coffee, at 5 AM at the Holyoke Denny’s. We have a pleasant chat about persons, places, and things. I find out from my mom that the house is going to be exterminated and that I therefore will need to be away from it for a while. By now the sun is well up and it’s Saturday morning and I take my guitar with me and drive in the direction of Northampton, but get sidetracked and stop at the Tailgate Picnic in South Hadley. Then I take a wrong turn instinctively and find that I’m going towards the Hampshire Mall, so I go there and talk to Comic Book Scotty, who is working at the comic book store. I finally head to Northampton, play guitar on a bench, get some coffee, walk around, see nobody, then head home. I’m feeling artistic, so I decide that I want to get the book I’ve put together—the first in a series of chronological collections of my writing—copied and bound. I call my Aunt Cheryl, who now lives upstairs, to ask permission to use her computer to print out one copy, since my printer doesn’t work. I do that, then go to Northampton with the intention of going to Kinko’s. On my way I run into Jonny and get sidetracked into sitting and people-watching for a little before heading to do what I had been planning. For two hours I fold my papers and place them perfectly on the xerox machines, then hand everything in to be bound. I eat for the first time in a while by buying a slice of pizza. Then I pick up my book; it’s pretty. I sit around for a bit, go to Fire &amp; Water, run into Robyn briefly (although she acts very occupied with the person she’s there with). I go back home, it’s nighttime, but then I remember that Erica B. ’s party is tonight. I get my shoes on again and go there. The first person I see at the party is Michelle O. , who gives me a warm welcome and says, “Here, want to meet some people?” and introduces me to the first bunch of people around. One of them, named Brenna, mentions James Iha in the first sentence she says to me, so we end up talking about The Smashing Pumpkins for about a half hour. I get good talks in with Michelle about relationships. I get introduced to somebody as “Levi, he dated Sarah N. ” and whimper, “I’ve accomplished more than that, you know!” It becomes apparent that Brenna is having issues having to do with a guy. She starts to get upset and cries a little, so Michelle leads us to a secret pizza that she had brought and stashed away. We eat. The cops come because of a noise complaint; they tell people to quiet down. Anne-marie grabs me by the arm to help find her friend. We run into some other people trying to find the same person, and at that point Anne-marie is semi-hyperventilating due to a combination of alcohol and my irreverent comments about Sheryl Stoodley’s interpretation of the Suzuki Method of theater training. The people we have stumbled across ask Anne-marie whether she’s all right, looking concerned as if they think that I’ve just punched her in the gut or something. The missing person is found again and all is well. I go inside to where people seem to be settling down, talk to Danielle F. , until on the other side of the room Brenna freaks out and yells at the guy she’s having issues with, who’s cuddling with some girl, “You have to do that in front of me, don’t you?! What the fuck!” and storms out. All I actually get to hear said by the guy in question is, “I have a foot fetish,” although I hear him say this about five times. A minute later, I hear Michelle call my name from out the window. To help calm down Brenna they’re going to the Holyoke Denny’s along with Lynn, and I’m invited along. The party’s winding down anyway. I say my goodbyes and we go to Denny’s and I drink coffee while we all talk about this and that. Then, we part ways and I go home. 11 Lauren, Kat, and Dalileh all stop writing in their LiveJournals. Lauren and Cesily won’t return my emails. I immediately find myself out of touch with everybody I met in Portland except for those in V. ’s inner circle. 12 July 30, 2001. I was born to be a writer, it’s all I can do and yet I can’t do that at all, really. Perhaps I was born to be a typist—a selective typist. Perhaps, perhaps, and I used to believe that others were better off for having known me. Self-glorification, that standard business. I feel embarrassed sometimes. If someone doesn’t want to respect me, there’s not much standing in their way. Yow! my life is too crazy. I’m just over that edge. I’m just riding out a fall, just moving, moving. 13 Aug. 4, 2001. I talked Brielle into getting coffee with me Wednesday morning. I walked to the IHOP, sweating a good deal. I went inside and although not getting a table, I asked for water. I received a glass cup, the contents of which I emptied quickly. While drinking I remembered that this location was where previously, in vastly different periods of my life, I had met Ryan and Audrey for the first times… (Wait! What? Ryan? How could that possibly be? It doesn’t make sense that I would forget where I first met Ryan in person. I met him at the Ames Department Store: I remember it, clear as day! How many times must I have recalled that story between the years 1997 and 2001? Like a bazillion times! If I can’t remember that—”I”, having all this proof of my memories, trapped in numbered volumes of archives kept in binders, on my hard drive, backed up on CD, hosted on the Internet… Yes, here I am, in the later part of the first decade of the twenty-first century, interrupting the text, tainting it, underscoring how difficult it is to be sure about what happened in the past…) Brielle arrived. As I walked with her to the Ocean State Job Lot so that she could buy inexpensive organic coffee, she reminded me that she would soon be a quarter of a century old. I sat in the car as she bought gas at BJ’s Wholesale Club. I accompanied her for errand-running at the Holyoke Mall. We went to the pet store after that. I looked at the ferrets and she looked at the tarantulas. I went to Necrology on Wednesday night. Conor was there; I thought to ask him if he would want to go on a trip to New Jersey the next day. He said yes. At the Denny’s afterward, conversation came about between the goths at my table and the blond-haired women in white across from us. Kestrel recalled the “nature of reality” conversation that I had initiated at Mick’s party. My first experience as a passenger in Conor’s car was Thursday, when he drove the entire way from Chicopee, Massachusetts to Atco, New Jersey. He did not kill us. I was impressed. At a gas station, Conor and I waited for Colquitt B. (my longtime Internet friend) and rae (someone else Colquitt and I know from the Smashing Pumpkins chat room days). They arrived, and we sat around in the grasses before being joined by her quiet friend Dan. All of us drove down the street towards Wal-Mart. “Disarm” came on the radio. rae and I were pleased and excited. Colquitt pretended not to be delighted. At Wal-Mart, we chased a stray kitten that refused to be caught. rae summoned her friend Tesa. We went and sat at the train stop. I asked Tesa for her life story. Tesa began, but didn’t make it far before deciding that she didn’t want to continue. We took the train to Atlantic City. I slept on the way there. We went to the rather violent beach with its “caution” sign. rae, Tesa and I all walked in the water a little bit. On the boardwalk, fudge was eaten. We admired animatronic characters at the Wild West Casino; although not designed as such, these were representations of several deadly sins direct from Hell. I would later find out that my Aunt Kim was coincidentally in Atlantic City at the same time that I was. It’s unfortunate that I didn’t happen to run into her. That would have been amusing. We ran to catch the train back. Noting that Colquitt and I were in front of everyone else, I said, “Smokers in the lead!” at which point the two of us began a quick racing sprint, which we soon thought better of. Miscommunication led to rae having to pay extra for the rest of our broke asses since we didn’t have the time to buy train tickets in advance. She also wasn’t happy about the running aspect of our transit. I felt bad. Back in Atco, we went to the Palace Diner. Everyone used my U. S. atlas to show off their home states. Primarily between Conor and Colquitt, a conversation developed about Atlantis, aliens, God, pyramids, and Billy Corgan. We went back to rae’s to get directions to Anya’s house in Philadelphia, where Colquitt was staying and wanted to get back to. In the beginning it seemed that just one person was going to drive him, but as it turned out all six of us crammed into a car for the trip. Blanketed in the backseat, I lay on rae who lay on Colquitt who commented, “You know, I don’t think I ever expected to be cuddled up in a car with these particular people. ” Often uncertain of our exact location, we were driving in circles through Philadelphia for a while; but as we reached Anya’s, Colquitt admitted that in a way he didn’t want the ride to end quite yet. We said our farewells to him, then returned to the vehicle. Dan, who was driving, took us in and out of Philadelphia for about an hour and a half before finding a familiar route to where we were going. The sun was out by the time we were back at rae’s. Conor and I slept on the futon until the early afternoon. I drove on the way back, navigating us this time around rather than through New York. Traffic was still obnoxious through North Jersey, but we were in no hurry. 14 My Memé said that my Kindergarten teacher, who lives in her neighborhood, won’t stop asking to see me. Apparently I had been a favorite student of hers, and she had mentioned my incredibly high I. Q. (I didn’t know that I had ever had my I. Q. measured. ) 15 On the street, a Christian approached me and some people I was with today. He ignored everything that I said and instead gravitated toward a debate with the guy who said, “Christians are just Pagans in denial. ” “I’d rather be loving my neighbor,” I said, and walked away. 16 I performed music at Fire &amp; Water—poorly—and watched other musicians bond and ignore me. As they played on my guitar I talked to a woman about her planned intentional family. It hurt as usual that I don’t know family in any sense, don’t connect to other humans most of the time, just appreciate and love as an outsider. (Why am I compelled to write songs with no one to hear? A tree falling in the woods, with no one to hear me, do I make a sound?) 17 Downtown Springfield, I park on main street and a guy asks me for a cigarette and I say, “Sure,” in a now very casual and accepting fashion, and the guy standing next to him adds, “Got another one for an Irishman?” and I say, “I don’t care about any of that, here you go,” and he says, “Nah… Lithuanian?” and I reply, “No,” handing him two cigarettes, and he says, “What, then?” and I say, “French” and he says, “Ah, French-Canadian,” and I nod and I say, “Have a good night” and I walk towards the bus terminal, where I find Tina. She says that after all the time she’s spent in transit on this day (coming from eastern Mass) she’s never been happier to see me. Next I’m at Necrology, the all-ages goth night. The band Collapse into Reason is playing. Liz—a gal I met and cuddled with extensively last night at Haven—takes me by the hand to make introductions. I feel like I’m being shown off. I’m flattered. Fuller, everyone’s favorite mathematics-loving psychonaut, shows off representations of four-dimensional planes. I express bewilderment to him that while playing “one potato, two potato” the numbers are counted upward until “seven potato, more” and yet there are never more than four potatoes (represented by fists) at any point in the game. I accuse him of having stolen the first four potatoes. I make a new friend in a gal from Ware named Katie. She’s a thinker; we discuss literature and communication. She is bombarded by the peer pressure of having LiveJournal mentioned by just about everyone she meets, and becomes, after Liz and Tesa, the third person I’ve helped convert to the service in the span of a week. 18 Even singing Christmas carols with Jonny can’t change the fact that it’s too hot for a human to function properly. 19 At 11:30 AM I use sidewalk chalk to write, “Where’d you park the car?” in the lot. I buy a sandwich for Jonny and me. In line, another person recognizes us from the Lowell ‘00 Smashing Pumpkins show. A guy tells everyone to cheer when he holds up and un-pops my stuffed Popple. They do. I meet Maurice and Kim at the T stop. They broke up recently but are still living together. It shows. She seems okay, but he seems down. I unethically let them join us at the front of the line. We’re told not to run when they let us in, so I skip instead. We’re at the front, against the barricade. I tap a gal I recognize on the shoulder and say, “Excuse me, but haven’t I seen you at every concert I’ve ever been to in my life?” and she’s always at the front of the line. She remembers me too. The guy behind me, from Connecticut, was also at The Smashing Pumpkins’ United Center Farewell show, just like I was. The show makes me realize even more intensely the genius of Radiohead. I failed to meet up with Yulya, though. The next time I go to a large-scale quality concert such as this, I should bring along a sign that reads, “LiveJournal Users Community Center”. 20 Jonny: “My brain feels like it’s just tossing out everything that’s in there. It’s screaming, ‘Abort mission! Abort mission!’” Me: “That sounds sad. ” Jonny: “Not really. Neer! Neer! Neer!” 21 "

    "body": "22 (Some of these chapters/entries were written several years after the events transpired. I’ve inserted them into the narrative in order to cover ground that my journals at the time did not. What follows is one such chapter/entry. ) Tina said that we should hang out. We were outside of the Whately Diner, sitting on a rock. Seemingly out of nowhere, we kissed extensively. We drove back to her apartment. But we parked. We were listening to Radiohead’s “How To Disappear Completely”. We kissed. Thom Yorke sang: “I’m not here/this isn’t happening” and after, Tina commented, “I really like this song,” not having heard it before. Tina talked to Mick for advice on throwing a party at her mom’s house. Her mom’s house was a significant distance from the Valley, but in fact lots of people came, from all around. I was to meet Mandy here for the first time. Before long I was melting to the ground from the head scratchies she and several other people were giving me. That continued on a couch inside. Then someone took my shirt off, and someone else joined in with a furry glove that had scratchy claws at the fingers. I think I was pleased enough that I started nibbling an ear at one point, not knowing, not caring whom I was nibbling. Then the cops came because of a noise complaint. Tina cried. They left. A lot of people cleared out after this, including Bluejay, the cab driver with whom I briefly conversed, who maybe gave me their LiveJournal contact info at that point? As the party wound down I hung out on the floor and made out with Mandy, who then went upstairs to change into her pajamas. I awoke in the morning on the couch next to her. We went outside on a porch so that I could have a smoke. We were talking. Kestrel suddenly climbed over the railing from down below on the other side. It was just past sunrise. Later, I was cuddled up next to Mandy again. Lydia and Liv came downstairs together. As Mandy and I stared into each other’s eyes, Liv said, “There he goes, transcending reality again. ” My ride had left the night before. I was catching a ride with Lydia and Liv, who I think were seeing each other or something at the time. So it went. We stopped at a Bickford’s—or maybe it was a Denny’s—on the way. “You know what I just realized?” I said to the two of them, “My life is unorthodox. ” (I regret the disjointedness of this and some other portions of my narrative. ) 23 “Clean up after your dog children play here” is written in chalk at Pulaski Park in Northampton. 24 Aug. 30, 2001. I’m sleeping for the second time of the day when Delphine calls from her cell phone. She and the others who are around Noho request my company. I shave, shower, and drive up. It’s my first time seeing her since she shaved her head. She, Jonny, Alice, Social Worker Michelle and Harvey are outside of Fire &amp; Water. We get free ice cream and talk about silly things before going to the Whately Diner and talking about more silly things. 25 Filling out the form for my GED testing. Last grade completed: 8. 26 And I sleep again. For about 45 minutes. On and off. I wake up and pee, sitting down, as I do when I’m lazy and don’t feel like standing. I step out under the stars and smoke a cigarette and think about plans and try to diagnose myself, feeling weighed down, muddy, like I’m a few seconds behind at all times. I want macaroni and cheese. There’s nothing to stop me from cooking macaroni and cheese, but if I did this I would be likely to rouse my mother, who rests upstairs in a bedroom connecting to the kitchen. And she might likely begin talking to me, and ask me what my plans are for the coming day, or tell me about things that matter. But I don’t want things to matter. I just want to eat some macaroni and cheese. Nervously, I highlight random bits of text on my screen. The button to my pants popped off earlier in the night. I don’t want to bother to change my pants. I don’t want to have to worry about that. I would rather be naked. I don’t want to think about these things. I’ve been thinking enough about the coming semester, the coming year, and vaguely the times after that. To make plans at all is intimidating to me. I go outside for another cigarette. What can I do here, what can I do now? I could shower, but to shower again seems like another depressing task. I miss showering at any moment I choose, to the sounds of my favorite music. So, yes, things feel a bit different now that I’m living in my mother’s basement instead of in a separate apartment above her. I lie down to sleep some more. 27 The phone rings. It’s Heydi, from F. Y. E. , f. k. a. The Wall, the music store at the Holyoke Mall. This is the music store where Jonny used to work, owned by the same company that owned Saturday Matinee. Heydi used to work with me there; so did Dawn, with whom, I’m told, I should come to have an interview. I say okay, happy to have found something productive to do. I arrive. Dawn says that an interview wasn’t really needed, but she takes me to the back room and asks a few questions anyway. She says it’s perfect that I’ve applied, that I’ll just have to interview with the store manager when he comes back from vacation. She tells me that he’ll be back on Tuesday and to give him a call then. 28 I sit on the sidewalk, reading. Nashville Brian sits down next to me and starts telling jokes about Sylvia Plath. “Why did Sylvia Plath cross the road?” “Why?” “To follow artistic impulse. Why did she cross the road again?” “Why?” “Uh… I don’t know. I was going to say, ‘To kill herself’, but that’s not funny. ” I bring up the subject of how many of the best known American poets were connected to this area. “Like Robert Frost,” he says, “Who’s boring. ” I agree with him, so he begins expressing this viewpoint to random passerbys: “Robert Frost is boring! I don’t like Robert Frost. Hey! Little girl! Robert Frost is boring! Remember that when you get to him in the first grade! [Two police officers walk by. ] I hate Robert Frost!… Hey, did he just put his hand on his gun when I said that?” 29 Aug. 31, 2001. My friend Jason and I were the most badass computer kids at Chicopee Comprehensive High School in ‘95-‘96. We never stopped laughing about the clique of kids who tried to feign know-how, who’d say things like “Man, I wish I could do something with those AOL disks I always get in the mail, use ‘em as blanks or something. ” These days, though, I’m pretty clueless when it comes to technology, and I’m skeptical of what we’re doing with it. We pay for designated lines; designated IP addresses; we pay for our “fast lane” pass and Visa check card to have our information collected; we pay to communicate so that we can feel like we’re better people than the media has told us we are so that we can feel sorry for ourselves and for all of our friends so that we can pay to counteract our depression. Everyone who has bought a pre-built computer package from Best Buy has not only contributed to ye olde retail market, incorporated, but has also contributed to the continuance of wide-scale distribution, royalty checks for the pre-packaged music samples. Advertisers know the words you see in those unused icons when you click an item on your active desktop, so in that way alone they know how to keep running the game. And it’s justifiable, from an American standpoint. Tough to turn back from. Big shot corporations employ non-Americans to assemble parts, so there’s more money floating around for the corporation to advertise to Mister and Missus Suburbia that yes, they can afford to take out a loan for a second car… so there’s a job for the woman who gives them the loan, who has her job because she’s a “people person”. We’re manipulated so entirely into believing that we do “good” things. But the things we don’t think about, well, they still have their ramifications. Someone out there is thinking about the results of our unconsidered actions. Maybe it’s best that we don’t think about it at all… I hope that big brother knows what he’s doing. For now I’m just going to try to be little, scurrying around like the ant that I am, making out to the bad karma of the radio. 30 Sitting on “Hippie Hill”, as it was sometimes called. A frequent hangout spot for kids in general as they sat around the center of Northampton and hung out. All we did was hang out. Patrick and I were there. The town was full of incoming Smith students, who were in town now but who hadn’t started classes yet. Somehow, a conversation between Patrick and me, and maybe involving some other folks, integrated with a conversation between some of the college freshman. And ladeeda, we chatted and said hello and exchanged names. Everybody wanted to go back to their respective dorm rooms to sleep, but one of them, named Agatha, who had been particularly interested in the conversation (or something) opted to stay while her classmates went back to the campus. As the weather began to get chilly, she invited Patrick and I up to her dorm. The dorm was barren. Nothing had been unpacked yet. Her roommate hadn’t even arrived. Her bed had no sheets on it. This was the very day she had moved in. We chatted about this and that. Patrick eventually said he was getting tired and we all walked down to the exit. Agatha and I looked at each other and she asked, was I leaving, or would I like to stay a little longer? I said that sure, I’d stay a little longer. Back upstairs, I asked her about her perception of me. She said that at first she was a little scared of me, because I seemed too nice not to be hiding something. She turned the inquiry around on me. I told her that she seemed fragile. When she heard me say that, she took a dominant position on top of me and put her lips to mine. I take off one of her socks. She says something about unfairness and takes off my shirt. I touch her, kiss her body, but don’t see much of a response. I try putting more energy in and she says, “Do you think you could calm down a little?” I nod and say of course. “I’m kind of scared of sex,” she says, “I’ve only ever really had sex with one guy. ” She says the problem is that she always ends up trying to give people what they want, and that she assumes with males it’s sex. “I’m sorry,” she says. I say that it makes no sense to apologize to me when I’m lucky enough to be curled up next to her like this. We put our clothes back on and go outside, at first planning to part ways because it’s sunrise now and she has plans for the next morning. Over the course of a cigarette she changes her mind, though, and asks if I want to get coffee. We go to the DB mart, buy coffees, and sit on a bench on main street, holding hands and talking. I realize that I’ve forgotten my books at the DB mart, so we go back to retrieve them and then sit down in the parking lot. Eventually, I drive her back to Smith. We kiss goodbye. I drive home. 31 Erica B. ’s end-of-summer party. Small-scale. I talk to Jonny outside on the steps, bringing up his mood. We go into town and skip around. I direct the police to a guy who had escaped from a hospital, passed out inside of Fire &amp; Water, then stumbled out. At the counter with a cappuccino, in the midst of a rant about the inability of words to describe feelings, I say the word “innocence” and everyone in earshot seems to be brought to attention. 32 Mandy returned to school at Springfield College. I went to visit. I told her about Agatha, said that I wasn’t going to promise that nothing was going to grow with Agatha, that I didn’t know how she (Mandy) felt about that, what she wanted to do, etc. I was really quite serious about it; but eventually I said, “I wish I could still kiss you” or something and she said something like, “Um… okay!” Her energy was odd. I thought to myself that she seemed annoyed when I wasn’t kissing her… like everything else was a waste of her time. 33 Sep. 5, 2001. Astronomy lab with Professor Budd—who, word has it, aside from scientific understanding also has exquisite pie-making skills. He reviews scientific notation for the sake of the forgetful. I fish through my Jansport backpack, which once held all that I needed to live through directionless wanderings in the Pacific Northwest. I feel the pencil that I whittled down with miscellaneous apparatuses on the train ride east, an empty Marlboro box from god-knows-where, and the sidewalk chalk once used with Lauren and Cesily to decorate a playground’s blacktop with poetry, sketches, and Pagan symbols. Finally, I locate a pen. Ethan is sitting behind me. That’s funny. Sarah H. is sitting next to me—which is also funny, because she took this class with me the last time I started taking it, then stopped showing up. 34 Sep. 7, 2001. I never wanted to be cool. I just wanted to feel like I was human. I wanted to triumph over nervous tics and the frustrations that churned up my insides for days on end. I wanted to be cared for. I wanted to be listened to. I wanted to be able to make a difference in someone’s life. I wanted to know love. Also… I wanted people to read each other’s journals. I saw early on that the Internet offered the possibility for something that would allow for that. 35 Sep. 8, 2001. Like some people will get distracted from a conversation because the television’s on, I get distracted from the television because a person’s on. I don’t talk much, although people sometimes think that I do because I always know when and how to change the subject. 95% of what I say is interrogative. I can’t blend in. I would stand out naked and bald in a lineup of naked, bald people. I don’t recognize most of my friends when I see them. Bad vision, bad visual memory. I remember their favorite shirts better than I remember their hair color. I remember eye color better than hair color. I remember posture better than anything else. Sometimes, in small groups, I smile at things that I shouldn’t smile at. If I don’t smile, people worry about me. I’m often confused about what I’m like, about my role in anything. Your teacher used to pull me down in front of the blackboard. You watched filmstrips on me. 36 Sep. 8, 2001. I faced an entirely disappointing rendezvous with Agatha today. [Dial number. Tell her I’m at the doors. Wait for her, smoke cigarette, sit on curb. Skip over to her. She gives me a look, says she’s not used to guys skipping. She looks distant. I talk to her, listen to her tell me what’s new— a reluctant explanation of books she’s reading for class. Drive to convenience store, buy sodas. Extend my arms for a hug, watch her wordlessly walk to the car, ask if she didn’t want a hug, she shakes her head no, not speaking, after more silence I ask why she seems so down, she says she’s intimidated by school, missing her old boyfriend. She asks if anyone will be around town, I try not to feel hurt by this, as I have a history of feeling used as a way into the company I keep. I say there’s usually someone in town, ask if that means she just wants to hang there. Again, I try not to be disappointed, but I want to talk to her—TALK to her—and she is only barely speaking, at all, to me. From there on I only follow her around, let her lead where we go, stay silent. Sit quietly in the bookstore until she’s ready to go, without speaking still. Follow her to a hill, she says, “I was looking so forward to this, and now I just want to be home. ” Pause. “I can drive you back if you want. Oh. You mean home. ” More silence. She: “I’m sorry I made you come all this way. ” Silence. She: “I’m going back. ” “Do you want a ride?” “No. ” She leaves, then, comes back once I’m chatting with others, joins in, goes for a walk with Patrick. ] 37 I’m invited to tag along with Lydia and Liv for a party at Lydia’s place. Cigarettes more than slightly crushed in my pocket, I set them down on the old carpeting. Angry industrial music blares, and underneath this—which passes as background music—someone plays with the MTV Music Generator for Playstation. Coffee was prepared by the guy they call Duckman. I attempted to pour a cup for myself, but the milk curdled. 38 Sep. 9, 2001. Lydia gave me a piece of art. Scraps of photos of me and Tina, one of me, one of her. Timeless, timeless, timeless. Right now I just want to be held. I steal support from Tina now. I don’t feel bad about it. I’ll make her hug me, because I know that even if she’s otherwise occupied at the moment she’ll at least be willing to give the gesture. 39 Sep. 11, 2001. Past midnight, before going to sleep. I still didn’t have a bed to sleep on, there in my mother’s basement. Mandy was staying over. We slept together on my couch. We woke up later than planned. At about 11 AM we finally awoke. I rushed to drive her back to her college. In the car we listened to cassette tapes. "

    "body": "1 I dropped off Mandy, then drove to Holyoke Community College. When I arrived I noticed that there seemed to be an unusually large number of students leaving the campus, while I was the only one just arriving. A guy who occasionally did tech work for Drama Club productions said hello to me. I asked him why everyone was leaving. “You didn’t hear?” he said, “Oh, man. We’re, like, under attack or something. Somebody flew planes into the Pentagon and World Trade Center. And there are other planes still unaccounted for. So all the state schools and colleges are shutting down early. ” “What!” “Yeah. It’s, like, big shit. ” I didn’t leave, though. I had to walk around, to see what I could see on everyone’s face, on a day like this. I just sat around or talked to people I knew as they left their final classes of the day. I asked people what was going on. There was a plane still up in the air. Who did this? How was this affecting the work of the government? Why didn’t the television news show anything about the Pentagon? I wanted to know if our society was going to be all right. The President had been taken out of the White House. Schools were shut down, at least in this state. The footage on the television was repeating, repeating. I went to the computer terminals. This was to make me feel better. I was reading, reading, looking to hear that friends in New York were safe. There was my friends list, as usual, except with everybody freaking out. The firsthand accounts were what really got me. People watching the jumpers from the towers. I kept thinking that we might all be fucked. We might all be about to die. All that generational foresight of coming apocalypse, maybe this was really it. It seemed that we had always had dreams of this sort of thing, our generation in America bracing for the worst. 9/11 was an end of the world. I don’t even mean the innocent lives. Plenty of innocents have died violent deaths. What I mean is we, or quite a few of us, saw our worldview upended. The playground mentality, this unique and lonesome universe, a never-ending solitary journey for each of us, a journey during which the “essence”—ha! What, like a cologne?—of any one person flickered and changed… role models at our disposal. If you don’t like the cartoon you’re watching, change the channel. There are twenty, fifty, a hundred more. Use the clicker. We could be whatever we wanted to be, a pastiche of images from popular culture. An interactive generation, one with ingenuity. That’s what it felt like we were. Shouldn’t we be doing something? We’re watching TV. The Internet says that it’s a conspiracy. OUR PRESIDENT CAN’T PRONOUNCE HIS FUCKING SPEECH. No one really would care now about how I locked my keys in the car on Sunday night. We were locked into America. We couldn’t leave if we wanted to, and suddenly that seemed important. I lowered the flag to half-mast. Jonny is here and we’re going to pick up Mandy. 2 “The Pentagon is organized chaos. ” [This past Saturday through Tuesday are one entity. Greenfield, watch Tina get iced and bitten, chat, ride with Liv and Lydia. At home for a half hour. Pick up Mandy, to Whately, lock the keys in my car, call Annie, sit at her place, with Mandy on the couch, at 4 AM Tina and Nora enter, we throw a comforter over our secretly half-naked selves, talk with them a bit, listen to them play Super Mario Bros. After two hours of sleep I want to call home for keys, the phone isn’t working and I can’t figure out why, no one’s up and I’m groggy and go back to sleep. Awaken later. Find the phone was unplugged. Plug it in, no answer, hang out chatting most of the day. Late afternoon, finally get in touch with my mother, get the key. Drive with Mandy to Northampton. See the usual faces. Talk to Harvey about Agatha, he tells me to concentrate on more important matters. I grow weary of town, tell Mandy, so we leave, go to Springfield College, sit and have beautiful, complex conversation, go to her dorm, chat with her roomies, eat Pirate’s Booty, go to my place, sleeping on a couch again, wake up at 11 AM, drop off Mandy, go to HCC, get told of disaster. ] “Everyone in the C. I. A. hates everyone else in the C. I. A. ” 3 My second job interview for FYE in the Holyoke Mall had been scheduled for September 11. By the time I got there, many of the mall stores had already closed for the day. FYE was among the few that hadn’t. I was told to call the next day so that the interview could be rescheduled. Jonny called and asked if I wanted to find out whether we could still make it over the Canadian border. I said that I was sure we couldn’t. We went to Northampton instead, expecting to find lots of people there on the streets who just didn’t want to be alone. We met at Fire &amp; Water. I remember waiting in there, watching a little television set on a bar stool. Only a couple of people were in the café. Of course everyone was solemn: people were like that everywhere, walking on the streets, driving in their cars. It was like, “Dude, are you… living this, too?” 4 The Massachusetts Turnpike did not charge tolls on 9/11. That day, I overheard one conversation not having to do with the attacks. It was about topless haircutting. 5 “Protesters in Noho playing ‘God Bless America’ and waving flags and saying to bomb other countries” 6 7 I don’t want retribution. 8 I spent the vast majority of my time from Tuesday night to the present sleeping. My father emails and says that no matter what may be going on internally, I need to remember to stay focused on school, because if I’m not in school I might get drafted and die. My mother sees me as I sit on the steps to smoke a cigarette, to tell me everything’s wrong, everything’s not good, to point out what I “should” be doing, what I “should” have done. I bark, “Well NOTHING’S good, is it?!” and she tells me to “cut the shit”. I need to disconnect from the Internet now. I’m expecting a call from FYE. (“We may or may not need you to start work here tomorrow,” they’ve said. ) 9 I sit in The Thirsty Mind, drink a coffee, do astronomy homework. Then I drive to the Flywheel. Madeira notified me of his band’s show there. It’s early, they’re not slated to play for a while, and I feel awkward hanging around alone with the eight or so strangers who are there. I go to Northampton of my own volition for the first time in a while, to see if anyone’s there who might wish to accompany me to the show. I find no one. I head back and watch some of their set. It’s good, but I’m feeling sick and antsy. I leave early. 10 I hand in my Astronomy quiz. “‘Descent into madness’ is part of the theory life cycle, right?” I ask. “Uhh… yeah. Well, in your case, maybe,” says Professor Budd. 11 Club Hell, Providence, Rhode Island. It’s nice to have a change of pace from the Haven scene. This is small, dark— —I extinguish my cigarette after using it to light another— —and desperate. I watch over the secondary, out-of-service bar. When I start the pathology of rubbing my pen is when I know I need to start moving. The main issue at hand is my need to pee. When Tina leaves the dance floor I have her point me to the men’s room. I think of dancing then, and in fact I very much want to dance, but I realize that the dance floor is too crowded for me. So I sit, and smoke, and write, under blacklight. 12 Arrived late for class, feeling miserable, didn’t go, my car probably won’t start when I try to leave, and it will probably be ticketed because I don’t have a parking sticker, feeling incapable, reading email from Mandy, unreasonable desire to be held, unshaven, no money, work tonight, I’m better off as an idea than as a person. When I leave your computer screen is when the problems set in. 13 Hunched against the wall, outside the mall, feel my shoulder blades and wish for wings. A white feather skips across my line of sight, caught in the breeze. I’m glad I saw Alice. Friends rarely make me feel okay as much as she does. 14 It seems a silent moment now, outside the Holyoke Mall. Twilight. The color rose on dirtied paper.   [Cities on the east coast have absorbed the gray, it’s a part of the landscape, whereas the Pacific still fights and will contrast the smog. ]   I want wicker chairs and a hammock. And one of those nights of low-drifting cloudsover an otherwise brilliant sky.   The monotonous pulling of unwanted stock	has cleared my mind. Worksomehow seems the most relaxing thingI do. 15 Go to work, pick up Mandy in Springfield, go to Haven (now at the Pearl Street nightclub), listening to Tori Amos along the way, thinking unspeakable thought-drifts. 16 Think of all the innocent lives that were lost. Watch the buildings crumble again and again. Doesn’t that make you feel sad? Of course you’re sad. Now turn that to anger. Turn that to patriotism. Place American flags on your cars. You want those terrorists brought to justice. It sure seemed to me, walking around on September 11, that we didn’t care about any abstract notions of pride or retribution. We just didn’t want to end up dead or living in ruin. Over the course of the next couple of days, much of that fear dripped away into sadness. Now we’re living our mundane lives again and just don’t want to get drafted into a war. Our government’s been dicking around in the Middle East for a good long while now. They’re doing it for us. The blood that’s shed and that will be shed is for our picket fences, it’s for our college educations, it’s for our cars. Once upon a time, a revolution sparked something that allowed America to grow into a great empire. Do you know why we have so much? Do you know why we have complex technologies? Because a lower-class American is an upper-class human being. What’s the worst thing that could happen? We could see what places like Afghanistan have been like for years. When you wave your American flag around, you’re saying, “Might makes right”. Because it does, always, whether that image be perverted concepts of god, or whether it be television making you believe your opinion matters, when the only reason you know about anything is the fact that someone else has determined that whatever opinion you might hold won’t matter, won’t affect the master plan that will keep food coming to your mouth and not the mouths of others. The difference between LiveJournal and other media is that we are unfiltered. The Internet may in theory be low on censorship, but try to search for something important sometime. Come to think of it, when was the last time you tried to search for something you couldn’t “buy products related to”? It seems hopeless with all this clutter nowadays, right? Right. Your friends’ page is the closest you’ll get to finding truth without living it firsthand. So do you like what you see of this world? 17 Social Worker Michelle: “I’ve been worried about you. ” Agatha: “A lot of people have been worried about Levi, except for the people who’ve been really worried. ” Me: “Why?” Social Worker Michelle: “Because you’ve been looking sad. And your LiveJournal posts, sometimes. ” (Later. ) Agatha: “Every time I see you, you have people on top of you. ” Me: “(Shrug) It happens. ” (The night before. ) Agatha: “You’d be so much more fun if you just didn’t think. ” (Earlier that night. ) Mandy: “So, I’m trying to see the rationale in what led you to react like that. ” (Later that night. ) Mandy: “I always have a safety net. ” (The next day. ) Julissa: “So are you still with that girl?” Me: “Tina?” Julissa: “Oh, I don’t remember her name. You met her over the Internet and she moved in with you?” Me: “Yeah, you’d be thinking of Tina. No, I haven’t been for a while. But she’s living in the area now, in Sunderland. ” Michelle O. : “Ohhhh yeah. I remember that story. ” (A few days before. ) Passerby: “I know you. We talked before, at Fire &amp; Water. I played with your hair. ” Me: “I… really wish that narrowed it down. I’m sorry. ” Passerby: “I watched you play your songs. They were really good. ” Me: “Wow. Thank you very much. ” (In someone’s arms, the only time I feel entitled to peace. A chance to rest. My father, after talking to me, agreeing not to say what he said would make me angry, left a message, so that my mother would hear as well, of what he’d agreed he didn’t have to say— “Don’t get anyone pregnant. ”) 18 So we rest in our cocoons, waiting to become angels. 19 My co-workers discuss movies. “Moving pictures scare me,” I interject from my place sitting cross-legged on the floor. Slowly and simultaneously, they both turn their heads to give me looks of puzzlement. They must think I’m autistic or something. I don’t go into work again after that. "

    "body": "20 I was trying to locate Commonwealth Avenue by car, but Boston sucked me in and spit me out over the span of five minutes. Eventually I found my way to South Station and parked, thinking, at that point, that five dollars or so would be a small price to pay to be able to do something other than driving. And now, yup! The T it is. If all goes well, I should only be a few minutes late, even after the mishaps. Yes. 21 The T is filled by fun-loving college students. Somehow the seating I claimed, which is designed for two, squeezes in me and four or so others in various awkward and half-seated positions. I pull myself through the crowd of young bodies to meet Dina. I see a figure hunched against itself, legs against torso, as I often sit, and I know it’s her. We smoke before entering the Espresso Royale. I tell her stories of my adventure getting here. She orders coffee, black, and I order a cappuccino. She lets me know that she’s grabbing a table. As I’m sitting down, she’s getting up for something, so I look at the jukebox. It’s a good jukebox. We talk about this and that. She says that she’s learned to distrust meeting Internet people, and that she’s glad I’m not a psycho. At midnight the coffee shop closes, so we walk. She says we could try to visit Daria. We try, but she’s not in any condition to see us. Over intercom phone from the inside of the building where Daria stays, she and Dina converse at length while I listen. At Daria’s suggestion we walk to find a party that a co-worker invited her to. Once there, we gravitate towards the outside balcony. Wgile I talk to a girl from Oregon about preference being a luxury and how this applies to contemporary America, I look to Dina and watch her co-worker invade her personal space. “You’re gay!” she reminds him with several slaps to the face. We leave the party and head to a riverside bench. I tell more stories than I usually tell. Walking back towards her building, I pee in an alleyway. We say our goodbyes. It’s about 3:30 AM when I start to walk. I have eight hours to kill. 22 I walk the streets for hours as the sun rises. I’m looking for a restroom. Finally, some punks on Newbury Street suggest the Prudential Center to me. They suggest that I pee on the Prudential Center, actually, but I decide to use the toilets there instead. 23 Maurice didn’t show, but I walked through Cambridge a bit, had coffee, read. Didn’t have enough money to pay for the time I’d kept my car parked, so I had to sign a paper agreeing to send a check for ten dollars. From there I drove to meet my LiveJournal friend Peggy at Brandeis University. After some talking and sitting around the dorm she was nice enough to let me nap on her bed while she drew pretty flowers for class. I woke up to her roommate cooking. I enjoyed some rice before Peggy and I went for a stroll. The stroll led us to the water, because I like to sit by the edge of water, and I lay in the grass because I like to lie in grass, and I looked at the stars because I like to look at stars. We shared essential “so this is my world, what’s your world like?” time, conversing. I drove back without taking the highway, by choice, through lots of towns I had never seen, never had reason to see, that I somehow felt connected to. The moon was a giant blood orange slice over the trees. 24 Someone said to me recently that it seems I’m uncomfortable with my sexuality, in a way that borders asexuality. They said I never seem motivated to simply have sex with anyone, I’m so focused on cuddling and innocent affection. 25 At times, while speaking, Marie’s eyes would suddenly acknowledge their own reflection in the window. She would watch this curiously for a moment. She asked the waiter for a cup of ice that she could chomp on, while elaborating to me on the theme of love. She spoke with intensity and passion. 26 On the sidewalk, ranting to us, perplexed about world affairs. Anxious, angry: “Man, but if we don’t do something, what’s gonna happen? I’m no patriot, don’t get me wrong, I’m a communist…” The opinion-spewing stranger runs away, and James and I shake our heads. James and I never knew each other well, but I’ve watched his eyes lose connection with this world more and more. Now he looks perpetually awestruck at something others don’t see. On the subject of post-9/11 America, he says this: “If you have a brain, you will start making plans now. It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when. ” 27 Marie wipes off her eyebrows. She holds her smudged palms outstretched. “Her face, hairless…” On her lap, the Big Book of Dismal Thought, a diary that traces back to my first months of knowing her. Soft sentimental whispers into the microphone rise to crescendo, partially a revisiting of days of anguish, partially a new anguish that mourns the passing of the old. I’m in Alice’s lap as she talks to Delphine, always making those deep inhalations before explaining something. The tarot-reading guy from earlier in the night comes by, his personality gimmick being that he says, “Shocking!” to everything. 28 I hear the voice of George W. Bush from the television set in the next room as I read in the kitchen, slowly picking at a plate of breakfast food, averting my eyes every once in a while just long enough to make sure I won’t miss my mouth. 29 A walk-out of students—a war protest. Forty people or so, sitting in circles. Apparently a Five College thing, which some folks here at HCC are also following. An open microphone in the middle of campus for speaking on current events. One member of the group that helped to organize this approaches me and the guy next to me to ask us to speak. I decline, although I say that I might stop in at the next meeting to see what they’re doing. When this same person later steps up to the microphone and criticizes violence in U. S. foreign policy, several audience members begin yelling out, “Fuck Afghanistan!” “What about the three thousand people who died in New York!” and “Make Bin Laden glow in the dark!” I turn to one particularly rude heckler and say, “Hey, man, it’s an open mic. You should go up there if you want to talk. ” He doesn’t, but he shuts up. Aside from this one outburst, though, it seems that only about one in a hundred passing students even so much as looks in the direction of the people who speak. I note that it seems like there are fewer people standing around outside than if nothing had been happening at all. 30 Last night, Marie said she felt like going to her car, cranking up the heat and napping. I told her to do it and she said that I should join her, so I did and we didn’t nap but we sang along to They Might Be Giants songs and her back seat pulls down to allow access to the trunk and she crawled into said trunk by way of said pull-down backseat and I pulled the seats back up to lock her in so that she would have to escape by way of the handle which is actually inside the trunk, which lets you open it from the inside. And I talked to Social Worker Michelle, at that same little table where we’d sat after seeing Ghost World (during which, in the movie theater, she had rested her head on my shoulder). We talked about this and that, ins and outs of the human condition. I read old works of mine from high school at the open mic. 31 I was allowed 2 hours and 35 minutes to complete these two sections of the GED test. I took 1 hour and 5 minutes. 32 Robyn talks about her dancing, then says that she wants goat cheese. We go to the supermarket and she buys goat cheese. She wants to go home to unwind before sleep, then, and I’m invited to come along. I say that I’m not much in the mood for sleep—I’m too awake. She says that she wants me to be there while she eats goat cheese, though, and also for us to talk about the last time we saw each other. I’m glad that she says this. I agree. We park at the cornfields. We speak of sexuality and self and methods of personal growth. I’m so absorbed in the conversation that I don’t notice the curious positions in which the two of us lie/sit/twist up. I’m always envious of people who stick their legs out car windows, because I’m too tall to consider doing this anywhere near comfortably. I go to Fire &amp; Water for the span of a coffee after she and I have parted ways. Harvey has obtained an American flag patch and is having people write on it. He’s already marked it up with the words, “Home of the Whopper”. Spooky is carefully quoting Tool lyrics in one of the white stripes. After caffeinating myself and dispensing a couple of cigarettes to people, I drive home. 33 FROM: Lenny Levi, That was rude to hang up on me like that. That really 	pissed me off big time! Let’s not do that any more shall 	we????? Love, Dad 34 TO: Lenny Dear leonard leonard, Best regards and many “thank you”s are extended by Levi Adams for your email. Your support for his artistic endeavors is greatly appreciated. Unfortunately, due to the large volume of emails Levi Adams 	receives each day, he cannot respond to each message personally. However, your comments and/or suggestions have been noted, and will be passed onto him. Sincerely, The Levi Adams Mailroom Staff 35 Late afternoon on Halloween I awake with a slight pain in my side. I tell my mother about this and she suggests I go to the hospital, for fear that it might be my appendix. After signing my name and symptoms I wait, am called, am asked a few questions, have my blood pressure and temperature taken. I wait more. I’m called again. I give my information at the registration desk. I wait. I wait some more. My symptoms aren’t getting any worse, but my hunger is. And it’s Halloween. And I’m lonely. And hospitals are weird and scary. I tell someone that I’m leaving and do so. I go to Northampton. I shove down two slices of pizza. I meet up with people at Fire &amp; Water. I say I’m worried I’m going to die. They don’t take it seriously. My stomach is being strange, and now I can’t tell hunger from the food I just ate from the pain in my side, and I’m worried I don’t know what I’m doing and that maybe, just maybe I can’t feel well enough what’s happening with my body and maybe I’m going to die and I’ll do it with everyone acting like it’s an impossibility. And I come home and write a bit, but then I start to feel… people-wanting. And Tina comes online so I ask if I can come over and she says yes, so I do. She has a guy whose name I forget and also her LJ-using co-worker, Alicia, over and they’re all about ready to pass out. I listen to Tina tell some stories, quite contentedly, visually lost inside of a candle whose outer wax I scrape off. I forget my bag there when I leave. 36 I did go to the hospital a second time, lay in urgent care bed #11, listened to an old lady who had fallen and broken her hip moan and complain about agony until she was sufficiently doped up on Demerol, or at least enough that she kept fading in and out, staying silent for a few minutes and then moaning for a few moments again. After giving blood and peeing in a cup and staring at the curtains for a number of hours I was told that I was okay, and I left. Tonight I went over Tina’s again to retrieve my bag. She was playing Magic: The Gathering with Phil. I played Mega Man 2 on the Nintendo Entertainment System. All was well in the world. Following this I stressed myself out like the tortured artist I am, writing and drinking too much coffee and smoking too many cigarettes. I went for a walk, briefly, and bought a fifty cent pastry from the convenience store up the road. 37 Robyn: “I have to say, you’re the most pleasurable of the conquests I’ve had. ” Me: “Hm? Justify that statement. ” “What? The conquests part?” “Yes. ” “I was joking. ” “Well. I don’t believe in jokes. ” “Well. I do. ” “Okay. I believe that you believe that you believe you do. But I still don’t believe in them. ” 38 imagine talking to a friend 39 This night at the Hippodrome was my first real experience with the, erm, pop scene, I guess I could get away with calling it. I was surprised and greatly amused when I looked at the dance floor to find that no one was really dancing: they moved as I would, perhaps, while doing dishes. Only, they weren’t doing dishes. And then there were those who “danced” in close proximity to a partner; generally this consisted of motions suggestive of sexual intercourse, although often times it seemed the “dancers” were forgetting where their genitalia were, such that one would thrust forward his torso while the other’s bosom would jiggle in response. It sort of reminded me of the roller skating rinks where all the social kids went when I was young. The one person who came up to me was another who was misplaced from the goth scene, a gal more accustomed to Manray and Haven who was also here for the first time. And just to top it all off, she knew Mandy! (And she left immediately when I mentioned her. ) 40 Everyone hanging around at Fire &amp; Water seemed hopelessly bored, so Kate from Ware and I made a list of random items to find, taking Jim with us on a scavenger hunt around town for: a paper clip, a feather, purple lights, an out of order sign, a paper bag, a padlock, a green leaf, someone named Jennifer and someone named John. We didn’t find anyone named John or Jennifer, for all we tried, but we did find everything else! 41 Robyn took me aside tonight. She added to the previously established no-promises, no-commitment, no-label nature of our relationship the clarification that she wants to be involved with other people. "

    "body": "42 I played mini concerts to myself on the streets. One woman stopped to hear, leaning against a lamppost, and between songs I glanced toward her and then nervously looked back down at my guitar, beginning to play another song. She left after that. 43 My faith in music was reaffirmed when I stopped in Fire &amp; Water and was sucked in for the entire solo set of Shara Worden, who usually plays with a band called AwRy. I poured sugar into my coffee, a rebelliously simple melody being played on an electric guitar caught my attention, and after the impressively soulful vocals kicked in I looked to the performance space. When I saw her there, alone, using a pencil like a slide along the guitar’s frets, I sat down. I went to buy a CD and got caught up in conversation with her. She sat down and we talked about music production, sparseness, Bjork, and songwriting. I told her to start a revolution of vulnerability and to get famous because I said so. When the next act began their performance I told her I should go, and so I went back to the park where I had left my guitar with the people hanging out there. Then I went with Tina and Kestrel to see Moulin Rouge for the first time, at Mount Holyoke College. 44 Marie called me up and requested that I join her for dinner at Friendly’s in Enfield, Connecticut. Wearing the most serious of faces, in casual conversational voices we discussed how, to celebrate Christmas, she dresses up in a suit of food and money, visits starving children, and takes pictures to send to Santa Claus; how Nostradamus predicted the upcoming takeover of the planet by the Mongoose Liberation Front; and the connection these mongoose forces have to Osama bin Laden. How very confused the woman behind us looked. Too bad she didn’t stick around to hear our singing. From there I went to Northampton. I found Jonny, and we ran into a guy he used to work with, and the guy he used to work with tipped us off to the fact that Sonic Youth and J. Mascis were playing a secret show at the Flywheel. We went there in time to catch the last half hour or so of Sonic Youth’s set, cramped in there with a crowd of about a hundred people. Jonny stayed inside when I left, presumably wanting to try to chat with the musicians. Much to my surprise, while walking to my car I ran into Marie and her boy, who had been hanging out at the new coffee shop there in Easthampton because they were chummy with the owners. Marie’s boy said that he had to sleep but suggested that I keep Marie company. So, Marie and I drove in our separate cars to the Whately Diner. Upon stepping out I saw some of the meteor shower I had heard was going to occur. Pretty! When Marie arrived, singing continued. The two of us sang Patsy Cline, and I also performed my soulful rendition of Ernie from Sesame Street’s “Rubber Ducky”. We had our classic serious talks about deep emotions and the nature of time and space and permutation, and she didn’t know it but I almost teared up when she started saying sweet things about me. Some friends of hers whose names I never caught sat down with us, and another guy I, and presumably they, kinda knew let us look through his books of The Onion. Then I came home and recorded a weird song of synth and manipulated vocals called “Beyond Leo”. 45 A gothic function at Tina’s place. Early Thanksgiving celebration, turkey and apple pie and more caffeine than you can shake the hands you’re trying to hold still at. A show and tell of deadly martial arts weapons. Hot cider from the stove. Fuller wearing his shirt as pants and pants as shirt and sitting upside-down. The Fifth Element. Then to Robyn’s. Feeling autumn on the outside porch. Forgetting time for most of the Tori Amos album Under the Pink. Lying still. 46 Strangers seem more supportive to me than family, so it was kinda neat that for Thanksgiving I was with people I didn’t really know. Tina’s co-worker from Subway in Amherst, Alicia, and her friends from Cleveland, Anne and Rachel. I went over at something like 1 in the morning. They were there with a guy who’d given them a ride from the Hampshire Mall because they’d gotten stranded. As requested I brought over my keyboard, plus a guitar. The guy was a musician and persuaded Anne to play along with him. After he left we went to Denny’s in Enfield and then came back and I slept on the couch and woke up and sat around and a Thanksgiving salad was being prepared but I wanted to come home and appreciate the empty house, clean some, work on music. But my mother was home, not having gone anywhere because she said that she hadn’t been able to find the right outfit. 47 Maurice IMed me. In town for Thanksgiving, he proposed that we get coffee. I agreed and he gave me directions to his house in Springfield. After signing off I became frantic in a search for my glasses and forgot about the directions. I turned off the computer. I drove in what I thought was the general direction, based on landmarks that I thought I remembered. My intuition must have been quite in tune at the time, because I thought, “I should start checking street signs,” and the first one I saw was his street’s. I didn’t know the house number, either, so I just guessed and his name on the mailbox confirmed that I had guessed correctly. Once I entered the house I had to climb three flights of stairs in near-total darkness to get to the door of his actual living space. I thanked him for not having turned on the light to the stairs, since it had made for even more adventure. We got coffee in Enfield and chatted about many things. On the way back we decided that 2 AM was in fact a good time to grab some equipment from my house and then to play music in his attic. It was a great experience. 48 There was a jam session last night formulated by Jonny, with me, Jim, and Madeira. It was strange. Really loud noise with no structure or coherence. The three of them on guitars and me with two keyboards. I felt disconnected through it, like what I played wasn’t really mattering. It seemed that Madeira felt the same way: after a point he was just staring into space, playing Devo riffs or finger-picking “Blackbird”. 49 I went to Boston with Jonny to see a band that his friend was playing in. It was in a little lounge downstairs from where the Blue Man Group does shows. Blue men would walk through at random intervals, which I found agreeable. 50 People brace for the first snow of the year. The stores are filled by holiday shoppers on a Saturday night. I browse shelves full of items that no longer register to me as things that people buy, only as things that I can poke at. Sarah N. appears. She says, “Come on” and I follow her into CVS, where she is buying candy for someone in her house at Smith College, where she’s now studying. She asks me about myself. I could be doing so much more with myself, the questions seem to imply. We step outside and there it begins—the first snow. “You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to,” she says after I’ve followed her into Faces. I leave, feeling like I’m serving no purpose. But the snow is nice. 51 Capo’s in Easthampton. I get up to the microphone and half-heartedly read something old. Outside I call Robyn from Marie’s cell phone. She’s stressed out and working on a paper for class still, but she says she’ll come there to read a poem. She arrives late, after the place has closed, as I stand outside. Our initial conversation is along these lines: “They’re closed,” I say. “I know,” she says. “I’d like to hear your poetry, though. ” “I left it at home. ” “I thought you wanted to read. ” “Yeah, I changed my mind. ” “Well, should we go and do something?” “No. I’m sorry. ” “You just came here, and now you just want to go home?” “Yeah. ” Once she’s certain that no one’s around, we kiss a little—those sparse, delicate kisses of hers. All kisses from her feel like rushed, “I’m late for work, mmm, mmm, gotta go” kisses. “I was excited,” she says, “I got two phone messages from you in two days. ” “Well, yeah,” I say, “But I don’t want you to think I’m smothering you. I don’t want you to think I’m being puppydoggish. ” She just laughs. After we say our goodbyes, I cross the street, toward my car. “Call me!” she yells across the street. “Call me!” I yell in return. She either says nothing or says something I can’t hear. “I will!” I add. 52 Alicia and I sit at the Village Commons and play with string for a half hour. 53 Good moments with Alicia tonight. Killing time in Amherst after she was finished work at Subway, she asks, “Do you want me to show you my daily routine for when I work in the morning?” I say yes, so she points out where the bus drops her off. We walk down a little alleyway to where she likes to stand and watch construction. Then around, by some stores toward Subway, past Subway, to the bookstore where she looks at books before starting her shift. Then, once I tell her about my little self-esteem issues after performing, she says she’ll feel bad if she just goes home when I’m still feeling down. So again we sit outside at the Village Commons and talk. 54 “I meant what I said the other night, you know—that I wanted to make sure you didn’t think I was being puppydoggish. ” “I don’t think that,” Robyn says. “Okay. ” “(Pause) Are you in love with me?” “(Pause) No. I do have a love for you. But when I think of ‘in love’ I think of… something that couldn’t be undone without it having a huge impact on everything. And I haven’t had any reason to make an idea of what could be with you. (Pause) Are you in love with me?” “No. Not yet. ” 55 Chris. Cousin. Twenty-one years old. He exits his car screaming the words to an AC/DC song. Ken. Cousin. Chris’s twin brother. He exits the house. We talk about drugs. “So do you have a girl in your life? Or a guy?” I’m asked. “(Mumble mumble),” I respond. “No?” “(Mumble mumble). ” “No one really worth your time, though, huh?” “(Mumble mumble. )” “(Laughter). ” Katie. Cousin. Eleven years old. “She’s always copying me,” she tells me, about a neighborhood girl who had just come by to say hello. “Well,” I say, “It happens. Everyone picks things up from everyone else, anyway. ” “But she’s always copying me. I hate her. ” “No, don’t do that. ” “I do. I hate her. ” The next time I see her, a few minutes later, she’s crying, looking at a picture of our aunt’s dog who died not too long ago. Kelli. Cousin. Seventeen years old. “What are you reading?” she asks. I show her. “What’s that word?” “‘Hideous’. ” “Oh, okay. I can’t read. Hm. Weird. ” I shrug. “I didn’t know you smoked,” she says. “Yup,” I reply. “How long have you been smoking?” “Since I was, like, seventeen. ” “Really? Oh, wow. Where have I been? No, wait a minute. Where have you been? The last time I saw you was in Greenfield, you were with that really pretty French girl. ” “Oh, yeah, Brielle. Wow. That was, like, a year and a half ago. Well. I’ve been… a lot of places. ” “That’s good—travel. I wish I could do that. ” “Well. You could. ” I forget her name. My Uncle Bill’s girlfriend. In her 30’s. She comes outside for a cigarette. “So where’s your girlfriend?” “Um. ” “Or you don’t have one?” “No, I don’t. ” “You do?” “No. No, I don’t. ” “Oh. I thought you were seeing someone, some girl. ” “Um… maybe. ” “Or maybe that was before you left town. ” Brenda. Aunt. In her forties. She walks through the driveway, singing a song whose words are something like, “I didn’t want to fuck you, but you made me do it anyway. ” She then draws attention to the size of her gut, and comparisons of gut size with other family members follow. 56 On a quest so that Fuzzy (who is visiting Alicia from Alabama) can see snow for the first time. We drive to Vermont and back, through the unfamiliar Berkshires at night. It’s snowing a little when we stop for gas, then we stop in North Adams to slide around on ice and to let her play with what’s on the ground. We thought about driving to Buffalo, where they’re famously buried in the stuff, but I was already overtired when we started the trip. 57 Robyn and I watch a videocassette about the fabled Bigfoot and Yeti. She tells me she has been feeling disconnected from her intimate relationships. I, too, have been feeling disconnected… from most things. 58 I would proudly wear any vibrant colors you gave me. 59 New Year’s Eve, went back to the house, then found Chicopee Lori online, hung out at her place, then rushed back to Noho for the actual turning, which was not even greeted by a countdown, just fireworks and a rising ball. Was hard to tell when the new year actually began. While I was waiting for it to happen, it happened. "

    "body": "60 New Year’s Day, 2002. Helping Tina move into her new room. Hanging Christmas lights on January 1, watching something like nine consecutive episodes of Whose Line Is It Anyway? 61 I pick up Alice, and from Springfield we get as far north as Holyoke on I-91 before suddenly the scary whirry shrieky noise I’d started hearing a day or two before and acknowledged and mentioned in passing to Bruce, it starts going but quite intensely and here I am in the third lane away from the shoulder, passing a tractor-trailer, then it starts smoking and the steering is not functioning properly, but I manage to pull over, and a cop comes up just before I’m about to use Alice’s cell phone, and he says I’m pulled over in a bad place and he uses the word “expedite” and the rest of the sentence doesn’t really matter so I say I’ll try to make it to the exit just a little up the way and I do and I turn the wheel hard hard harder to turn onto the first side street I come across. I call Bruce, who comes, gets a part from the auto parts store, tries to replace the broken serpentine belt (I like the name) but fails and Alice and I listen to Queen happily (“I want to ride my bicycle, I want to ride my bike…” which becomes my theme song to her) and finally I’m told to take off with Bruce’s vehicle, so we still go to Northampton for coffee as we’d intended. She’s never been to the Haymarket Café before. I’m surprised. She gets food and likes it. I get coffee and like it. 62 Wanting to record tonight’s performance of Maurice and Marie’s band, The Basement, with my Christmas gift portable Sony minidisc player slash recorder, I’m notified that Chicopee now has a Radio Shack and I go in there and the guy tells me that I shouldn’t be having the problems I’m having and that my equipment should work just fine. Makes me think of what my mom said, “Nothing ever works for you,” meaning tools and technology and whatever, and I just said to her that it’s okay the minidisc player mysteriously stopped working in the car, since the car is broken now too so it’s not an issue. Then I went to the one bookstore in Chicopee whose existence I am aware of, which I used to walk to from the old house where we lived, called simply The Bookstore, and I was initially drawn into it because looking inside the window I didn’t see any books. Apparently The Bookstore doesn’t make much money selling books in Chicopee, so the displays in the front are mostly stationery and knick-knacks, and the books that they have are mostly used, garage sale fare, bad romance novels and multiple editions of Stephen King and Dean Koontz thrillers and there’s one rack labeled “Literature” with those $1-$2 copies of thin volumes from the public domain. But they still have a decent magazine section. My dad didn’t like for me to go in this store when I was little, because they also sell “adult” magazines on the top shelf. 63 Robyn asked if she could call me her “lover” and my mind still flashed back to a few weeks prior and her emphasizing, “I feel like… being with a lot of people right now. ” She has really been confusing me. 64 Received a letter today saying that I have been dismissed again from Holyoke Community College for my poor academic performance. If you’re not good enough for community college, where do you go? 65 Alicia is moving back to Cleveland. 66 Once again I was the only person at Capo’s in Easthampton to show up for the open mic. I basically performed a full set to a crowd of three people, two of them employees. The set list was something like: Flight of the Angel, I Melt, No Standing Appraising Light, Skin, My Favorite Color is You, Extinguish to Vapor, So Frolic the Immortals, Stardrift, Pieces. 67 A room. Me, Mick, Tina, Charlie, Harvey, and a Game Cube. Doing the research, I realize that it was three days late from being the one-year anniversary of the day Charlie, Harvey and I all met each other. Once in a while someone asks, “Where did you meet __?” and I laugh because it doesn’t really matter anymore. My view of the Valley went from really big to really small, really, really quickly. 68 Haven, the long-lived goth night, which died out after a short stay at Pearl Street, has been resurrected in the space where it originally lived. Previously the Club Metro, the space is now a gay club called Diva’s. The now-working sinks are quite popular. 69 Haven. Walk in door, show I. D. , pay, hello to Augusta, who says she’s been hanging out with Spikey Hat Bill, anytime someone mentions Bill I ask who it is and they say, “Spikey Hat” and I say okay. Can’t think of any other Bills I know in the area offhand but I feel like there should be a lot of them. Look at the dance floor and kind of smile appreciatively, then up the stairs looking to grab a seat and Moon is there, we talk for a long while until Tina comes by, pokes me in the back, and I give her a hug while acknowledging that “I’m still listening to what you’re saying” to Moon but she stops what she’s saying to ask for an introduction and I’m surprised that she doesn’t know who Tina is and I expect to say “Tina” and for her to say “oh, right, of course!” but instead she asks after Tina’s left if that’s my girl and I say no. A hello and brief exchange with Jay Barnes about the niceness of being back in the old club space. For about the span of a song, watching the dancers. Noticing Sarah H. and then that she’s dancing with someone, and I look and say to myself, “Is that… Liv?” and it is so I follow them once they’re off the floor. “It’s been a gazillion years since I’ve seen you,” says Liv. We talk a little, then stop talking and she communicates nonverbally, so we just look at each other a bit and she says, “Just like the old days. When we would transcend reality. ” I acknowledge this. She smirks and says, “You love me. ” Liz comes around to us (me, Liv, Sarah N. and Mole), then all of them leave the club. I walk around and find Charley, Harvey and Spooky in the little lounge area that now has televisions quietly playing movies (tonight, Rosemary’s Baby). Charley is playing Tetris on an old school black and white Game Boy. When Spooky takes off I sit next to him. Then Tina comes and motions for me to squish over, and sits half on me, half on the arm of the loveseat. She’s very quiet compared to the Tina I’m used to. So Charlie’s playing Tetris, I’m watching Rosemary’s Baby although I can’t hear the sound, and Tina is mostly just staring into space. 70 I saw Robyn. Went to the diner. Got pulled over by a police officer for made up reasons. He didn’t push the matter of the tail light that was supposedly out, just looked in and around the car for a good long time. Back to Robyn’s for lying in bed and talking. 71 The phone rings. It’s Robyn, in a good mood. “Would you like to finish that movie, and maybe watch the other one, too?” she asks. We had to stop the movie last night, because she was having flashbacks. “Sure,” I say, and I head over. 72 Tina IMs. She wants to arrange a trip to Club Hell in Providence. I agree to drive if the cost of gas and admission is covered for me. She says this isn’t a problem. I pick her up. Phil has changed his mind and isn’t coming. We head to UMASS, where Tina has arranged for us to meet someone named Adam. We’re late, so he’s not at the designated rendezvous point. I suggest that we drop by Charlie’s house to invite him along. We do. We watch his cat and her newborn kittens. (In the bathroom, they’re in a box, Tina is in ripped fishnets. We sit around to take in the cuteness. Charlie’s still downstairs. ) The Mapquest directions serve us poorly, but in spite of confusion we find our way haphazardly to the club. At one point I approach some people because I need a light for my cigarette. One gal happens to be using a lighter, keeping it lit and watching it. I move in and light my cigarette from this flame. She gives me a disapproving look. 73 I had wished Robyn a happy Valentine’s Day in my telephone message, but she hadn’t made any mention of the holiday other than to say that many “develop dangerous expectations” for Feb. 14 “when it’s just another day”. On the floor as she popped in the film of her choice. My objection that it was going to overwhelm me fell on deaf ears. I tried to lie next to her and she moved away without saying anything. (Although we weren’t speaking, she could see that I was now getting progressively more tense. She said something along the lines of, “I don’t have the capacity to make you feel better right now. ” So I left, trying to be respectful about it, saying, “See you tomorrow, maybe?” and she said, “Yeah. ”) 74 I worked for Field Marketing, Inc. , which worked for Abt Associates. An office building in Hadley. ‘Everybody’ worked there at one point or another as a telephone interviewer. A computer told you which number to call. You called. You attempted to get the person on the other end of the line to complete a survey. Usually they hung up. If they didn’t, you recorded your answers. Each call you made, successful or not, was tallied on a sheet. The project on which I worked recorded information from recipients of Medicare/Medicaid—meaning, a certain class of elderly people—nationwide. The job provided free coffee, with powdered non-dairy creamer. An employee could create their own schedule every week. There was no dress code. Cigarette smokers were told to move to the side of the building, rather than the front of it. 75 Someone walking by plays with my hair for about ten seconds and then leaves. I don’t know who it is. I never bother to check. 76 In my hometown, and my interactions: “Hey, sexy,” says a mocking male voice as I enter the 7-11. I don’t look in his direction. The guy who works the night shift at 7-11. “Hey, I haven’t seen you in… like a month. ” As I pour my coffee I say, “Yeah, I haven’t been going for walks so much as I used to. ” And on the way back, I think it’s the same group of kids who’d taunted me before, still driving around, because what else would they do, after all. One’s hanging out the window, I’m almost flattered at the effort that’s put into his projection of, “Have fun being gay, fucker!” 77 I needed an adventure. Graff invited me along for a trip out to Hell Night at Manray in Cambridge. For some reason I was under the impression that we were going to pick up someone else, but it ended up just being me and Graff and (guy) Kim who went. Then we drove. At a rest stop I shared Good and Plentys. In Cambridge we attempted to park in a parking garage only to drive through something like ten levels with no empty spaces. I ended up parking in the same area far down Mass. Ave. where I parked the last time I drove to Central Square (to meet Maurice). In line, Graff and I were hassled for our attire—Graff for his glow-in-the-dark shoelaces and me for wearing a red shirt. (“It’s got to be all black,” I was told. ) But Graff was persistent and I just buttoned up my black overshirt, so we got in. I got to chill with Bluejay and Xta and Mick (whose whereabouts I’m never certain about these days, although I’m never at all shocked to see him wherever I happen to run into him). My usually successful method of exiting the Boston area (drive in a random direction until I see a sign for a familiar highway) didn’t serve us all that well this time, so we went out of our way quite a bit. We ended up taking 2 West to 495 South to 20 West before finally catching the turnpike in Worcester. One benefit of this was that a conversation (well, mostly a rant of Graff’s) about the corruption of nature was punctuated by a sign that pointed the way to Walden Pond. The night began to get foggier and foggier. It was late enough that there were almost no other cars on the road; but even so, the lack of visibility was disconcerting. We didn’t know what town we were in or what time it was when we finally saw a convenience store through the fog. We ate, drank Dunkin Donuts coffee, and received weird looks from the other people who were in there. 78 Just after dawn, I’m the only person in sight. Forest Park, Springfield, Massachusetts. The trees still shake off droplets of the previous day’s rain. Geese are hanging out, a couple of antisocial ones are doing their goose-like things several feet away. Most of the others are at another part of the stream. One keeps watching me, curious and alert. 79 It’s just about the beginning of Spring, this palindromic year of 2002. I want to write a story with a happy ending, I think to myself as I drive north. I try to convince myself that I have enough gas in the car to make it back home tonight. I don’t. The cassette I’m listening to is Concrete Blonde’s Bloodletting, which appeared in my vehicle recently under mysterious circumstances. I park in front of the Diner. I step out and hear a voice call, “Levi!” from across the parking lot. It’s Harvey. He’s in a car with Charlie and a drunk girl whose name I can’t remember. They say they’re going to a place for a purpose. The important part is that they won’t be long. The drunk girl exits the vehicle to give me a hug. I help her back into the backseat after we’ve embraced. I wave goodbye. I sit at a booth with Harvey’s friend, listening to stories about their trip to Baltimore and life in hostels until Harvey and Charlie return. Harvey works on his latest comic book project, Humpy and the Murder Pigeon. Charlie stares into space most of the time, but occasionally interjects cute and/or meaningful tidbits into the conversation. Harvey’s friend is the one who pays for our beverages. I don’t have any money in my pocket, and after I start the car I realize that getting home is going to be an issue. It’s about 3:30 in the morning and I’m a forty minute drive from my house. I detour to Sunderland, to Squire Village. This is the only residence in the area where I can find acquaintances certain to be awake at this hour. The light shining through the downstairs window confirms that I’m in luck. I knock on the door.  “Come in,” I’m told. “Wow,” says Nora, “Everyone’s dropping by tonight. Charlie and Harvey were here earlier. ” “Yeah,” I say, “I was just at the diner with them. But then I realized that I didn’t have enough gas to get back home. ” “Ah,” she replies, “Well, I only have a dollar myself, that I’m saving for the bus fare to get back from my parents’ house when I go visit. ” “Is there anyone else I might be able to borrow a couple dollars from?” I ask. “I don’t think Annie is still up, but Tina is. She’s waiting for someone. ” I have a fear of intruding on people at inopportune moments, so I somehow rationalize that the polite thing to do is to eavesdrop on what Tina is doing before I knock on her door. She lets me in and stays on the phone, laughing and smiling. I sit on the floor while she gives the person directions to Sunderland. I flip through a Francesca Lia Block novel that she has checked out of the library. I recognize the excitement in her voice. When she gets off the phone I tell her why I’m there. She says that she can’t help, that she doesn’t have any money to lend. She cleans her room in a frenzy, clearing out ashtrays and spraying Febreeze on the pillows. I head back downstairs. She follows. She, Nora, and I chat while awaiting the arrival of Tina’s new love interest. I’m painting my fingernails black when he arrives. It’s about 5 AM. I don’t get the chance to ask him if he can spare a couple of dollars before Tina leads him upstairs. Once the two of them have been out of sight for a while, Nora finally says, “Here. I think I have an extra dollar in change that I can give you. ” I thank her and successfully make my way home as the sun rises. My mother is awake when I return. I stumble around the kitchen as I often do, like a rat, eating small bits of easily-prepared food and candies that sit on the table. “I don’t understand you,” she says, “You’re too complicated for me. ” Uncharacteristically, I sit with her for awhile, and we converse. I lie to her, saying that I work tonight, because I don’t want to admit that oversleeping has cost me my job. I hope to stay awake for the entirety of the day so as to reclaim a decent sleeping schedule. I fail at this. My mother attempts to wake me up at several points during the afternoon because she believes that I need to get to work. I mumble excuses to her. This is a sad feeling. 80 I awaken around 10 PM. It’s Monday night. No one able and willing to keep me company is online, so I set out to wander. I drive to the diner again. Rikki, a ubiquitous Hippie type, greets me there. She bums a cigarette and says that she’s leaving in two days for New Mexico and Arizona. I tell her that in three days I’m leaving for my own trip that will take me through New Mexico and Arizona and ultimately to Los Angeles. I sit at the counter for a while with a coffee and Coke, scribbling into my journal, before Nora happens to show up. She and I take the opportunity to scope out road maps and discuss plans. She’s very organized. 81 A call to Robyn and I’ve obtained an invitation to her place. Since the start of her college semester I’ve been seeing her an average of once every week or two. Suffice it to say that sometimes, she feels like she’s in love with me, but I feel like I should be prepared for her to disappear at any time. "

    "body": "82 I make my appearance at Capo’s Coffee Café with acoustic guitar in hand. It’s just me and another songwriter I knew from the more prominent Fire &amp; Water open stage night. It’s just the two of us, although a couple more performers wander in later on. The nature of the night is such that I play two brief sets of three songs each, and after the second I’m given high praise by an odd man who appears in his forties. “I can tell you’re a real artist,” he says. Then, as though letting me in on superb secrets, he explains to me the “Masters’ Style of the Masters”—how to impress an audience, and the more nebulous “Special Style”, which has to do with focusing chi. Eric, one of the owners of the café, congratulates me more simply, by saying that he’ll suggest to the guy who does booking that I should play a gig there sometime. 83 The day before I leave, I head up to Northampton. I chat for a bit with Salma when I run into her. 84 The drive to New York City features Nora behind the wheel, Sarah from Smith in the passenger’s seat, and me in the back with a pillow and comforter, lying back, asking Sarah questions about this and that, listening to her speak. I’m sleepy at this point, and a little confused overall, but the talk is fun. Nora does not allow smoking in her car, I find. Navigational dilemmas at first lead us into New Jersey instead of into Manhattan, but we eventually make it to the apartment. This is my first time in a New York City without the World Trade Center. This is the home of Sarah from Smith’s mother and stepfather, an apartment with a doorman in Manhattan. Sarah’s room is fairly spacious, with its own bathroom. Science fiction novels decorate the bookshelves. Nora and I meet her stepfather briefly. He seems a quiet man. Sarah stretches, in her pajamas, for the benefit of her troublesome back while I, online, attempt to coordinate my scheduled rendezvous with Connecticut Sarah. Nora moves in on Sarah with a request for cuddles. This is the one aspect of Nora’s personality I am most wary of in the context of this trip: although I believe physical affection should be celebrated, she seems really aggressive with wanting to cuddle with people sometimes. I sit outside, watching the gray-blue of the Manhattan sky. I smoke my dirty cigarettes alone until the streets and the polluted air have absorbed the waste of my pitiful nature and I in turn have consumed a piece of their rhythm. I drift off into sleep for about two hours, on Sarah’s bed next to Nora while Sarah lies on a floor mattress. (Glasses placed on the end table, covered by blankets so that only her long, light hair is visible. ) My mind decides to do its job this time, rousing me to half-awake, peek-at-the-clock mode until I exit quietly around 7:45 AM It’s subway time—the 2 to Times Square, the shuttle to Grand Central Station, the 6 to Astor Place. Having heard murmurs of yet another imminent hike in cigarette tax for this city, I convince myself that the $5. 40 I pay for a pack of cigarettes should be considered a deal. I reach the Starbucks that is our appointed meeting place around 9:30 (our scheduled rendezvous time). I buy my favorite coffee drink, a foamed mint mocha (or a mint mochaccino, or just a complex series of instructions, depending on where I order it. ) Connecticut Sarah recognizes me immediately. At the time, I’m preparing to go outside for a cigarette, since she’s a little bit late. She and her friend Jess say hello. They get their own beverages, then we go outside and begin to walk. Jess seems a motherly type, with an occasionally biting sense of humor. The shirt she wears is kinda poofy. Sarah is friendly, confident in her demeanor, wise for someone who seems to be kept on a fairly tight leash by her parents. (She’s eighteen. ) The three of us simply wander around and chat, poke around at a little flea market event, wander down St. Mark’s. I get a coffee to go at Esperanto. We eat at an Ethiopian restaurant. Conversation continues. Jess needs to leave to attend a wedding or somesuch. The words float about in my mind before I bring myself to make the request, but finally I tell Sarah that I would like to go to “Ground Zero”, the site of the collapsed Twin Towers. The signs that we are nearing our destination are the booths on the sidewalks, covered with photos of the buildings before and after. Small blockades in the roads for underground workers. Crowds. The designated walkway. The closed street, and in the blink of an eye, the nearby buildings with pieces missing. The park nearby has headstones for the deceased. Disposable cameras taking photos, auto-recharging flashes in the daylight. Most of the site’s remains are obscured by trailers and such. Connecticut Sarah and I say our goodbyes at the subway station. I return to Sarah from Smith’s neighborhood. 85 Nora and I gather our things and depart for Cleveland. After we’ve placed ourselves sufficiently outside of the NY metropolitan area, we hit a diner in New Jersey. “Smoking or non?” asks the waitress. “Non,” says Nora. “Smoking!” I exclaim. I wait for her to argue at me, but she just gives me a look. So, I pretend she is saying “Non!” every time I say “Smoking!” and continue to exclaim “Smoking!” every second beat. I win, and tell her I just won’t smoke while she’s eating. As we return to the car after eating, I realize that I’ve left all but a few of my CDs in New York at Sarah’s. Pennsylvania keeps us occupied by its nothingness for a while. I take over driving halfway through the state, taking us until partway into Ohio. We call Alicia once we’re in Cleveland, to get the specifics of finding her house. (Cleveland is where she’s originally from, although she has done more than her share of wandering for a seventeen-year-old. ) When we arrive she gives us a tour of her house. It’s similar in feeling to her uncle’s place where she stayed while she was in Massachusetts, having miscellaneous interesting things scattered about. Alicia suggests that we go to the Phoenix coffeehouse. I agree. We drive there. A crowd exits as we arrive. It includes Rachel (Alicia’s friend whom I’d met when she’d visited Massachusetts) and Rachel’s sister Roxanne, who is also a LiveJournal friend of mine. They both give me hugs in the exuberant way that they like to. We head inside. Their crowd of friends is active and the conversation is fast-paced. I sip coffee while the dynamics of the group’s interaction shift drastically from one moment to the next. At the end of our stay there, Nora and I are invited in on their ceremonial goodbye huddle: 1, 2, 3… I love you!” I call this beautiful. Nora calls it weird. The scenery of Alicia’s world in Cleveland is close to how I imagined it, although I’m not sure how I imagined it being this way. It’s a comfortable place for me, in fact very similar to many Massachusetts cities. Nora falls asleep. “Do you ever go for walks around here?” I ask Alicia. “Yes, sometimes,” she says. “Do you want to now?” “You’re not tired?” “Nah. ” I’ve very much lacked sleep so far in this trip, but I’ve also felt fairly unaffected by this. It’s a colder night than either of us are prepared for, but we persist. Walking her street in in the middle of the night, after passing the residence of Roxanne and Rachel, Alicia asks me, “Are you going to survive?” “Yes. ” I say. Then I pause, and ask her in turn, “Am I going to survive?” “Yes,” she responds. She takes me to a bridge over the highway, where we watch cars approach and then zoom under us. “This was our destination,” she says. Then, “Let’s go back this way,” toward train tracks. I feel an impulse to walk in another direction, so lead us there until we reach a curious business—World of Sleep, a mattress store, with signs that read “going out of business” and “final days”. I smile and frolic. She leads us back to her house. In the morning, Alicia’s father cooks us eggs. The three of us huddle again as a goodbye. I tell Alicia, who will soon be moving to Mobile, Alabama, that she should always stay in touch and look me up if her travels ever again lead her in my direction. She’s on my mental list of people I’m happy to know exist, no matter how often or rarely I might see them. 86 We head south in the direction of Columbus. The family of an old friend to Nora’s father lives here, so we look them up. The folks we meet are another Alicia, who’s around our age, plus her teenage sister and their mother. Inside their nice home we sit for an hour or so. Nora fills them in on her family. Talk about career and college comes about and I begin to get defensive. I’m wary of needing to answer “What are you doing with your life?” questions from well-to-dos. I’m put more at ease once the girl our age starts saying that she’s enrolled in community college, having attended and then left two different universities. 87 A fast food stop, my first phone call home to my mom, and we’re on the highway again. We cross Indiana and head a good part of the way through Illinois before stopping at a Day’s Inn in Vandalia. Awakening from a dream in the middle of the night, I see moving images in the bed. I sit up. I see myself with someone else. A shadow walks behind me in this vision, places their hand on my head. I watch myself affected by this touch, as though some sort of energy has been given to me. I watch a white light increase its intensity in front of me. This is some late night weirdness. This isn’t magic. It’s no message from the future. More like the memory of a video game. I lie back down and return to sleep. 88 In the morning a quick drive west takes us into St. Louis. Nora tells me that her mother has been through this city three times, each of these times failing to get to the top of the famous six-hundred-forty-foot-tall “Gateway to the West” arch. She wishes to fulfill this family quest. I, on the other hand, don’t feel like spending the $8 it will take, figure that I’ve been at high elevations before, so instead wander the downtown and get a coffee from Starbucks. Before this, though, I wander the “Museum of Westward Expansion” that’s at the archway. It’s… absurd. A trip through the general nothingness of highway driving in Missouri leads us to our destination, the town of Columbia. Nora and I are surprised and impressed to find that this college town is in fact kind of fun. We’re here to see They Might Be Giants play a concert before we embark on the most ambitious segment of our driving, a fourteen-hour stretch into Texas. Once our concert tickets have been bought, we wander the downtown a bit. Then we wait in line. We meet some folks, including one girl named Tessie. The singer for the opening act hands us all bumper stickers for his band. “Are you any good?” I ask, since none of us have ever heard of OK Go. “We’re amazing,” he tells us. After the show, Nora and I exchange contact info with Tessie and the others. We show off the car we’re driving, which by now is a mess of blankets and non-perishable food items. Our drive south takes us on stormy state highways. Through the rain, Nora attempts to drive in spite of her sleepiness. Before we’re out of Missouri, she’s fallen asleep. According to plans, we’ll be driving until the following afternoon. The two of us trade places driving and sleeping. Then, this is the one leg of the journey when I drive significantly more than Nora does. The speed limit is 70, although I can’t always take advantage of this through the weather conditions. At about 1 AM, just before crossing into Oklahoma, I detour about a quarter mile off the highway so that we can go to Kansas, leave, and say that we’ve been there. Oklahoma follows. We search for a rest stop that will meet our needs of a restroom and a place to buy gas. At this time of night, it takes us about fifty miles. I find myself driving through rush hour traffic in Oklahoma City while Nora sleeps. For a while I worry I might have lost track of the direction I need to travel in order to meet I-40, but in the end all is well. The rest of the state is fairly empty. Just after crossing the Texas border, I turn the wheel over to Nora. She takes us into Lubbock. 89 Lubbock is a minor city. It has no obvious suburbs but instead is just a populated area in the middle of nowhere. We find our way to Christin’s apartment. She’s Nora’s online friend, a student at Texas Tech. She apologizes ceaselessly for the condition of the apartment (which is, in fact, very clean), for the lack of television channels she can provide (which is a digital service) and for the speed of her computer (which is certainly sufficient). I go back and forth on how she makes me feel, but the sign reading, “If at first you don’t succeed, do it like your mother told you” that leans up against her coffee table’s lamp seems to express a lot of it. Her friend Christina stops by and sticks with us for awhile. Television appears to be a central part of the interactions these people take part in, such that Nora and I are told countless times, “You can watch whatever you want. ” We go to a steakhouse and eat there, eating from the big container of peanuts that they leave for us and throwing the shells on the floor. After a brief conversation that Nora and I have, Christina says, “Y’all’re too intellectual for us. ” 90 The trip to Albuquerque is intimidating to Nora, who is used to getting a lot of sleep. I’m fully awake, however, so I take over much of the driving responsibilities. We stop briefly at what claims to be the burial site of Billy the Kid. As we approach Albuquerque it’s all I can do not to veer off the road as my eye wanders, watching the scenery. We reach our designated meeting spot, the Frontier Restaurant, about twenty minutes late. We wait around for some time, but Jasmine does not show. Calls to her house tell us that she is not home, so we wait. Nora grows impatient and suggests moving on to Tempe. “Let’s give her a chance,” I say. Nora goes to search for a supermarket while I wait at the Frontier. Jasmine is someone I’ve known via the Internet for about six years but whom I haven’t met before today. What I remember about her is a quiet nature that she had communicated in the telephone conversations we had had. She arrives. We chat for a bit. She’s pleasant and actually asks for me to browse through her bookbag. Funny! Usually, I’m the one asking if I can do that. Arthur meets up with us soon after. There’s never any confirmation made about exactly who he is, but he’s friendly. When Nora returns she’s in a bad mood, because, she says, having to wait for Jasmine broke the momentum of our trip. As time passes she lightens up, though. We wander through some stores in the downtown area and go to a Japanese restaurant with sushi boats. Walking from the sushi place I turn to Jasmine. “You’re not shy!” I accuse. “Well, I would be if you’d turned out to be a creep,” she says. I hadn’t realized that this was her first time meeting someone by way of the Internet. We head to a local coffee shop for an open mic night. It’s too late for me to sign up, so we only stay for a bit. We spend the night at Jasmine’s place. In the morning we speak with Jasmine’s mother, who invites us back anytime. Then we get back in the car and drive past sand dunes. In Arizona we stop at a tourist stop on a Navajo reservation to hang out with bison and look at Native crafts. 91 I met Syrma back in Massachusetts, the first time I went to Necrology, the all-ages goth night. Little did I suspect that night that, as time passed, I would find myself getting to know most of the kids I met there as they grew older and stayed in the scene. She meets us at the car with enthusiastic hugs—she’s one of the more affectionate people I know—and then she brings us to her dorm before leaving for her afternoon class. While she’s gone I wander a bit and get a coffee at Caffé Boa. Syrma gives us a tour of the downtown area. At an underground shop for piercings, gothy knick-knacks and that sort of thing we happen across Syrma’s friend Osiris. He comes along with us as we explore. “Do you bring people to the other side, being Osiris and all?” I ask him. “No, that’s Anubis’s job,” he replies, “Osiris just rules the underworld. ” Ah, that’s right. I’m always bad at remembering hierarchies. On the bench with Osiris at one point, I notice that he’s whistling a tune. It makes me a minute to place it, and when I finally do, I nod in understanding. “The scarecrow,” I say, looking at a group of drunk guys that has just passed us. “If I only had a brain,” he says. Syrma, Nora and I dine at a restaurant which serves both as a sports bar and as a spot for poetry readings. Nora says more about maybe moving out of Massachusetts in the near future. Everywhere we’ve gone she’s expressed an interest in moving to. It’s funny. People expected for me to want to stay in some of the places we’re visiting. Instead, she’s the one playing that role. As Syrma shows us around the artsy campus of ASU—at which, due to the climate, windows and walls often appear to be optional—I make an effort to keep my mind a blank. I intentionally make myself numb, waiting for an opportunity to isolate myself and write. After we return to Syrma’s dorm I go for a walk to buy cigarettes. The man at the convenience store asks me why I’m wearing nail polish, which I think is an odd question. Syrma sets up a makeshift bed for me, with the supportive cushion of her bed and a mattress and miscellaneous articles of clothing as a pillow. We talk while she uses the computer. Nora starts snoring as she sleeps in her bed. Syrma says she’ll join me on the floor. We curl up together to sleep. Her cuddles are amazing. The drive to Los Angeles in the morning teaches us that gas can be very expensive in the desert, but aside from that we don’t stop much. We’re zooming ahead in order not to arrive at Hermosa Beach too late. "

    "body": "92 California’s recent tourism campaign says, “Find yourself in California. ” But I’ve done that already. I headed westward into the setting sun with an intuition that served me well. I experienced firsts under their trademarked sky. What does this state have for me now? Well. Traffic, for one thing. Our schedule failed to take into consideration the fact it takes two hours to get through the L. A. area to Hermosa Beach. The highways are madness. When we finally arrive we get our name badges and head to Acapulco’s, a Mexican restaurant. I’m told that they aren’t carding for alcohol, which is understandable since most of the people gathered for the LJ Bash are above the legal drinking age of twenty-one. So I order a grande margarita—which is, in fact, quite grande, and yummy. I like margaritas. The first people I meet remind me of folks I know back east. This happens a lot—when I travel to a new location I equate the people I meet with those I’ve known before. On the walk back to the hotel, Nora asks Brad Fitzpatrick, the founder of LiveJournal, where the idea of the mascot, Frank the Goat, came from. “We needed a mascot, and said, ‘Goats are cool’, and just made him the mascot,” Brad said. “We didn’t even make the graphic; we stole it from someplace else. We’ll probably get sued for it one of these days. ” In the courtyard a big piñata of Frank the Goat is hung, and many fun toys and candy are collected by the excited congregation of journalers. After the piñata has been sufficiently ravaged I bum a cigarette from someone and stay outside in the now mostly empty courtyard. I overhear a couple of girls talking to Brad, then. They’re surprised and excited when they find out who he is. I enter the conversation for a bit, talking about myself, but one of the girls is thirty and ageist: “That’s the thing in your twenties. You think you know everything when really you haven’t lived at all,” she says, when I tell her not to judge me before she knows my story. Fooey on her. I hope I’m not so dull when I’m her age. Hotel room parties then erupt. I hang around in 310, the biggest suite, for a while. People scream and do body shots and make out with each other. I chat with two young couples who came together, who donate Southern Comfort and vodka tonics to me while I ramble on about sexuality in contemporary society and they call me a poet. I don’t know anyone at the gathering so far, except that I vaguely remember having seen a few of them naked on the Internet. I spend some time with a guy called Shaq and his gothy friends on the balcony, watching for happenings through the door as though the other partiers are in a fishbowl for our amusement. One guy is originally from North Haven, Connecticut. “North Haven?” says Shaq, who is from Philadelphia, “Ever been to The Haven?” “I have!” I say, “I actually go there regularly. ” “Yeah? It’s still there?” I fill him in on news about the club. I run across the street to buy coffee and a doughnut at Best Donuts. Things seem to be winding down when I return to the hotel, so I go to sleep. When I wake up in the morning, Nora has already been up for a bit. I sense, as I did on the previous night, that she’s sick of being around me, so I make sure not to follow her anywhere. I want to go into the city, but upon asking at the front desk about public transportation I’m told that the buses suck around here. I eat at Subway and kill time at The Coffee Bean. I go back to the room and play guitar on the balcony. When I come inside I hear Nora’s voice upstairs. She’s on the phone. “He’s kind of reticent,” she says, “And I thought, ‘Well, seven days on the road together, we’ll get to talking’, but he doesn’t talk much. Yeah. The next time I should make a little pre-road trip, if I’m going to go with someone this far. Like, make a trip to Pennsylvania before going all the way out to California with them. ” Later, as people are gathering in the lobby and preparing to leave for a place called Ein Stein’s, someone says, “Levi!” I look at her name tag, and it’s Alex, the only person I know on LiveJournal who is attending any of the bash. “Hello!” I say, and extend my arms for a hug, instinctively. The hug she gives is a weak one, and my mind suddenly gets scared and intimidated that she might, now that she’s meeting me, consider me a sketchy character. I hang around inside, nervous. For me, fear of people is often a sudden thing. If I get nervous around one person, it will take some time before I’m not afraid of anyone else. I buy a half hour’s worth of time at the pay-per-use Internet terminal in the lobby before I begin to walk to the restaurant. Ein Stein’s is nice. There’s a buffet, although to me it seems lacking. A DJ spins music not unlike what one would expect at a wedding reception. A patio is outside. I head there. Alex comes up to me again and we speak for a little longer. I chat with someone named Amy for a while, who seems to set what the theme of this night will be: standing on the sidelines, talking to people about how difficult it is to talk to people. I also get introduced to some of the crew that Alex came with. A group of us go to the beach. We walk through wide streets reserved for pedestrians, past boutiques and bars. I haven’t seen this part of Hermosa Beach yet, and it’s not bad. The tide is coming in as we stand at the beach. I attempt to make a sand castle, pushing the sands together and then patting them into a flat base before piling other pieces atop this, until I realize that, having never made a sand castle and not really visiting the beach all that often, I forget what a sand castle is supposed to look like. Mostly, the others just watch the waves awhile. Alex draws a face in the sand. As I watch her do this I come to a realization about what attracts me to art and creation. It’s not the end product, it’s not the idea of dedication or passion, it’s simply that in order to create art one must watch and truly appreciate whatever it is that they are crafting. What began as only sand was transformed under her thoughtful eye, and as she created lines with her fingers I too began to see what she imagined, what she was attempting to unveil. I thought to myself, That’s what I’ve been saying all along. That’s what I want from this life. That’s what I want from this story. Our time at the beach is over quickly. I comment that the other partiers have missed out on the real bash. Back at Ein Steins, a guy from Alabama I’d spoken to briefly the night before, approaches: “Someone was telling me you do drag?” I laugh, “No, I told her that I don’t. But I do look good in a dress. ” He goes on to speak about how he makes frequent trips to Florida to go to drag shows, how it’s just a part of him that he can’t help. “I didn’t ask for his to be who I am,” he says several times. Nora was hoping to win “LJ’er who traveled the furthest,” I know—she wrote on her nametag, “Drove from Massachusetts”—but that award goes to someone who has flown in from England. The announcer lists us as notable mentions, though. When the time is up, the lights have been restored, and the bump-and-grinding to music has ceased, it’s time to walk back to the hotel room. The walk seems longer this time, though I now had company in the same crowd I accompanied to the beach. Before going upstairs to the hotel room party we hang around on the second floor by the elevators. This is initiated when, coincidentally, we all want to buy sodas. I suggest that we all play “The Name Game”, which we do, to learn everyone’s real name and also their LiveJournal name. Our hallway crowd moves forth into room 310, which is even more crowded than it was the night before. Once again the partiers are exuberant, although now it seems that hardly anyone is doing more than watching the body shots being done at the bar of this, the hotel’s fanciest suite. I work my way to the balcony. No one’s out there. Brad Fitzpatrick is leaning on the doorway to it. “Is the balcony verboten tonight?” I ask him. “Nein,” he replies, opening the door. “Auf Weidersehen!” I smoke a cigarette and, through the night, see what I can of the Pacific Ocean. Inside, the beach/hallway crowd is still intact. “Hey, the clique is still together!” I enthuse. We, Brad, and a performance poet from Toronto seem to be pretty much the only ones not joining in on the screaming and clapping. I’ve lost track of where Nora is. Alex, Kenneth, Jessie, and Melissa go for a walk somewhere. I don’t seem to be invited, so I sit and try to converse with someone else. The others come back, and I watch as Kenneth, Jessie, the slam poet and Brad try spinning tops on the caps of soda bottles. It’s entertaining. People disappear gradually. I return to the hotel room. Nora tells me about all the new friends she made. I go to sleep, again, on the futon downstairs while she takes the suite’s upstairs bed. 93 I feel older in San Diego, through which we pass on the first leg of our return route. The sun makes time break into more moments. The coffee shop entrance is seven feet wide, incense burns, and the art is good. And there are Internet terminals and a cheerful middle-aged barista. That this should be a city seems an elaborate lie set up to fool businessmen. The coffee shop also tells me by way of a sign that if I even think of stealing, I will be cursed for life. I like what I see of this city, I do, even though this coffee shop is about all we find before hopping in the car again to continue our venture eastward. Through mountains that look like scrap heaps along the Mexican border, then into Arizona and past huge sand dunes, I hold myself back from impulses of smoking, because sitting in the limited amount of positions the car provides has been causing me to be oversensitive about my body’s inner workings. We get lost in Phoenix for a bit before finding Tempe and Arizona State University. Nora cuddles Syrma this time. In the morning, I listen to the sounds of The Young and the Restless from the television, which is under the control of Syrma’s roommate. I shower before we all head out to experience fine dining at the International House of Pancakes. The waitress is nice to us. We return to the ASU campus and Syrma leads us to an elevator. We enter. She pushes a button for a floor above us. Nothing happens. She pushes another button for a floor above us. Again, nothing happens. “This is scary,” I say, “I definitely don’t want to try riding in it, if it hasn’t worked yet. ” She’s insistent on using an elevator, though, so we try another one. This one isn’t functional either, so we walk up the outside steps to get where we’re going. “You can see a lot of Phoenix from up here,” says Syrma, “And it’s a nice sunset. ” We watch the view, then leave soon after. Our drive doesn’t last for more than a few hours before neither of us is capable of driving any longer. We’re still in Arizona when I pull the car into a Best Western parking lot. 94 In the morning we begin what will be a full day of driving. Just after nightfall in Texas Nora gets pulled over and is given a written warning for driving 74 in what is, though only at night, a 65 mile per hour zone. Soon after that, at a gas station that sells chairs made completely from parts of cattle, the attendant makes a comment about how it was a good thing they were still open. “I figured you’d want to take my money, once I started pumping,” said Nora. “Either that, or we have a shotgun,” she replied. Texas humor. By the time we’re near Norman, Oklahoma, it has gotten late. Jonanne needs to be in bed early, so over Nora’s cell phone she says in a sweet, southern voice that she’ll leave the door unlocked, pillows and blankets on the floor, and the computer plugged in and Internet ready. We step inside, and though it is dark due to the hour of night, I can make out the quality of decoration. The living room smells very nicely of potpourri. Framed photographs sit on most pieces of visible shelving. A poster for the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam hangs by the computer. Her cat watches me for most of the night while I sit at the computer and Nora sleeps on the floor. After, in the morning, I’ve finally awoken, I hear the shower running in the bathroom. I hadn’t noticed Jonanne walking through the hallway (visible from the couch) in order to get there. The sounds of a long shower follow, then hair-drying, then an electric razor, perhaps? Her cat approaches me and grants permission that I may scratch it. This trust lasts only for a number of seconds, though, before the cat wanders off again. Jonanne seems to be taking a lot of time to prepare for her day. After no distinct sound has come from the bathroom for several minutes, the whir of what may or may not be an electric razor resumes. Finally I hear the door creak open. I’m sitting on the couch. I smile at Jonanne as she carries the clothes she’s changed out of. “Just a moment,” she says, and disappears for a moment to drop this laundry into her bedroom. When she comes out and we get to talk for a while she is nice, hospitable, and neat in appearance. When we all leave, she for class and Nora and I to embark on the next leg of our journey, I feel more as though I’ve just stayed at a bed and breakfast than as though I’ve met a new Internet friend in real life. Our trip to St. Louis takes longer than anticipated. We arrive in the darkness of night, but Tessie and her friends aren’t affected by the hour. As we park in the residential area north of the city we see Tessie outside, waving to us. She introduces us to Therese, whose house this is, and Alisha, another friend who is hanging out with them. They’re fun-loving post-teens, and I can see as soon as introductions are made that they’re the sort who love to craft a magical world of zany car rides and absurd adventures. I’ve also arranged that I should meet with my Internet friend Anne, who recently graduated from NYU and presently resides in Northern Michigan, who is in St. Louis to visit her parents. Everyone’s up to the idea of spending time at a coffee shop. Anne’s presence—I haven’t managed to make any substantial guesses in advance what she’d be like. Once we’ve spoken a bit, though, her Internet presence seems suddenly to make more sense. Her demeanor says, “I reserve the right to shoot you down if you attempt to talk to me,” although actual conversation with her flows quite smoothly (for me, at least) and I find myself comfortable in her presence. She tells me about this and that. Our conversation merges with the conversations the others are having, and eventually I wander off to once again beat my high score at Galaga. Next we go to a Steak n’ Shake, where, over hamburgers, we listen to Tessie tell us about the time she got to hold a human brain in her hands. 95 There’s a drive to Cleveland. We arrive at Alicia’s, again late in the evening. Our return trip is being hurried along much more than our westward adventure. We sleep. In the morning, Alicia takes us to a nice little restaurant down the street. 96 From Cleveland we zoom forth directly to Massachusetts. We hope to arrive unexpected and triumphant at Necrology. Nora drops me off at my house to pick up my car. I drive my car but run out of gas on I-91 before I can get to Hadley. Nora, fortunately, is following me, pulls over as she sees me do so, and lets me use her cell phone to call Bruce, my mother’s boyfriend, who brings gas with him. Then we proceed to what we think will be the club but find that, contrary to our expectations, it’s not happening this week. After a quick coffee at the Whately Diner, I grab my things from her car and we go our separate ways. The road trip is over. 97 Time begins to get wacky again. Sleeping on a loveseat, at first, haunted by strange dreams. But then a section of my mom’s basement is curtained off and a waterbed is put in. Levi circa late Spring, 2002 is almost twenty-one years old. I have nice eyes. There are people on the Internet who like to read my thoughts. I’ll go for a walk, exit my neighborhood, hope to avoid the skunks, down the street, over the train tracks, past the cemetery (which Maxine once claimed that she recognized from a dream), then past the old fruit stand—is it abandoned or is my memory just caught in permanent winter?—then past more train tracks, the high school where I promised myself that I would be strong, forward to the 7-11. The last time I went there, the man behind the counter was praying as he counted my money. I thought he was singing. He said that he would sing for me sometime. He never did. In my childhood I thought that the most capable earned the highest salary. I thought that someone was going to give me advice eventually. For the most part I am a quiet person, because I learned to speak onstage. I wait for a cue that only occasionally comes. In late spring, 2002, I decided that I needed to move out from my mom’s basement. I started to ask around, did anyone need a roommate? I had set this as a goal for myself. Someone suggested an open room with someone I knew but didn’t know well. It was very inexpensive. $150/mo. With someone named Barry. Mornings were a little bit tough. He made a lot of noise. I remember waking up to the sound of him yelling at someone over the phone about financial matters, asking to speak with their supervisor. It feels like that happened several times. And Jonny got in touch with me and said that this guy we knew, Jim—Jonny knew him better than I did—had just gotten a drum kit, that we should go over there and jam, try out some of my songs. I said okay. Maurice was online, so I asked him if he would like to join in, too, using his new bass guitar. We all plugged in. I started off by playing my song “Flight of the Angel”. Our first time trying it, Jonny came up with a great lead riff. This riff was pretty much what convinced all of us that we should try to keep playing together. For the second rehearsal we brought in Patrick on keyboard. And the five of us began to rehearse regularly. "

    "body": "98 A venture was made to Reverie in Cambridge on the night I turned twenty-one. It was the same crowd I went to Manray with the last time I headed to Boston, only I wasn’t driving this time and we didn’t end up in obscure parts of the state trying to find our way home. I enjoyed myself thoroughly, even if it was a laid-back experience to drive 100 miles for. Hopefully the others weren’t too bored, since admittedly I’m easily pleased. I re-read a Bone graphic novel and experienced the first issue of I Feel Sick for the first time. My first legally consumed drink in the United States was a rum and Coke. 99 My first day making sandwiches in exchange for a regular paycheck in my hometown of Chicopee, Massachusetts. Whenever I go anywhere in this city I feel like I’m being forced to watch videos of a crazy uncle singing karaoke while intoxicated. I’ve always gone to other towns for employment since the brief period of time I spent washing dishes under the table ($5/hr. ) and busing tables ($3. 50/hr. plus a percentage of the waitresses’ tips) when I was fifteen. So, this feels different. The sexual harassment of various employees is constant. Everybody hates everybody and seems ready to explode. 	When I think about it, many of the jobs I’ve held have been humorously inappropriate for me. Like my brief stint as retail security: the others who held the same job title exchanged stories about how great their previous jobs had been, when they were able to chase people, wrestle them to the ground, and get paid for it. There was my time at a store specializing in videocassettes and DVDs: “Sorry, I don’t watch television, I never bothered to hook up my set,” I would say. And my illustrious career at Electronics Boutique: “No, I don’t have a Playstation 2. I haven’t bought a video game system since the Sega CD. ” 100 Today was my second day of training. Groggy when I first arrived, I pointed out to my superiors that I didn’t yet know what 3/4 of the sandwiches listed on the menu were, let alone how to make them. They shrugged, threw pickles at each other and made jokes about fellatio for the better part of two hours. So, stressed and confused, when some customers distracted them from my presence I snuck out back for a cigarette break. A woman had been wandering around the back room, I had figured she was just an employee waiting to start her shift or something. She was now sitting near the entrance to the huge, open, empty warehouse-type space behind the restaurant that is used only to store a few cardboard boxes and a tin can of cigarette butts. She joined me for a smoke. We chatted a little. She made a comment that suggested she wasn’t an employee at this particular location of the sandwich chain, even though she was stopping by to see people here. I asked her at which location she worked. She said Northampton. I said I spent a lot of time in Northampton, that I knew a lot of people there. She said she thought she had seen me around and asked me if I know a Robyn. I answered that I know a Robyn, but that she wasn’t from Massachusetts originally. “No, the Robyn I’m talking about is always in Massachusetts,” she said. I asked for her name. I vaguely recognized having heard it before. “Wait,” she said, “Do you know an Erica who goes to Emerson College? She’s not from Northampton, but she goes there sometimes. ” I answered that I didn’t. Our conversation only continued for a brief period of time following this, as she listed off a couple of other names that I didn’t recognize. She seemed surprised that I didn’t know any of them. Following this, one of my co-workers arrived to start her shift, but then received a distressing phone call (the details of which I did not get to hear) and hurried out of the store. This left only me, another trainee and one other employee to handle the rush of customers at 5 PM on a Friday. So, I stayed for two hours longer than I had been scheduled to work. It was a good trial by fire. Five hours after the first time I ever used a grill in my life, I felt pretty secure in what I was doing and had memorized much of that menu which earlier in the afternoon had seemed so alien. Then Marie picked me up and we went to the Enfield Denny’s. She wrote out the work schedule for her store’s employees (at a clothing store in the mall), then we went through the usual talk of personal worries, drama, and the recitation of poetry. 101 A girl named Zella said she had written a poem about me, after the night we’d chatted at Necrology, and that she was going to read it at Word on Wednesday. When she did read it, the next week, I didn’t know how to respond, except to thank her. 102 I have a bedroom to call my own now, orange balloon tied to one of the windows, not yet designed or even really filled with much that I own. Barry needed someone to take this room and split the rent, I needed an apartment, bang-zoom. Still in Chicopee. He’s sleeping in his room now. Spending money might start to be an iffy thing until I find a second job or one that gives better hours, but the benefits to my mindset have been obvious so far. I’m reluctant to take trips back to my mother’s house now, because whenever I walk through that door I feel like I’m stepping off a steep cliff. I explored alleyways alone in Northampton tonight because I drove all the way to the Hampshire Mall to return some birthday presents before realizing that it was 8 PM on a Sunday. The night before, I went to Diva’s for the after-party to the Pride parade. 103 The sign at the D’angelo’s in Holyoke reads: “LOBSTER IS BACK! HELP WANTED” I laughed for like ten minutes straight when I saw that. 104 My supervisor: “I’ll let you go out for a smoke, but just so you know, you’re not supposed to get a break unless your shift is at least six hours. ” Me: “Isn’t that kind of illegal?” My supervisor: “Do we seem like we’d care?” 105 At Haven I was talking to Katie. Mick had introduced us. After the club night was over we ended up going to the 591 Diner across the street and chatting. I think it was with, like, Patrick and… Kevin, maybe? And Mick and just that sort of crowd. Also Katie’s friend, who was visiting from California, was there. Katie’s friend was upset, for some reason. Her angst was evidenced by the way she snuffed the candle at our table with her fingers. It’s funny how little I can really remember about this period of time. I think I was writing a lot of songs… or at least going for a lot of walks at night while listening to my songs. And lying on my bed alone and mostly naked, maybe reading, doing anything that didn’t involve much movement, because of the heat… it was quickly turning into a hot summer. But anyway, that night when Katie’s friend from California was in town, Katie and I shared the bed in my room, cuddling each other. I don’t know if she and I had kissed at this point. We eventually did, but nothing went further than that. In the morning, Barry remarked on how he’d come home to see Katie’s friend on the living room floor in only a tee and panties and like, wow, so he asked, “Are those two your toys?” and I was like, um, no. It was gross. I still didn’t know much about Barry, other than that he really liked Oingo Boingo and Green Lantern. And I saw some of the common space of Katie’s Amherst College dorm house. She either had already moved out—having just graduated—or she was still in the process of moving out. I looked at books while she chatted with the younger students she knew. She drove me around playing cassette tapes she had from when she had been a DJ for the college radio station. She had lots of compact discs and more debt than I had ever heard of anyone in that age range having. She was the person who taught me how to use a credit card at a bar, accidentally forget it there at the end of the night, then come back for it the next week wearing an embarrassed expression. A lot of our interactions during this period of time were group interactions, too, like at the World War II Club for karaoke on Fridays. With Rick and Bryan and Kay and Polly and Kevin and Smarf. The place was always packed by a twentysomething crowd that loved ’70s punk and ’90s hip hop. That periscope at the table, which turned around. And oh! I remember holding Katie’s hand there. That was where my attention was. I was holding her hand. It was still exciting, even at the age of twenty-one. Holding hands. Yes. And, oh! Going with her to her hometown in Connecticut. Her little apartment type thing, a separate area of her parents’ house. It was nice. She liked pasta with pesto. While she showered I read an Invisibles graphic novel, which she kept on her bookshelf. She showed me her music collection. Sleeping next to her, and oh my goodness, that was when we just cuddled cuddled! With this fantastic unsatisfied intensity. So I guess we did more than just kiss, if we cuddled. And we definitely cuddled. Is cuddling “more” than kissing? And in the morning, stopping at the convenience store, and the guy there who recognized her because he had known her all her life, in a small town. And we went to a park, where for all intents and purposes we were alone. It was comfortable enough but a little bit breezy. We sat on a rock. It was so nice to sit on that rock next to Katie. We talked about the people we knew in common. She was surprised, considering the people we knew in common, that there were so many people we didn’t know in common. She was a good person. Maybe there were leagues: I felt that she was out of mine, even if she didn’t know it yet. 106 I drive to Patrick’s place. He’s outside, smoking cigarettes. He points to where I should park, on the grass. We all climb into his car and listen to loud music on the way to Lowell. Getting the directions via cell phone while driving eastbound on the Mass Pike, we each take turns screwing up the navigation, to such an absurd degree that we pass through Boston. Patrick and I meet Jonny, Jim, and Bald Adam. Jim, Patrick, and Bald Adam all have cameras, so Jonny gets them in for free. Everyone splits the cost of my admission. The idea is not to go too far with saying everyone’s photographing for the band. I’m somewhat familiar with noise as a genre, so the first few acts I see don’t surprise me too much. I’m enjoying myself. The night only begins to strike me as strange once the first act takes the stage. One member speaks, explaining that reality is painful, that freedom is harmful, and that the sounds being played contain subliminal messages to homogenize us. The crowd sits silently in chairs near to the stage while a projection reads, “Watch TV” and the vocalist vomits into a bucket. The band in which Jonny is performing, features two drummers, a keyboardist/vocalist, and Jonny on guitar. Their performance is eclipsed, however, by the person they placed in front of the stage, who grinds metal to send sparks on the audience and destroys several computer monitors with a sledgehammer. It’s then audience participation time, as random people take turns beating the metal and computers. The table the computers were on is overturned while the vocalist screams about Palestine. A mannequin head is burned, and the table itself finally begins to take a beating, joining the scattered bits of the monitors that now cover the floor. Scraps are thrown across the room. It’s general chaos until the lights are turned on and a man from the club yells that the show’s over and that everyone needs to leave now. We all help Jonny to take his equipment outside hurriedly. We also help the band’s vocalist with some of his equipment. He’s nonchalant about the way the show went. “That’s what they get for double-booking the night of our show twice in a row,” he says. We drive back west, not getting lost this time. 107 I wake up at 5:00 PM the day of my first full-length musical set. It seems my primary alarm clock never went off. My secondary alarm clock mysteriously disappeared some days or weeks ago. The phone is for me. It’s Maurice. He asks for clarification about the time of my performance. I tell him that it’s at 8:30. I offer him a ride as well, but he says this won’t be necessary. In Easthampton, the first person I see is Jonny. The second is Alice. Once I enter Capo’s, the third person I see is Carolyn, who works there. The fourth person I see is my father. “Hello,” I’m saying to Carolyn at the moment when I recognize him. “And… hello…” I say. I walk by him quickly and place the equipment that I’m carrying onto the stage. “I thought we could talk,” he says to me. I don’t stop walking while he speaks. I never look him in the eye. “You have a way of picking the worst times to try communicating with me,” I tell him, “I can’t. I don’t even have five minutes to spare right now. ” I continue to bring things in, to set things up. The band Second to Mecca enters. I explain that I’ve been booked to play a half-hour set before they go on. While I’m plugging into the P. A. , my father walks up onto the stage and talks to me some more. I reassert that I don’t have time for a discussion. He says that he’s leaving the area tomorrow to return to South Carolina. I vaguely suggest that I might be able to meet him somewhere the next day. “When?” he asks. “I don’t know,” I say, “In the morning, maybe. 8, 6, 4 AM. It doesn’t matter. I’ll be awake. ” For whatever reason, though, he changes the subject and hands me fifty dollars. He asks if he can have a hug goodbye. I say that no, he can’t. He leaves. I find that the battery for my guitar’s pickup has died, so we have to mic it instead. Since I play while standing, this is awkward, and means that I won’t be able to move around while playing like I usually do. After some confusion about whether there’s an extra mic stand hanging around, I perform: I Melt/My Favorite Color is You/Every Catch Phrase/Pieces/Skin/Stay for a Rainy Day/Flight of the Angel. I struggle to follow the rhythm of the backing track that I sequenced for “I Melt”. I miss a transition in “My Favorite Color is You” and give up close to the end of the song, knowing that I won’t be able to pretend I didn’t screw up because the drum track follows the way the song is supposed to go. I blame it on the fact that my pick is broken, though in actuality the pick had been broken for most of the song. After this I decide I’m not going to attempt to play “Last Life”, the other song I had arranged backing for, because I hadn’t been able to rehearse it enough. The rest of the set is acoustic. Unfortunately, my mood, and at times my performance, is dragged down because I begin to think negative thoughts while playing. I’m a zombie afterward. I wait for the customers at the counter to get their drinks so that I can get my own. Once I have that, I go outside for a cigarette. Second To Mecca has set up and is already playing by now, having already covered Ben Folds Five’s “Magic” and now in the midst of a slow-tempo version of “Baby One More Time”. The people who came to see me were Alice, Jonny, Adam, Patrick, Julia H. , Social Worker Michelle, Alice’s mom, Katie, and Maurice. This was more of a crowd than the act I opened up for had. I think that this might be worth something, though I’m not sure. The support of my friends is worth more than any of that, though, of course. We hang outside for a bit. I drive Maurice home. That night, in the span of a walk to and from the gas station down the street, I am yelled at from car windows twice. Some things still haven’t changed. "

Shifts spent with only myself there to ring purchases, keep things stocked, keep things cleaned. Customers freaking out and knocking things over and yelling at me, trying to seduce each other, making jokes about holding me up at gunpoint or trying to be my friend. The elderly giving the bulk of their money to the state lottery. Kids buying Vitamin Water. Lots of coffee. People insisting that they needed half and half, not milk, so yes they’ll wait until I’m not busy so that I can change it. Every time there are no customers in the store, I try to fit in the smoking of a cigarette. I go through many, many 1/4 smoked cigarettes. And I think about beauty at the end of my work shift. Yes, I stand behind the counter with my co-worker, a thirty-year-old man who mumbles a lot and asks the younger female customers if they’ll take him home with them. Sometimes I feel like a glutton: he’d pay for the worst of my days on earth, although here we are, from apparently the same background, in the same area, same country. He hates beauty so much because if only, if only he could be beautiful… and of course he neither understands nor respects women. My sympathies are wasted, so I continue forward as if I’ve passed a dead raccoon on the highway. 110 “Do you believe in me?” I ask Robyn. “What, like, believe that you exist?” “Well, sure, answer it that way. ” “Yes, I believe you exist. ” “And…” (Annoyed): “I don’t believe in almost anyone. Don’t take it personally, okay?” (Another random time she called me, then we hung out, then I didn’t see her again for a long time…) 111 The Levi Adams Rock Quintet performed tonight: Every Catch Phrase, My Favorite Color is You, I Melt, Extinguish to Vapor, The Password, Stay for a Rainy Day (Solo), Flight of the Angel. All things considered, the show went well. I had a lot of fun and was in good spirits for the entire set (unlike my solo show earlier this month, during which I was an emotional wreck). My mother was there. She reportedly cried. Reviewing the tape, it’s obvious that we still aren’t very tight as a band. The rushed nature of our preparations is evident. Still, I really like that we all sound like we care about what we’re doing. 112 When I was alone in Northampton with no possibilities for friendly fun remaining, I walked at a steady and respectable pace along main street and a kid was squatting around Cha Cha Cha (the burrito place) and said something about the pointlessness of reality and I (cutely, or at least so I like to think) said, “Reality?!” in a whiny voice not unlike that of a small child saying, “Clean my room?!” and after I passed him I heard something like, “Some change?” and without turning around I shrugged my shoulders to explain that I couldn’t spare any, but then he came running up to me, put a dollar bill in my hand, and said, “Here, you need some change,” leaving me to look curiously from the dollar bill to him as he ran back in the direction from which he came. 113 When Maurice and I arrived at the Enfield Denny’s around 12:30 AM we found that Marie was there, chatting it up with a one-legged sixtysomething-year-old man who had without provocation approached to ask if he could sit with her. 114 Tonight a cat was hanging around outside the store. She stayed there for the entire time that I worked. She was very friendly and appeared to be in good health except for what looked like a tattoo of an encircled “x” on her ear. I grew very attached and spent much of my time between customers sitting outside with this kitty on my lap. She was very excitable and affectionate. I got the impression that she couldn’t have been stray for long at all. At one point, I brought out a cup of water. (A customer had already fed her cat food earlier in the night. ) She appraised the water, appeared disinterested, then caught and ate a flying insect. After my shift I picked her up and started walking. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. I figured to call an animal shelter or something, which I could have done from the store, but… I dunno. My mind works in odd ways. So anyway, I carried her around Northampton. I headed toward Robyn’s house, even though it was 6:30 AM, because I wanted someone else’s opinion and figured someone might be awake there for some reason. On the way the cat jumped out of my arms several times when she was distracted by birds or squirrels or mysterious scents to pursue, but never left my general vicinity. I got to Robyn’s and knocked on the door. The weird thing about her apartment is that no one there can hear a knock on the door unless they’re in the kitchen, or maybe the living room. At least I knew for sure that I wasn’t going to wake anyone up. But, yeah. That was to no avail. Then, I tried dialing 411 from a phone booth for the number to some place that could refer me to somewhere that could help me. I was transferred to a number, but then the phone said that I should have dialed 1 plus the area code or something. I asked a couple in front of Sylvester’s what they thought. They confirmed that the cat looked to be in good shape, and just suggested to call a shelter. I brought the cat back to DB Mart and used the phone book, but I couldn’t find any appropriate numbers and Paul, who was now working, said that I probably wouldn’t have any luck since it was Sunday, anyway. So I left her at the DB Mart, hoping that the way she hadn’t strayed from the parking lot was evidence that she belonged to someone who lived nearby who had just left her out for the night or something. 115 Harvey developed a plan to make some money. He talked to a church and reserved a space in which to hold an art show. He got some bands to play, artists to display their work, and he charged admission. This way, he figured, he would be able to pay his rent. Wearing a skirt, I played a long set. I think the setlist was: The Password, My Melody Was Stolen, Skin, Flight of the Angel, Woman in Bed, Every Catch Phrase, Hopeless, I Melt, Revolution of Love, Eyes of a Stranger, My Favorite Color is You. 116 A guy came into the store and asked if he could buy a cigarette lighter “on faith”. It was an expensive one, too: not one of the 79 cent lighters, but one of the $5. 99 lighters. He would come back later and pay for it, he promised. I told him that I wouldn’t be working in the morning, that I couldn’t do it, my drawer would be short. He asked the next customer who came in if he would buy it for him. To my surprise, the stranger agreed. While the stranger was grabbing a gallon of milk for himself and this man who so desired the lighter was standing in front of the counter, he mumbled something about the eyes of God, then added, “But I understand that you have laws to follow. We are beyond reproach, right?” “Excuse me?” More loudly now: “We are beyond reproach! Yes?” “I…” Glaring, looking ready to explode: “We are beyond reproach!” “We?” “Yes,” he said, calming down. I later saw him break a bottle of alcohol onto the sidewalk, standing up from the spot where he had been alternating between mumbling cryptically and shouting. Then he started berating the guy who told him that it wasn’t cool to kick the broken glass into the grass where kids and pets frequently run around. 117 Humility is for liars. 118 Pursuing happiness in the freedom-from. 119 When I arrived at practice, I realized that I had forgotten my guitar. Granted, this wasn’t so bad as the time I drove a half hour to practice only to realize that I had forgotten our bassist. 120 I’m eating a slice of pizza on the sidewalk, sitting by myself, when I hear a car crash. I stand and look across the street. Everyone seems okay. Meanwhile, a woman who seems European stops to talk to a guy who says, “I’m going to have my girlfriend pull my tooth out. ” “Oh, wow. It’s all black,” the woman says, looking into the guy’s mouth. (Work. ) “But hey, that’s all right. You’ve got your music playing, you’re all right. ” “Yeah. ” “Hey. (He pauses for effect. ) Keep being good, okay?” I laugh, “Okay. ” (A guy stumbles in. ) “Hey, man, help me out…” (He’s inebriated. ) “I don’t know what I should do. ” “Help you with what?” I ask. He leaves the store and doesn’t come back. (The rock n’ roll bar guy. ) “You know what would be cool? If you could get a video camera of your own in here and record for a few weeks, then splice it together. I bet you could sell that to some producer. ” He asks for a $5 scratch ticket. I tell him to close his eyes and pick a number between 26 and 39, to decide which he’ll buy. He does. He wins $200. 121 A couple outside the store: she, on the pay phone, looking frustrated; he, making jokes and saying to her, “Come on, aren’t I sexy?” while she repeatedly said, “I’m not in the mood for this. I’m on edge. ” When he came in, he joined the long list of strangers who’ve tried to get me to agree with the statement, “Women. Ya just can’t please ‘em. ” I stay silent. 122 I drive with Maurice to Mr. B’s, an eating establishment where I can’t stop laughing because the big lettering in the windows—”We just don’t serve great ice cream”—is still there. In the old apartment where I’ve been living with Barry, I put $100 on the table, take two boxes of my things and leave. After last night’s occasion of helping a customer to choose a scratch ticket which won him $200, tonight I help a different customer to win $2,000. If the next time I work I sell a $20,000 winner, I should probably quit this job to become a professional psychic. 123 At band practice we solidified our new, weirder, material, then played through Friday’s setlist. We made a fan in a teenage girl who lived in Jonny’s neighborhood. At Jonny’s kitchen table I started to sing the theme to The Brady Bunch and got everyone to join in. This included Maurice, who beat-boxed. 124 Katie didn’t know what to say, didn’t know what she felt. I leaned against her car. Earlier, when she had been talking about male entitlement, it had been like being little and going to see The Care Bears Movie, man. I was just so happy to be there for it. Eighteen hours later, while sitting outside a coffee shop, I said that I hadn’t heard from Robyn in a very long time. When she approached two minutes later I laughed, so we walked to her house, where she gave me Magic Hat beer to drink. I don’t think I’d ever before heard “I met someone” mean in reality what it means in the movies, but there it did. 125 Tina was moving in as Lydia’s roommate. The two of them had a housewarming party. I had a bad feeling about the night. I got there, said hello to everyone, cuddled next to Mandy for a little bit, then left to work the overnight at the DB Mart. Hearing about that party the next day was my first time hearing about Ian, when Mandy told me, “Yeah, that party was strange. I ended up making out with a boy before finding out he was seventeen and gay. ” Although Ian would never be an important character in my life, I would be seeing him around in the following years. 126 The trip to Prince Edward Island, Canada had been planned in advance. A drive up there with Jonny and Alice (who had been dating each other for a while at this point). I didn’t have the money to be spending on this trip, but since I had agreed to come along I felt obligated to go through with it. Jonny didn’t like to make a lot of stops while driving, so we didn’t get to explore anything as we passed through Maine. I had just bought a copy of what was then the new Bright Eyes album, Lifted. Alice said she enjoyed it, but Jonny said it really wasn’t his type of music. We got into Canada and kept driving, driving. It was nighttime when we reached the Island. I had been wanting to change my currency to Canadian dollars, but Jonny hadn’t wanted to. Any place we went to would accept our money, he had said. I felt like it was sort of… rude to visit another country without even bothering to use their currency. We got to the campground, then. It was dark while Jonny set up the tent. He was acting like a father who just hadn’t got around to starting a family yet. The next day, we saw some sights. There was the beach. Standing at the top of that cliff with the wind blowing. I played guitar and sang. Alice took pictures. One of those pictures would be the cover for the CD I recorded on my own a few months later (called Photographs). I remember some town, talking to some woman in some store. She talked about the area. I remember walking around in a different town, then. Finally getting Canadian money. I liked Canadian money. I bought a big Pepsi in a glass bottle. Why were all sodas only sold in glass bottles on Prince Edward Island? We ate at some place that had really good pizza and… a bread bar! This excited me. I loved bread. At night, we went to a bar. There were bands playing. It was Alice’s first time legally drinking anywhere—she was still under the age of twenty-one. As time passed, more people came in. I played the little touch-screen computer game machine. Alice was popular among strangers. We all talked plenty with the locals, who were friendly and interested in hearing about us. There was a motel in the middle of nowhere. I wrote in my journal: “Time is uncertain. Prince Edward Island, town uncertain. Two nights at a campground, tonight a hotel in the middle of nowhere on a lonely stretch of road. A smell like that of a grandma’s house. Dreaming as soon as I dozed off, that someone was here with me, a romantic interest, but red-eyed—not with irritated eyes, mind you, but with actual red irises. This person, a woman, jumped on me with the enthusiasm of a child, asked me to join her in a walk. ‘Okay,’ I said, ‘But only if we can go slowly and you’ll hold my hand. ’ Outside, there were wheat fields surrounding the motel. She wants to walk through them: “It’ll be fun!” Beginning to enter, footing uncertain, she’s pulling me forward. I’m moving hesitantly. ‘I’m scared,’ I say. ‘Of what? It’s wheat!’ ‘I’ve never walked through wheat before!’ I’m disappointing her. It’s less fun when you walk slowly, she says. ” The next day, we went to the Ripley’s Believe It or Not! museum. The three of us were all in a sort of weird mood. We stopped in St. John, New Brunswick on the way home. There was music by the water. 127 20/20 is on, with an installment about beauty. Their finding? Men choose to view pictures of women they rate as beautiful for a long time, but not to view pictures of men they rate as beautiful for a long time. Women view for long periods of time both the men and the women they rate as beautiful. “Women are sizing up the competition,” it’s suggested, “Since they know that they need to meet these standards of beauty in order to attract men. ” It’s weird how people are such morons. (That annoying Paula Cole song is used in a commercial in the next room, loudly. I wait to be able to think again. ) I’ve pissed off enough friends to know that people will do their best to convince me that I’m either masculine or feminine, dominant or submissive, impulsive or intentional. They’ll go to great lengths to get me to say, “Yes, I suppose I am [a label]. ” Then the label begins to eat away at me and I can’t handle it anymore. They run off disappointed or I push them away. Then someone else will come along, arguing that I am the opposite of what the last person tried to tell me I was… "

    "body": "128 I think my father told me, maybe twelve years old—the memory is mixed with memories of the nighttime Mount Holyoke range and a pop song playing, What goes around comes around, that’s what people say—he said, “There are some gays who want to reclaim the word ‘queer’. ” It sounded like a cool rebellion, although I still didn’t want to kiss any boys—or girls, for that matter. (I never wanted to kiss anyone until I first just wanted to be held, held out of compassion. ) Given infinite time, all labels will be reclaimed. 129 A man remains in the store for twenty minutes. He has a date tomorrow, to the fair. Do I have a girlfriend? No? Ugh, women. They’re nothing but trouble, he says. This one’s an eighteen-year-old. He’s twenty-eight, but she’s legal. A co-worker. Other co-workers told her he wouldn’t stop making crude remarks about her ass. Weren’t they scumbags? Who doesn’t say things like that about the new girl? They’re just jealous, like this one guy, he just wishes he could get her in the sack himself, wants to ruin his chances. So he wants to treat her right, to afford to pay for her. I suggest that he not buy that next scratch ticket, after he has counted his money aloud. He thanks me for the suggestion. I hand him the next ticket. He walks away with twenty-five dollars spent and only four dollars in winning tickets. Well, good, then, you bastard. 130 Keeping track of my dreams, until I’m remembering multiple dreams almost every night. A dream in which I woke up from my dream and looked to the red-eyed woman, who herself was dreaming. I waited until she seemed to be partially awake, then whispered her name. But it wasn’t her name that I whispered. The name I whispered was Caela, like the character in my play, pronounced “kai-lah”. I knew that wasn’t the woman’s name, but she responded immediately. She said that she had been dreaming of me. I said that my dream had involved her, too, and that we should both talk about our dreams. In my dream, I explained to her, I had just awoken. I was in a house, but in this house was the counter of a convenience store. A blond-haired woman was working the counter. I asked for two scratch tickets and paid for them, but she ran off before thinking to give them to me. I followed her outside, to the yard outside of my mother’s house, and the red-eyed woman was there, looking up at the tree. She took off the dress she was wearing and starting trying to climb the tree. I asked the convenience store clerk what was going on, and she became very flustered: “I can’t tell you that. You’re not supposed to have come in here. ” She scurried around my mom’s house as I tried to convince her to just talk to me. I eventually gave up and ran down the street. Out of frustration I climbed a tree myself, a different tree, without even thinking—climbed it to the top and even hopped above its tip before making my way back down the branches. And that, I told the red-eyed woman, was my dream. The red-eyed woman’s expression was difficult to read. Finally she just said okay and went into telling me about her dream, in which I had been trying to sell her. Only, she said, when she tried to get the support of her friends, as she didn’t want to be sold, they all acted as if that was just the way things went—that people were bought and sold all the time. 131 As usual I wasn’t wearing my glasses, at Fire &amp; Water, poetry reading going on. I sat by myself. I put down the new issue of the Valley Advocate (the local alternative weekly), sipped my coffee, watched the performer, but then I saw someone talking to Gooselove, and though she was somewhat far away and I could only see her from behind and her hair was shorter than I’d ever known it to be, I recognized Carrie’s body language. She walked past me, then, saw me and said hello. She’d been gone for a year and no one I’d asked had known what happened to her. I approached her. We had a brief exchange of words while she was waiting at the counter, but the congested nature of that space interfered and we didn’t talk further. Tina came by toward the end of my night there, gave a review of what’s new in her life (as if giving a briefing on a mission). She was wearing a Save Ferris shirt, saying that she felt like herself again. At that time I was sitting next to Graff on top of the dumpster thing, cross-legged. She showed off her nice new paperjournal while Nellie and Zella stood by. I sat on the wall on Old South Street for awhile, with my guitar, because I had been paying attention to life all night and everything I had heard was coalescing into lyrics that were forming in my head. Midway through the songwriting process a guy came up to bum a smoke and had me play a song for him. He played piano, he said, hopefully playing at the Bishop’s Lounge this fall, but he didn’t push the matter of his musicianship, wasn’t too proud. I was pretty sure this was the same guy who had bought hard boiled eggs from the convenience store while I was working, who had then eaten them off the counter by the fountain sodas, who had then asked if he could have a little milk from the coffee creamer machine to wash it down with. (Of course I let him. ) 132 I pick up Maurice in Springfield. The night is beautiful, just beautiful. I skip around, saying, “This is what life is supposed to be!” When we get to the Enfield Denny’s, Marie is there with her friend whose name I don’t remember. We are socially in Marie-ville for some time, then: I build a phallus from creamers so that she can knock it over, her friend grabs me close so that he can dramatically recite lines from The Ren + Stimpy Show. Marie doesn’t stay for long after her friend has left. She gives me a more intense goodbye embrace than I would have expected from Marie, who usually doesn’t touch me much. (If I hug her I feel like it either needs to be a short hug or I need to have prepared by putting on a raincoat of some sort because it’ll feel like she’s ready to explode and to cover me with something that I imagine would resemble ectoplasm. ) While eating, and for a while after we’ve finished, Maurice and I have a conversation about our futures, about our musical endeavors. When we get back to his house he stays in the car to smoke a cigarette and to listen to the rest of the Tool song that’s on the radio. In the quiet night we both notice more about the music than we usually would. 133 I always start things that I never bother to finish—like days. After work on Thursday Maurice was waiting for me, outside. Through headphones he was listening to “Datura” by Tori Amos, pacing, gravitating away from the artificial light. I said hey and he cooly changed direction, wearing armsocks. We went to Capo’s. I just wanted to find myself some coffee and to find a table and to sit there in a chair with my legs crossed, relaxed, watching goths zip by like cats chasing invisible prey. Mandy was there at a table with Erin, whom she’s getting to know. I joined them, felt strange because the dynamic of the conversation didn’t seem to change with my presence. I was outside smoking with a couple of strangers when Efrain (working at Capo’s) came out to say, “Just so you know, if the cops see you hanging outside, they’ll arrest you,” which was enough to get me to extinguish my cigarette. To the Whately Diner. Robyn was at the counter with her boyfriend. She didn’t say hi. It made me a little sad. Mandy and Erin and Whitehouse and a somebody else came along. There was food-eating. I picked lint off Mandy. The word “meta-flogging” was invented. 134 There was the job interview, which itself was such a positive experience that even if I don’t get the position, I can say it was a fun time. It was refreshing to hear, “I haven’t seen someone come through here with your level of skills for awhile now”, instead of the usual, “Will you take the job/shift that no one else will take? Okay. Come dressed for work tomorrow. ” Then, for some reason, I hung out in Barnes and Noble. Then I came home and considered sleep but didn’t feel immediately capable of it. Since I had woken up as a delayed reaction to a message left on the machine by my manager—he was working the counter because the person scheduled to work second shift had called out and no one else could fill in so could I come in as early as possible for my scheduled overnight shift? I went in two and a half hours early, already feeling goofy and sleep-deprived. As it turned out, he forgot to mention that I would be training someone on her first day of work. In fact, it was her first day of any sort of work in about three years. By the way, her poetry was published twenty-something times in the last year. Could she take her shoes off? Don’t worry, her feet don’t smell. She shouldn’t have come in those shoes, next time she’ll wear this certain other pair of shoes. Could she bum a smoke? But I can’t tell anyone she smokes. That’s why she didn’t bring any cigarettes today. She worked in a Dairy Mart a number of years back, so she didn’t need a lot of training. At the end of her shift, gathering her paperwork, she noticed a ticket for the numbers game that had either been printed out accidentally or left by a customer. Checking it against the winning numbers, we realized that it was approximately a $100 winner. She took it and promised to give me half of the winnings on Monday. She did not. 135 I begin training Monday for my new employment as a relay operator, facilitating TTY-to-telephone conversations. 136 I don’t feel like I’m suddenly a woman, in those clothes if somebody who dresses in clothes from the women’s section leaves a skirt on my floor or I buy from some little store a nice dress and suddenly I’m worming evasively through some affectionate and well-intentioned yet annoying human being’s attempts to read my style, my preference, or gods forbid an orientation. But I can drift away. Books of theory I buy as rebellion. My friends meanwhile know that they won’t handle me long because they can’t find my handles. When I was like ten I watched a talk show, as in a daytime talk show, and I asked what gay people were and my mom said they were men who love each other in the way that men usually love women, and I said, “That’s what I’m gonna be” because I was teased when I hung with girls, so even then I knew that socializing was this thing I couldn’t understand, only then I thought it was, like, unquestionable to grow up and marry, early twenties, have kids ‘cuz God gives ‘em to a married couple, I dunno, rolling the dice to decide how many or whatever. The guy next to me asks what I’m working on: “Free writing?” he asks. “Yeah, I haven’t done that in a while,” I reply. He’s attractive. “What’s that show?” he asked, “That’s on at night?” “Oh. That one!” “Where they give the answer and you need to figure out the question. ” “Jeopardy!” “Yeah, that’s it. ” And he told me to have a good one and he left and he was an older guy and there’s a baby in front of me now and the mom (presumably) with orange juice and the baby’s crying and the two people, two men, both talking, one with pen in his mouth. 137 I could have joined my fellow trainees in going out for margaritas, but I already had made plans. I don’t taste that sort of culture much. I understand root beer crowds and whiskey crowds. Margarita crowds are more of an occasional, exotic thing for me. It’s always interesting to throw me into a situation with people of mixed age and middle income. They ask so many questions and when they get my answers they just want to ask more and more questions. I kind of like the challenge in that. 138 My father’s side of the family, I don’t know much about them. How do they live? I don’t know. The names of my relatives, they fade. But their houses, I remember, were always somewhat nicer than those of the people on my mother’s side. An only child, doing an anthropological study anytime I speak to someone, never spoke to my mom, really, except to appease like if she were a visiting landlord. I had theorized before experience, and was usually right. I find it difficult to believe others. I figure that if someone has a word for something it’s going to be gone before I can figure out what it ever meant. 139 Alix and Henry stopped to talk with me while I was writing by a storefront. Henry was wearing a shirt that said, “I love Alix”. They invited me to a movie. I told them that I’m a fool without an ATM card who forgets when banks are open. Henry paid my way in. We saw The Good Girl. I went to Harry’s. It was Aloha Steamtrain’s final show. Charlie had earlier said that he’d buy me a drink there. I found him, but he was spending the last of his money on a beer for the band’s singer. I stuck around for a bit, but it was crowded and hot, so I exited. Outside, Charlie was now talking with an older guy who liked to rap instead of talking. He told me that he was headed over to Kevin’s. We tried but were notified that he’s out of town. He had to sit at the bottom of the stairs. He was drunk. He had been stumbling. He wanted me to go with him to another bar. I said that I’d drive him to the Whately and get him some food instead. I buckled him in and lit his cigarette and drove. There was a kid with a guitar who sat outside the diner and played alternative rock songs. 140 The autumn, to me, is when the year feels at its most profound. Nothing I’ve known could replace a Massachusetts autumn. There’s such excitement in knowing that the same thing’s going to happen again, the leaves will be falling and breezes will shake them free in the night so that they’ll float down. And today there was ice cream. And playing the open mic at Harry’s, because I’m trying to figure out the equation that decides if and when someone in the bar will shout out, “Woo!” during a song. 141 A boy hopes to be President, but a girl hopes to be a Woman President. It’s thoughts like this that run through my head, again and again. I search for something that would justify my resentment toward the privileged role that’s been given to me. It’s not empathy. It’s not philosophy. Everyone understood why young girls with facial piercings were working at the convenience store. But why was I there? I was intelligent, friendly, in the prime of my life. I could do so much better, they said. I could create a hierarchy. Some people would believe in any religion, even the flowchart. I could say to someone, make a facsimile of this flowchart. Put minds where the little boxes are. Put coercion where the lines are. Ideologies where the arrows are. 142 Jonny, Katja and I went to South Hadley, where, at a gas station, I had to go through the “where do I know you from?” game with the employee. I didn’t want to say, “Yes, I’m pretty sure you were the kid on mushrooms at 4 AM on that dike,” but fortunately he first decided that he must remember me from Holyoke Community College. Jonny and I agreed that we’re willing to resume the recording of the Levi Adams Rock Quintet CD. 143 There was a social gathering, then. I knew the host in an obscure sort of way—talking online once about the softcore porn site she was on, after meeting through a dating site—but she didn’t remember that, she only knew that she had seen me around. Somebody asked permission to put her face into the cake? And as soon as she heard the word yes she lunged toward it, got a little bit on her face and then wiped it into the birthday girl’s hair? It was sort of a weird night. 144 I recorded bass tracks for the Rock Quintet CD with Maurice at Jonny’s. Then, later, it wasn’t a bring-a-gift party, but I gave the host (Millie) incense and let her sip of my wine and told her new girlfriend (one half of the married couple she was dating), ‘You’ll be okay’. I saw that unexpectedly, Alice’s friend Josh was there, as was Conor. I drank and in the pantry saw a picture of feet, then stepped over people and relaxed while partiers fell and glasses shattered. Conor’s idea of light conversation in Denny’s is most appropriate in the more obscure hours of the AM: weird theology, over bad coffee, just before the light shines in… "

    "body": "1 The final open stage at Fire &amp; Water was last night. Before I even played, someone I didn’t recognize came to the table where I sat, while I flipped through one of the café’s public notebooks. She said, “Levi, I just wanted to tell you that I really like your music. You have a great stage presence. ” Then she walked away. Not long after, someone else approached me and said that she saw me in the audience at one of the Tori Amos concerts, and we talked about Tori until it was my time to perform. I felt really good while I played my song, “Forever and a Day”. I went to grab a coffee. Someone said that from the back of the café he hadn’t heard a note of what I had played, but that he’d remarked to his friend about my wonderful energy. Then a guy I’ve seen around a lot is telling me that he felt like he wanted to help me out, somehow. “I don’t have money to do it, so I can’t say, like, ‘Here’s a couple thousand dollars, go get yourself recorded’… but I wish I could. ” Strangers aged thirty to fifty are most of the people who speak to me about my music. They tell me that I do it for all the right reasons. They tell me not to give up. They tell me to keep doing what I’m doing. When I shrug and spout out my thoughts about songwriting and performance, they watch me in that sort of way where I feel like they’re being inspired by me, or something. And I don’t know what they could think is so amazing about the fact that I write some songs sometimes and that I then play them for people, and that I then go back to wondering how I’m ever going to survive in this world. It’s weird to imagine that I can now give to others the inspiration that others gave to me, back in the recent past, when Levi the Songwriter Onstage seemed as unreasonable an aspiration as Levi the Contortionist in a Circus might seem to me now. 2 Though, my day had a lot more to it than just a good open mic performance. Desperation about being basically at the end of my financial reserves, seeking employment, and just… that feeling of, if only a stability could materialize in front of me, if only so much thought and scheming weren’t required just to figure out the basics. And walking alone through Northampton, until I happened upon someone I haven’t seen in months, Salma—we’ve been trying to get together for coffee for what, a year and a half now, since we met at the dance Carrie took me to at Smith College?—and that was something, that was healing, but it still wasn’t an answer. And at Fire &amp; Water, Nellie was convulsing on the table and saying, “I’m going to die tonight. That sucks. ” Tina was there, too, in town for a visit. We went to my old convenience store to get her pain reliever of some sort. I asked at the counter if anyone had quit or been fired this week, and the person said No, but Keep checking back, with a smile. (Nellie was better, soon, talking to someone outside about metaphysics. ) 3 It’s a white Thanksgiving, here, a wet-in-your-boots sort of covering of snow. 4 My days have consisted of job hunts by day and social excess by night. Tonight, the Fire &amp; Water Vegetarian Café/Performance Space closes down. The tables, counter, piano, and wall hangings have all been taken down. There are candles and free coffee and people speaking to each other. 5 Earlier this week, Jonny and I finally got together and finished up the recorded, full-band version of “Flight of the Angel”. The drum and bass parts for this song, “My Favorite Color is You”, “Every Catch Phrase”, “Extinguish to Vapor” and “The Password” were actually recorded months ago, but only now did we get around to building on them. 6 Men are supposed to try, Men are supposed to work, Men are judged on their efforts and on the success of their efforts. Women are judged more on how well they can serve as an escape from the effects of a man’s deterministic world: how supportive they can be, how well they can make things easier. I don’t see success vs. failure; I see destruction vs. non-destruction. Men are the ones who are expected to Do, who are expected to Change The World. They’re expected to invent things, they’re expected to become rock stars, they’re expected to do anything that requires determination and effort. Aggression, it’s figured, is sometimes necessary for this. Women? They’re supposed to wait. They’re supposed to receive things gracefully. They’ll be the waitresses, taking orders from customers. If they would prefer actual careers, well, they can be the social workers, because then it’s all about patience, it’s all about prudence. It’s not about action. I want to have the option of just letting things be when that’s the best choice to make. 7 My mother insisted that she needed more presents for me. My gift list had been short. So, she gave me a wad of bills and told me to buy things to put under the tree. This was almost more difficult for me than shopping for other people. 8 Christmas Eve. We’re the first to arrive. Some relatives. I don’t remember them. Second cousins? Or something. I recognize the names. And the basement looks familiar, but no, it’s just that many basements look like this. Pool table. Wall hangings, endorsing North American beers. I really don’t remember this portion of the family, then. A drink, perhaps? My mother mixes Kahlua and milk. I open the 2-liter bottle of Pepsi. Hey, I’m pretty stylin’. It’s the jacket, still. Don’t look at the back, it’s ripped. Four dollars at a California thrift shop, 1998. I’m in the bathroom when the others start to arrive. I recognize them, yes, I’ve known them for years. (Relatives, they call them. Relatives. ) I’m staring myself down in the mirror. Here’s my posture. I need clarity of presence, or I’ll just walk around, frantically, wishing that I could run. Ah, yes—here’s everybody. The house is filling up. All right, then. Time for me to leave and go to a nightclub instead. 9 Eventually (still Christmas Eve) I came home. Mom was playing Santa for her boyfriend Bruce’s daughter, Alyssa. I helped. It was over-beautiful. 10 Alyssa is a sweet child. Between opening her own presents, she kept wanting to find presents for others to open, too. 11 The temperature warms for New Year’s Eve. Fog is everywhere. I drive the creepiest route I possibly can to the party. I keep thinking that I would like for someone new to the area to be in the passenger’s seat so that I could share the experience. My friend Alyson’s date for the evening is a chocolate bug named Smiley Boog. I’ve brought beer. Bacardi. Pepsi. This picture on this tin is of dogs under a Christmas tree. The sticker explains that inside it is popcorn—butter, cheese, and caramel flavor. But they’re all dog flavored, too—of course! This can be inferred from the dogs on the tin! Ha ha! I am clever. Darnit, where’s the bottle opener? I’m not one of those cool kids who can do it with a lighter or keychain. I’m not much of a drinker, But c’mon, it’s a party, it’s New Year’s, I’m legal to consume as much as I want, this is a safe environment, I won’t need to flee the scene as an angry mob chases after me, knock on wood—and so I will have as much time as I need to sober up before driving. Okay, I’ve been here before. I’ll just check that drawer of miscellany. Yeah, that’s a functional bottle opener. When you’re little you don’t even realize, bottle openers are everywhere. Corkscrews are tougher to find. I’ve had to leave parties just to run to a corner store and buy a corkscrew, I trust no hack jobs when it comes to the opening of my wine. But I’ve brought no wine tonight. Wine is for romantic New Year’s festivities, and romance is what happens when a man and a woman love each other very very much and get married. The rest of us will drink beer and date Smiley Boogs. There is conversation. Hey! This guy just shaved his head! Let’s find a marker and write on his baldness! But no, this is just kidding. And anyway, he has access to special, super-permanent markers, and will write all over the face of anyone who dares such a thing. Alyson tells me that she’s sad only to have the Smiley Boog. It’s New Year’s Eve, she doesn’t have anyone, look at all these couples. I nod and try not to let on too much that I rarely notice couples anymore, that I only stay on guard for unchecked jealousy and go great lengths not to flirt with any strangers at all, because I am attracted to too many people but also hyper-conscious that bad can be a package deal with good like a computer bundle with a year’s subscription to the Microsoft Network, and because my attraction is a potent drug I only wait around in case I happen to be trapped in an elevator with someone someday so that we can blame God for our unwise affections, although sometimes I or another will not be able to resist sabotaging elevators so that we can be stuck in one together. My friend, I hope you don’t mind, the Smiley Boog of fluctuating gender now wants to be my date, too! The Smiley Boog will kiss us both as the televised ball drops. We will be sharing a drink they call loneliness, but it’s better than drinking alone. La la day day dah. I’m silly, and as always, once the year has changed, I find myself shocked by the change. The calendar year is different now? 2003? Gadzooks! I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m still drinking. Heck, it’s a party, so I’ve had many opportunities to talk, keeping my mouth busy. Each drink has been lasting me, and though I haven’t an outrageous tolerance it sometimes seems that I do, as most of my friends are shorter than I am and do not have my metabolism, which requests an absurd three full meals a day. Who eats three meals a day anymore? We’re in an economic recession; how will we buy our compact discs if we eat so much? The first parties involving alcohol I ever attended were in college. Cast parties, with lots of people running around singing songs and throwing their personae all over everybody else. I was all smiles at those parties. And although the silliness is at a lesser level here than at those cast parties, here’s a mellow room where a bunch of people are haphazardly sprawled out across the floor, some of them cuddling, some of them chatting, people comforting a friend, and I smile at this effect of partying. Elsewhere in the room, another plays with a candle. I could pretend that I’m closely watching these folks as they hug and say nice things to each other only because I’ve been drinking, but the truth is that I want everybody to be an “I love you” drunk all the time, so I take it in all that I can and maybe someday I’ll be able to express my worries and heartache to the people who care for me, and it will be beautiful and sappy and good. Then there’s the guy who’s not having a good time, he doesn’t like parties, but he’s happy if we talk to him. Of course I know what that’s like, I certainly do, let me tell you how strongly I relate, but I realize, as I’m saying these things, that I’m saying it brightly, in an outgoing fashion. I’m at a party, I can look anyone in the eye, it’s no big deal, I always get enough hugs, and I can pick and choose, even, who will keep me warm, and if desperate need for human contact will turn some of us into creeps can these among us really be blamed if they’ve been shaking alone in the night and don’t know where to begin, because their desperation keeps others away? It happens sometimes, though we can’t conceive of the things which push some of us into these places, and so really, if we’re going to speak about strength, take a look at the strength of the lonely who don’t become creeps, who aren’t looking to prey on the weak. But I think that things are settling down, so I’ll give people hugs goodbye and make my way home. Happy 2003! 12 I’d better be careful. The car could slide on the ice. You can’t fuck around when there’s a mountain between you and your destination. I’m worried that I’m driving too slowly. There are two cars behind me. I’m too young to drive this slowly. I’m wild and crazy, my friends belong to subcultures! I’ve traveled the country! But no, safety first. It’s still a little surreal, this gothic/industrial night at a coffee shop business. (Ugh, parking is annoying in the snow. There are plenty of on-street spots in this town, but I miss the feeling of security offered by those little white brackets demarcating the spots. ) Yup. Folks with their faces painted for the evening, no dancing going on but there’s the DJ onstage with his equipment, and the soundtrack blares and it wouldn’t be the same otherwise. This coffee shop has special drinks, designed for the night. I order a “depresso”. An unhappy face is drawn on the top in chocolate syrup. Fuller makes a naked snow angel in the alleyway. In exchange, someone is buying him a cup of coffee. “Good times! It’s great to be young,” I say. It can be a tiny triumph to feel the sting of a pain which comes from no enemy, I think, and silently I’m reading an astrologer’s advice for my sign, the newspaper is in my hands. I’m searching for a drug store. I’m not going to buy anything, though. I’m going to apply for employment. I’m pathetic. My father emails me every day. He tells me to go to college. I use the artificial heat in the car, defrosting the window. There’s no frost, just that fogging effect, just a little. I turn off the heat once I’m satisfied that I’m safe. I drive with one hand on the steering wheel and nod my head along to the percussive rhythm of a compact disc playing through the stereo system. The drums are well-recorded. I hear the illusion of depth in these sounds. There is none of the tape hiss that one would have heard in music of the twentieth century. During the mixing process each recorded track of this song was panned and EQd. Multiple vocal parts were recorded, although some are only vaguely noticeable and are not intended to be noticed, as they only fill in the gaps of a sonic wall. I took a wrong turn. I need to pee. I’m supposed to be in Ludlow. I’m in Wilbraham. I will be careful as I pull into the Friendly’s parking lot. I’m driving on ice. I pay little attention to the hostess, because I still have to pee. I notice my waitress, though, who seems friendly. I smile, saying, I’ll just have a water for now, where’s the restroom? I eat ice cream. I’m already full. My tummy hurts. I am afraid that I might explode or something. I’m rarely afraid that something might be wrong with me. Maybe I should be more worried about the little pains I feel. Or, maybe I myself am a hypochondriac, and I’m just not sick often. I mean, c’mon—”That I might explode”? I am a meta-hypochondriac! I should be on television. The two teenage girls at the table next to me appear to be sad. Yeah, they’re laughing with friends and making references to programs on MTV, whose titles and concepts are familiar to me though I have not seen the programs myself. But, they don’t really like each other. They’re afraid that they won’t find anyone better to befriend. They don’t think they’re pretty. I can tell. I am older. I have a book displayed loudly next to a cup of coffee. I’m not hiding the cover tonight, as I sometimes do when I don’t want anyone to know what I’m reading—and a pad of paper on which I scribble, and my face bears a little stubble, and I nod to the waitress whenever she comes around. Look at me, I am alone, I am alone in a nearby but unfamiliar town. I am an idiot. I just needed to pee. I’m spending too long here. The drug store in Ludlow is closed. 13 Mar. 21, 2003. The Thirsty Mind, South Hadley, Massachusetts. In addition to my standard cup of medium coffee, light with sugar, I am ingesting water, no ice, from a plastic cup (transparent) while somewhere between the morning and afternoon I initiate a new paperjournal. I regret that I have not taken more consistent an approach to journal-keeping, and the advent of a new, disconcerting war… there’s an excuse for me to write. Thoughts from this period of American life for future peoples. About one month short of my twenty-second birthday, and mostly sentence fragments in my head, clauses like clouds which split until barely visible, a haze, a subtle alteration of hue. I am welcoming Spring as best I know how, abandoning my jacket and skipping wherever I go, and skipping in the sun. Tuesday night, and as always, Haven. After, Denny’s, where I sat and listened to someone I don’t know well but who graciously inspected my car once, when it refused to start, as she spoke for a good half hour about the impending situation in Iraq—slated to begin, we all knew, the following day. Home and to sleep and the next day, a letter from Hampshire College. My body tensed. I opened it quickly, but it was neither to accept nor to decline my application for undergraduate study, rather to notify me that certain documents had not been received by their Admissions office. To my high school for transcripts, at the very time when classes were being dismissed for the day. I remembered the inhuman sounds of these children, and it was a feeling both of accomplishment and of sadness that I knew I was now immune to the soul-crushing weight of a city’s public school culture, while I walked against the traffic, into the main entranceway and then to the office. A drive then to Holyoke Community College, where I composed a note and left it in Tom’s till: Hampshire claims not to have received your letter, here’s my number if you need to contact me, et cetera. Lightly, it began to rain on this otherwise beautiful day. It was a warm rain, and in fact was quite satisfying to feel. I drove to the town of Ware, which is at the very eastern edge of this Pioneer Valley, to see a coffee shop that was holding an open mic night. As I had suspected, it was small, with a mostly middle-aged demographic of customers. The employee was also a justice of the peace, who arranged details of several upcoming marriage ceremonies. I read from The Bell Jar and left before the open mic started. It was late to search for employment. What more was to be done? I somehow forgot that I was overdue for sleep, having awoken at such an odd time, and so I drove to Easthampton, where Capo’s Coffee Café was holding Avalon, the goth night. Kilean stood onstage behind DJ equipment with headphones over one ear, as usual, and Fuller was playing Go with someone I didn’t recognize. I was socially inaccessible, for the most part, and this certainly had something to do with the fact that I was by now almost finished with my reading of The Bell Jar. Today I awoke and decided that what appears to be a newfound joblessness on my part is what I’d best seek to change. The situation is like this: a week ago today I arrived at the usual meet spot, a restaurant in West Springfield, for a scheduled job at the inventory service. After twenty-five minutes no one had arrived, so I left. I’ve heard nothing from the company since then, and I don’t have the number for the office (which is in Albany, New York). I had been hoping to find a different job, since I wasn’t being given enough hours there, but it still would have been better to have kept that gig until something better comes along. I lose employment a lot, but experience has taught me that I’m not skilled at deducing the reasons behind this. Wow. Look at the way the sun’s light reflects from that roof’s tiling. That’s fabulous. 14 Outside of the Northampton Brewery, Northampton, Massachusetts. Spring air, a bright sun, and droplets of sweat from my forehead. Smoking a cigarette and playing with pebbles. I realized, yesterday, that I lacked the telephone numbers I would have needed in order to apply to new positions. Irresponsibility got the better of me and so with my guitar I traveled to Northampton, where in Pulaski Park I could play a concert to myself and to innocent bystanders. The outside air was a perfect room temperature. Confidently I gathered myself together, getting into practice with new songs and with songs I hadn’t played in some time. After this I only had to walk for a day to take form. This is the benefit as well as the cost of knowing the people I do in this town. A figure waves to me from across the street, and only upon my crossing can I see that it’s Smarf, a local I know from… where do I know Smarf from? With someone else whose name I forgot. Then Jonny presented himself to me, which is a thing he does sometimes—sets himself in the center of the sidewalk, opens his arms into a pose, and waits for a reaction. We walked around for a few hours, then he headed home, and then I ran into Zella, who invited me to hang out with her at Tina’s. Alcohol was procured, and Tina was going to bed early, so I was invited to join Zella and Amelia at Zella’s place for a DtE party (decoding the essence). Mostly the three of us just hung out, but we kept it mellow, lay down or zoned out if we had to, and tried to make sense of our narratives (to the extent that we could decode them in such a noisy context). At one point after we’d been doing that for a while, Amelia left for the living room while Zella and I lay in Zella’s bed, and for an extended length of time Zella monologued about wanting to kiss me but not being able to pick up any signs about how I would react. We had kissed briefly, at her request, during a night of drinking, once. Her interest in me had been made clear, she had repeatedly stated that someday, in some way, she wants to have sex with me. I’m not much interested in this idea. Partially because she has just never intrigued me in that way and partially because I have a pride within me that makes me wish to be something other than just a Boy. What I want from people, then? I want to be both fickle friend and unconditional lover to someone… and I want to give commentary on all drafts of conspiracies against me, then play my role with a knowing wink instead of through a façade of secrecy. Once she stopped making the question be whether or not I wanted to kiss her, I was able to say that I wouldn’t react harshly if she kissed me. So, there was some kissing. "

    "body": "15 The Daily Hampshire Gazette headline reads: “Baghdad Lit Up”, and all I can think of is the Buckcherry song, the singer jumping up and down onstage in the music video. Does Baghdad love the cocaine? Is that what the Gazette is trying to imply? Oh, right. We’re talking about bombs over Baghdad, and that’s a song from a whole other genre. Mandy IMd and suggested that we get together, since she only has a week left in the Pioneer Valley. And just as I left to meet her in Amherst I checked the mail and found a manila envelope from my father, which included a printout from the 1900’s tracing back the genealogy of my great-grandfather to a guy in France around 1700. I didn’t have much time to spend deciphering the text-only, French language document, but I still found myself intrigued, and still began to think, really think, about how things change. Stuck behind slow-moving vehicles through the small towns between Chicopee and Amherst. Listening to The Smashing Pumpkins and wishing there were some better way of preserving the music I’ve loved to make it last and hand it down. Bruce a couple of days before had fixed the speakers of the car stereo but in the process accidentally disconnected my turn signals, so now I need to drive not only defensively (as usual) but also apologetically, ashamed of my unsafe vehicle. I arrived at Newbury Comics, passed an indie girl and a guy in a mohawk and kept walking until I saw Mandy, who was in the back, where the store carries books but only hip ones, pop counterculture and subculture like Robert Anton Wilson or Douglas Rushkoff or any shiny book with pretty pictures about the gothic movement. She and I walk and grab some tea while speaking about people we know, although I steer the conversation away from gossip and more toward how the changing face of her life has affected her perspective. I’m curious about the shape of her head since she cut ties from me (for a while) and fell in with somewhat of a new crowd. Back to her place, her friend Rebecca T. calls to make some plans with her, then gets me on the phone to scribble down the names of our Senators onto a matchbook. Call, says Rebecca to the both of us, so that we can state our opposition to the war. Three messages from Graff and Zella when I get home, but I call and they’re gone, so I sleep. Now in the morning I break sequence (no, afternoon) again in this writing because my mind, it gets like this sometimes and I want to know everything, but all I can do is write. And so there is that genealogy chart. Jo (who is part of the somewhat new crowd Mandy has fallen in with) posted on LiveJournal about the anti-war protest in Chicopee, the city where I grew up and the location of an Air Force Reserve Base. Jo wrote of a terrible feeling she had, while the locals screamed at her to “go back to Northampton”, although she amended her signs to be more respectful of the troops overseas who here are the family members of the people living simple working-class lives… “This town is so pro-war,” she wrote, “These people just want to send their children to colleges and pay mortgages. ” And I look at that genealogical chart, the French and Indian War brought my ancestor to Montreal, and each line showed that these persons married and had children, and their children married and had more children. And me, I have compromised stability to practice untested lifestyles. I was okay until the Internet came along, says my mother, but until the Internet I simply wanted to die, and the Internet taught me to run before they catch you, to always keep running. “Why does your heart beat so fast?” asked Zella the other night, and I told her that I didn’t know. 16 Today I met Lisa, a gal who responded to my online personal on the Nerve dating site. I visited her at the grocery store she works at. She invited me to meet up with her and her friend here at the Hampshire Mall, where they’ll be coming to play some Dance Dance Revolution. A girl whose name I’ve forgotten ran up to me as soon as I arrived, hugged me, and told me that Harvey was in the arcade. Harvey had blue hair, was wearing heavy makeup, and was wearing a skirt. He looked sad. He said he was leaving town soon. 17 Lisa and Danny were sitting at a table. They had already played their games of Dance Dance Revolution—at the cinemaplex’s arcade, it turns out, not at the freestanding arcade where I was looking for them. I sat at their table, with my feet up on the seat (Lisa was sitting similarly). “We were talking about the Geneva Convention,” Lisa said. We went into the arcade so that I could play some DDR, too. Danny vanished. It was unclear whether Lisa requested this or if he decided to wander on his own. I remember having played DDR twice—once with Whitehouse, which had been the first time for both of us, and once in June’s dorm, on the home version. I found myself growing tired quite easily, but I still had fun. She suggested that we sit outside. We were somewhat hidden against a wall. I commented that this was the first time this year that a cool breeze had felt refreshing to me. The sky was clear. I could see several stars. I had felt awkward during my time standing around her at the grocery store. I had gazed thoughtlessly into the displays of chocolate while she had used a push-broom. Now, though, sitting comfortably outside in the evening hours, I removed my blazer, wiped the traces of sweat from my brow, smiled, looked over to her, her hair was up into two little buns, those glasses which she’d said looked dorky were actually rather cute, but whatever, you know? Whatever, and she laughed at my jokes, such a good way to put someone at ease. Danny came by. “Introduce yourself, he’s shy,” Lisa whispered. I did. He stuck around for all of two minutes before wandering off. I asked why he wouldn’t just stick around. She turned these questions of mine into little jokes and brushed them off. I still felt uncomfortable, being the boy for whom a friend gets ignored. I used my question, “What’s the meaning of life?” It’s unexpected and can be taken either humorously or seriously. But, I used the trick of asking it multiple times, to see if I’ll get different answers after some repetition. The first time I did this was with Scientist Jen, that night when we kisses on the roof of Fire &amp; Water before I left for Portland. Lisa’s responses to the questions were, “Sex”, “Sex”, and “Sex”. Poking was used a boundary-testing device. Then she asked whether she could use me for body heat. I said yes. She nibbled my arm, then my face, as we snuggled, outside, watching the passersby and speculating about them. Eventually Danny returned. He had been sitting in the car for a half hour. I hugged Lisa goodbye. I re-entered the mall. Harvey was still there, sitting at a table and sketching. I told him about Lisa as we had a smoke. “She said that she was thinking of dying her hair blue. I told her I had seen someone I hadn’t seen in awhile, and that he’d dyed his hair blue. She said it had probably been the same guy she’d thought was cute. I asked if he’d been wearing a skirt, she said yes. ” When I described her, he exclaimed, “That girl?! Give her my email address! I was checking her out!” Nah. Sorry, Harvey. So, then he and I went to The Ground Round to drink some wine. Erik was there—he’s working there now. Erik never seems to look at me when he’s talking to someone I’m with. I forget how, and when, I first met him. Harvey and I at the bar, he has the cheap wine, I have the pricier wine, he talks about how he’s been listening to Bill O’Reilly and I say things like, “I’m glad for the anti-war resistance no matter what the basis for argument is, because now there’s this pressure for a rebuilding of Iraq after everything goes down, and I wish we could have done that with Afghanistan” and he says things like, “Yes, but with Afghanistan there’s not much we could do” and that he’s less punk these days and more goth because he finally has money and that he’s doing new comics. 18 Tuesday night, I pulled out the dress I got from Uncle Margaret’s. I needed tights to wear under it. I had never worn tights before. Hot Topic would help me out with this, I figured. I had never purchased anything from Hot Topic before, but I figured their selection would be easy to make sense of, appropriate for the club, and accommodating of someone over six feet tall who needed something to wear under a black and purple dress with sequins. The only black tights which were not fishnet or some approximation thereof were thigh-highs with a little bow at the top, which would have been a bit much for me. So I settled on purple stripey ones, although really I’m not a fan of those stripey tights. In addition, I wore some eyeshadow Zella had left in my car a while back, plus some good ol’ Cover Girl coverup. The dress looked pretty good, I thought, except for the tights, but whatever. When someone asked me what inspired me to dress in such a fashion this evening I said, “When you hear as often as I do that people think you take yourself too seriously, every once in awhile you have to do something that will…” “Prove them wrong?” the person asked. I shook my head: “Probably more just confuse them for a while. ” I sat at a table with Graff and Val when a guy from Connecticut came by, promoting his tattoo business. He brought us a round of expensive shots. Shirles approached. I hadn’t seen her for a while, and as usual we snuggled closely, then she disappeared and I didn’t see her again for the rest of the night. June was there, and she wore those thigh-highs (with the bow) from Hot Topic I had seen earlier in the night. The words she spoke were as saturated with self-deprecating asides as ever, but aside from this it was fabulous to talk with her. I remember there was some conversation about the nature of belief, y’know. Deep stuff. Holding hands with Jill, who is almost twenty-one now? I still thought of her as eighteen, like when I met her. It hasn’t been that long, what are you doing to me, Time? 19 I met Lisa at the Belchertown Common. She wore sunglasses with her hair back and she said something about how she hated makeup and mirrors and I realized that the first time I met her I had mistaken her complete lack of makeup for a really good makeup job. What can we do, now, but walk to the bank? She was confident, while I was just clever. I was experienced, I know, yes, but when she spoke about being kinky it was all really kink to her, whereas one can tie me up, invite their friends, and we can defy convention for hours non-stop and there is no normalcy around for it to be contrasted against. Maybe I’m lost, maybe I’ve used my privilege to escape from tradition, to explore, to chase frontiers, and maybe I can never go back. “Oh, good, home mortgage loans!” I enthused, reading pamphlets at the County Bank. She smiled and got into line and I remembered, she really didn’t know anything about me yet. 20 Amherst, Massachusetts. I perch on the bench. Man on the street corner had a sign: “Support Our Troops”. Now, two guys on the bench next to me discuss the concept. The implication of this catch phrase, presumably, is “…and shut up”, although I prefer, “…and exercise the liberty for which they supposedly fight. ” Kid in a camo jacket, peace symbol on the back, “We have guided missiles and misguided men -Martin Luther King, Jr. ” I still haven’t been to a single protest, for numerous reasons not having to do with my beliefs on the matter. And I will still think about yesterday, about Lisa: “I’ll go wherever you drive me,” she said, so I drove her here, to the center of Amherst. I was still more a visitor to her ways than she was to mine. We spent a while in a store, where we poked at stuffed animals and I examined a road map of Tibet. We lay in the grass on the common, then, and I heard some of her high school tales, y’know. Everyone with whom she has consensually had sex, she says, were virgins. “I’ve never been with a virgin,” I said, as though it meant something. Back to Belchertown, there to the backseat of her car as it began to rain. Pillows and a blanket, back there, I was invited to lie on her, nuzzling her, playing with her sweater. She caressed my hair, et cetera, and I practiced my nibbling. You see, she’s more a nibbler than a biter, and I’m used to biters. She nibbled my face and I nibbled back. There were some kisses, but I asked her, “What are your intentions with me?” like a father talking to his daughter’s potential suitor, and she replied, “More nibbling, probably,” and left it at that. Time passed by and the windows fogged. I looked her in the eyes. “What?” she asked. “I just wanted to look in your eyes. ” (Journal entry postponed on account of an anti-war march presently in the road in front of me. ) 21 Police cars clear the way for the protesters. Others direct traffic. “What do we want?” “Peace!” “When do we want it?” “Now!”—the strange way call-and-response works with both numerous callers and numerous responders. They walk to the main intersection, then back. Back to UMass, is my guess. I play it cool. I don’t walk with them. I just take it in. A little girl in a Radio Flyer with a “No War” sign. She looks at me, smiling. I smile back. Are they sticking around at that intersection there? I still hear them, see them. Okay, I’m going in. 22 But let’s go back to where I was, hanging out with Lisa. As I began to mention in my earlier entry, I told her that I wanted to look into her eyes. “I think touch can communicate more than what you’ll find in there,” she said. Of course I wasn’t, you know, falling in love with her or anything near so intense. It just made me… a little too happy. Her eyes were a light brown, but it was the whites of them that spoke, somehow, as her vision would fixate on something specific and seize it, follow it… A quick drive to pick up Danny, and then in the mall, a game of DDR for us, it was Danny’s request and Lisa rode with me, “Oh, can’t we just stay in the car and have sex?” and I smiled and said, “Uh, just get out of the car, you. ” Then to her home. I met her aunt, and the dog. We snuggled some more, briefly, and played the home version of DDR. “So will you invite me into your world, now that you’ve seen mine?” as we were hugging, standing up. “Yes,” I said. Danny tired himself out with DDR and lay on the floor to recover. Lisa walked me out. The embrace goodbye: “So, you were saying, next time, I can… what was it? Show you my world?” A beat.  “We’ll talk later. ” But a kiss goodbye. 23 I woke up late, apparently having turned off my alarm without realizing it. This was frustrating. I had scheduled an appointment for STI testing, but now it would have to be rescheduled. I called and took care of that, then went to The Thirsty Mind for the purpose of writing. I left my contact info at the Hampshire College Admission Office, then, requesting that they let me know whether all the materials my application requires have yet been received. And to Amherst center, just for the purpose of continued journal-writing… which was when the protest came along. I surveyed it. I had seen small gatherings of persons rallying for causes before, of course, especially in Amherst, but this was the first actual march I had seen. People hitting snare drums. Ethan, the guy who had befriended me after seeing the play I wrote and directed because he had wanted for me to help fire an artistic revolution, was there. He waved to me with the hand not holding a protest sign. That was the point when this march, in my mind, changed from kinda cool and worth a smile… to a surreal entity—Protest—that this generation has brought back to life like some kind of Frankenstein’s monster, using remains of previous incarnations and also whatever else was lying around. “Show me what democracy looks like!” “This is what democracy looks like!” I liked that one, after I had gotten past the thought, “Democracy is a bunch of college students?” There were nay-sayers, you could tell who they were, they stood with serious faces, cussing—”Tell them to get the fuck out of the street!” Though the conversations I overheard about “Supporting Our Troops”—it was always Support Our Troops, and always capitalized—were respectable, for what they were… generally, the Support Our Troops people were older types, who knew more about war than most of the folks in the protest. For these people, this was just another war, and so just another wartime… …but what of Liberty? These were young Americans wanting to ensure that they wouldn’t be silenced. Isn’t that respectable? I had been reading. I had been thinking. I had been feeling. I had been watching America fall farther. Whatever. I’d support the drive to change. I’d support challenge against authority. Yeah. I’d Support Our Troops. 24 Nighttime, cigarette on porch. I shouldn’t, I do, there’s an ashtray, want to smoke and write, feeling pulled toward another gathering, another session of hanging out, but hell, I stopped writing midway through my account of the protest… and there’s much on my mind. So, the protest group was in Amherst Center when I joined them. I walked with them for a bit without saying anything. I’m not one whose demeanor easily allows him to join a crowd (enough of a history of being singled out and told you are different from the rest will do that to a person) but slowly, so slowly I had come to the conclusion that this type of congregation was needed. I must have seemed like such a solemn face among the college students and hippies, and when I finally began to join in the chants I did so feeling a little ashamed but also relieved. I do at moments let myself go to the point of celebration. I know that I flashed peace signs without ironic intent for the first time in my life. It seemed like few were paying attention to the direction in which we marched, and I wasn’t worrying about that either. I was following the drum… “1,2,3,4, we don’t want your racist war! 5,6,7,8, we will not cooperate!”—though, I tended not to join in on the “No blood for oil!” chant. That seemed to simplify the politics of the whole thing, a bit too much for my tastes. "

Letting the creativity or whatever it is build in my head, so everything I see, I see against a background of this, this ART, ART… …and I don’t know what drew me so fully into this silly sort of life, but I don’t know that I would trade it for anything else. There are times when I feel, honestly, as lucky a human as I could possibly have been. Thursday’s protest moved west down route 9 from Amherst into Hadley. We split off, interrupting both lanes of traffic. The majority of motorists seemed at least not to mind, when they weren’t downright supportive, living in this area as they do, and Ethan came up to me and said, “I’m glad you could join us. ” He looked validated now that he had a cause he could immediately get behind. Jo skipped formalities upon seeing me, and said, “So I’m kind of unclear on this. I understand the whole thing about, not writing about the war in LiveJournal, but I couldn’t really tell from what I read what your stance was… so you’re against the war?” I looked to the ground while I responded, “Yes. ” I didn’t feel proud of my opinion. I wasn’t excited to be part of a movement. It wasn’t that I liked to protest… She started to say something that involved the words “ethical imperative” before asking that I hold her protest signs while she ran to say something else to someone else. I supposed that I did feel a certain obligation to myself to do this, but it also didn’t seem different than anything I would do on impulse. Human nature was so bizarre. We organized impulses in our brain until they led us to perform an action, then we felt the need to explain our methods after the fact. We were nearing the Hampshire Mall. What was going on? Jo made me feel outwardly nervous and fragile but inwardly secure and validated. The crowd gathered at an intersection, Jo coming back, now asking for me to hold her purse. The sky was partly cloudy while we gathered in a circle. Wow, imagine the redirection of the drivers on this road, I thought, because I couldn’t imagine to where they had been redirected. Jo mumbled: “What, now, is it time for us to hold hands? Y’know, sometimes I get sick of being involved with a peace movement that’s made up of so many hippies. ” Then a guy with a megaphone: “There’s a recruitment center in the mall!” and I looked around me to see if taking an anti-war march into a shopping mall seemed ridiculous to anyone else. If so, no one was any more vocal in their skepticism than I was, and all I did was give a borrowed protest sign back to Jo. “Was my sign not good enough for you, Levi Adams?” “No, it’s just… they may be our streets, but it’s not our mall. I’m just going in the other entrance and using a restroom. I’m not going to march through fucking J. C. Penney. ” Because march through J. C. Penney they did, before gathering outside of the very closed Armed Services recruitment center. The sound of chants echoed strongly past the stores, and sales associates stood outside most storefronts, watching in the direction of the protest, appearing confused. I bought some juice and used the men’s room. Much of the crowd now waited at the bus stop outside (having quickly been dispersed from the mall) while others marched in the direction of (I kid you not) the Wal-Mart across the street… …where, I would later hear, the obligatory arrests finally happened, because they lay down in the aisles there, and I thought to myself when I heard that, We’re protesting against a war, not against capitalism! The sun was setting as I rode back to Amherst on the bus. I returned to my car and drove west, taking the route I had just marched, and I found myself caught in the small group of demonstrators who remained, as they walked back into Amherst, still in the street. I gave thumbs up and smiled. Into Northampton, since I was in the area. Maurice came and sat with me while I drank coffee at Haymarket. We stopped at Bart’s, then, and chatted with his co-worker, Erik. Maurice, out of boredom, agreed to join me in a trip to Capo’s for Avalon. I had some conversation with people, read from Rolling Stone and wrote in my journal. Then I dropped him off, went online, was invited by Zella to meet up with her at Tina’s to watch a movie. So it went. Graff was also there, and a boy of Tina’s. We watched Four Rooms. Then to Graff’s, where he, Zella, and I shared the bed. “You have no idea how much this turns me on,” squealed Zella, in the middle of us, before we fell asleep. (Zella is all about Graff, these days. ) We ate at Kathy’s Diner in the morning (afternoon?) then I said hello to Maurice at work and dropped off a work application with him. That night (Friday), talked to Alice online, she invited me over, we drank coffee and smoked cigarettes. She filled me in on the story of what’s been going on with her. I wore some sunglasses that lay on the table, so that I could feel like a rock star. Some talk with Alice’s mom about international politics: her boyfriend is in Turkey, so she was putting time into reading the news from the Internet while Alice and I continued our conversation. Some watching of Conan O’Brien followed, until it was time for me to leave. I had arranged to meet up with Lisa the following afternoon. I awoke a bit late and so called to postpone our meet time by a couple hours. I wanted to pretty myself up, I hadn’t shaved in a couple days and I didn’t want to meet someone so cuddly without shaving first. When I arrived, Lisa was playing chess with Danny. When he took her queen, she forfeited by putting herself into check (although you’re not supposed to be able to do that). I had hoped to show her a time that was more Levi-like in nature, but instead we watched a movie (Ringu, the Japanese film after which the American The Ring was patterned) on her bed while Danny was on the floor. Tickling, nibbling, throughout the entire duration of the movie. The food at Friendly’s. Then back to her place, some DDR, Danny getting depressed and going upstairs and my feeling strange, like here was a big curtain between me and the realities of Lisa’s life, but hey, hey, hey, all along I kept telling myself that this was low-pressure anyway, yeah, nothing serious, just hanging out like normal people do (only with more nibbling). I knew that a Boston protest had been scheduled for this day. I felt strangely regretful for having not gone due to these pre-arranged plans… but I had never arranged a method by which I could have made it there. “I’ve done a lot of thinking about it,” I had told Jo, “And I’ve come to the conclusion that we need protests. ” “Yeah, but for what, is the question,” she’d responded, and I’m really so terrible with discussions of politics, most of the time… Where was I? I’m filling you in on so much tonight, Paper. Okay. The chronology is up to last night, that being Saturday, the 29th of March. I drove home from Lisa’s, but again I was not to be home for long. (Standing outside, thoughts running wild now, too much coffee, too much coffee AAARGH) I was invited over to Zella’s house. Graff was there, along with Edna, a friend of his. I arrived and they had just begun to watch Vanilla Sky. I read Strangers in Paradise books until that was over with, because I wasn’t in the mood. Then we watched 8 Mile, and that I watched. I liked it. It was like Rocky, but with freestyle rap. Zella, after, said something like, “I’d love to do that. Some day, you guys, I’m going to be this dope rapper. ” And I said, “I’d love to see that, and I think that’d be fantastic, but I know it’s not going to happen. ” “Yes, it’s going to happen. ” “Prove me the fuck wrong, then. ” “I will prove you the fuck wrong. ” “Prove me the fuck wrong, and I’ll produce your shit. ” We shook on it. We drove to Graff’s, but before settling in it was agreed that we would go to the pond at Smith College. It was a still and quiet night. We all were kind of in our own zones, watching the trees, the night, moving confidently, like we were all performing for cameras somewhere, 4 AM, and four of us out and about, I guess I really do hang out with goths, and I was so happy, and flashing back and forth through impressions and recollections, and tree branches reaching for each other while the first colors of an approaching sun call out to me, nature is like walking into someone else’s heaven to me. (And Graff’s bed the other night, Zella whispering, “I have a question… do you really have a pentacle on your chest?” and I kind of laughed, “Well, I showed you what it looks like”—my chest hair can vaguely be argued to resemble a five-pointed star—and she said, “Okay, because we were drunk at the time, and I wondered. ”) 5 AM and Zella runs off to cry alone without saying a word, my gut response is to follow, interrupting Graff mid-sentence, “I don’t want to stay here while she walks away” and she said, “I don’t like for other people to see me cry” and I said, “You can ask me to go back if you’d prefer that” but she didn’t and I just sat next to her, until Graff and his friend approached. “Do you want me to distract them?” I whispered to Zella. She replied in the affirmative, and, to be blatant, I skipped up to the approaching pair and said, “Hi, I’m Levi! Look at me!” while blocking their path, which worked for a bit, but then Zella wanted more time alone, and we all sort of wandered in our own separate directions for a bit. Edna went home, and so it was me and Zella and Graff in a bed again. We awoke in the afternoon and sat for hours at the kitchen table. None of us knew the time, then, and it rained gently and we drank coffee and the sage had kept making me sneeze while I sat next to the bucket of candy (“left for the Chaos Fairies”, said Graff) and we talked about taking Ouija boards and travel and educational financial aid and I wish I could somehow capture, for future generations to see, the crazy tragic triumph of some of us, of the compulsions that drive us mad, the compassion that soothes us again, the way we have nothing and everything in common while we face such a hazy and uncertain future. Days like this might slip away, I want to be here, I want to know, I want to doubt. 26 Tapestry Health Systems. Northampton, Massachusetts. Waiting for STI testing. I have had very little experience, historically, with doctors. I anticipate moderate trauma, but so it goes. That girl said hello to me earlier, but I can’t recognize her. Perhaps she was just being friendly. I got fun pamphlets of information. Still waking up, eyes not completely open. Scribbling nervously. They’ll only contact you if there’s a problem. Isn’t that kind of mean? I had a tough time answering the personal questions, number of sexual partners and all that. What’s a “sexual partner”? 27 Hampshire College has received everything except my teacher’s recommendation. I’ll have to try tracking down Tom from HCC to see what happened. I happened to see Nellie in Northampton. “I’m using shock and awe as my tactic to get a job,” I said, “I’m just dropping off as many applications as I can, not being discriminating at all. ” “That’s it,” she said, “You have to give chaos the chance to work for you. ” She’s right. That’s exactly what I’m doing. Now I’m on the sidewalk, strange lady telling me how the weather’s gonna be, and my pen is running out, guess I’ll drop off the last application and head home, maybe sing some songs, maybe write some words. 28 Okay, so I didn’t make it out of Northampton like I planned.  I walked by Jo and Rebecca T. on the way to my car: “Hello”; “Hello”, and my continuing to walk, but then, “Oh, so you don’t stop to talk,” Jo likes to wear hats and her face tends to be obscured. I backtrack and squat next to them, they’re at a storefront, “Well, I didn’t know what was socially appropriate,” I said, but Jo retorted, “Oh, and like I’m so socially appropriate. ” “Well, everyone has their own standards…” Jo invited, “Do you want to come with us, get some boxed wine and go visit lesbians at Smith?” “That sounds fabulous,” I say. “But wait,” she adds, “I’m not supposed to be hanging out with you.  Just don’t tell Mandy. ” So we walked toward the nearest liquor store. I was the designated buyer, because my identification was better than Jo’s, I was told. And, “Since you’re a big, straight man, would you carry the wine?” I replied, “I will, but not because I’m a big, straight man. ” Rebecca: “Are you straight?” Me: “Well, you should ask Jo. She’s the expert. ” Then Jo pressured me to talk about my sexual orientation. I began to ramble, y’know, so then: “Do you only sleep with girls?” I respond that “No,” I don’t only sleep with girls, and I say that I just haven’t managed to come up with a definition of my orientation that would be both accurate and political. To the Northampton Lodging and Jo’s efficiency apartment, Smiths poster, “I’ll be post-feminist in the post-patriarchy” sticker on the wall, lots and lots of books, large bookshelf plus a box of books she’s looking to sell, I Was a Teenage Dominatrix and Nietzsche and Camus, The Fates are Not Forever and Six Dimensions of Labia, beat poets, lots of memoirs. Clothes across the floor, tampons (including used ones, I’m told, although I don’t see those), both male and female condoms. Jo needs to be sure she has enough safer sex supplies on her; she had to rummage to find dams. On the way to Smith, Jo asked, “Levi, will you carry my bag? It’s bothering me. ” And I said, “Eh, I’m already carrying the wine,” to which she replied, “Ooo! A straight boy with a spine. Or maybe he just doesn’t want to sleep with me. Which would be refreshing. ” “We’ll just have to wait and see,” I said. “I wouldn’t sleep with you. Mandy would throw a fit. ” At Smith College: “Have I met you before?” asked one of the girls. “Do you go to Haven?” asked the other. “Levi has dyke envy,” said Jo, apparently repeating gossip that was going around about me, “And I told him he has to accept that he benefits from straight white male privilege before he can start to act under the pretense that he’s a girl. I don’t know if you guys have any other advice to add. ” “Listen to the Indigo Girls,” one of them said. (Oh, and soon as we got to the dorm room, Jo took off her shirt for some reason. ) Watching I Love the ’80s on VH1. Jo snorted something while updating LiveJournal. I played with the paintbrush on the floor. Cigarette break with Rebecca, outside, talking about Liz Phair. Rebecca left to catch a bus. Jo said, “Do you still have Siamese Dream in your car? Because, if so, I think I want to be in there. ” And she kept apologizing for the time it was taking her to type up her entries, while the actual residents of this dorm room had left to go elsewhere and study, and an unplugged television was in the middle of the floor, and the singing of The Miracles’ “You’ve Really Got a Hold On Me”, first between Rebecca and Jo, then by Jo alone as she played MP3s of that, a Smiths song, and “You Don’t Own Me” several times each during the night. 29 “Sorry I’m word salad right now,” Jo had said on our walk to Smith. “Word salad?” I had repeated, not sure that I had heard exactly. “Yeah, that’s the term for language schizophrenics will speak in, with none of the usual connections between what’s said. ” “Well, I don’t mind. You don’t always need grammar or syntax. ” “Well, it’s not grammar or syntax so much as it’s, it doesn’t involve the usual causality. ” “I don’t want you/ But I need you,” Jo kept singing. Then, “Sorry, I’ll be done soon, once I’m finished typing these entries” into LiveJournal. I was hanging out with Jo. That was novel. And… I was going to drive her to some man’s hotel room? I didn’t want to, though. Jo was stumbling. It was a long walk to the car. She wanted a ride somewhere I hadn’t agreed to drive her. She was, like, pretty far gone. She had just extolled the virtues of responsible usage of substances, inside. Now she was calling me “babe”. “Don’t tell Mandy that I held your arm. ” I exhaled from my cigarette and didn’t really look at her, just looking around at the now-empty town. I said that we should stop in the 7-11 so she’d be able to buy a water—she could use it. An officer of the law was in there. I was at the counter first. He looked at her, then he looked at me, and he said, “You’re going to take care of her, right?” and I replied in the affirmative. She said to him, starting up a significant conversation, that she remembered he was working on the day of the downtown protest, and she thanked him for “keeping us safe” and he commented on her state and she was cool about it, “Yeah, I’m just a little drunk. ” “Did I do all right with the police officer?” outside, towards the car, grabbing onto my arm again. “Yes, you did better than some people I know would have done sober. ” “So I did all right?” “Yes. ” She asked the question a few more times, then apologized for asking too many times… “That’s your car?” she asked. “Yes. ” She let go of my arm to walk around to the passenger’s side of the vehicle. Then she said, “You know, you can sleep with me if you want. You just can’t tell Mandy. ” I didn’t respond. I put in the tape of The Smashing Pumpkins’ Siamese Dream. She rests her head against my arm. I wipe the saliva from her mouth, push her hair from her face, and she touches my hand for a moment, ha ha, whatever. I just want to take care of her but I don’t know how to because that’s her job what am I supposed to do and “I should have never slept with Mandy,” she has said, and I drive too far. Jo ends up saying she needs to pee, right now, pull over to the side of the road, okay? Just past the rotary into Agawam, by the trees, I watch the sparse traffic when it passes by, I peek over to see where she is and she’s pulling up her pants, having a hard time doing so. No, wait, they were tights, I think, so no wonder, but she’s standing, then I blink, then I look again and she’s fallen to the ground. I roll down the window. “Do you need help?” “Yes. Sorry!” What have I gotten myself into? I hope she’s okay. She can’t be okay. Look at her. She insists that she’s fine, she just needs a ride to this hotel in West Springfield. Earlier, she had asked if maybe I’d want to be a driver for her, fifty dollars per ride, and I said no. She laughed, saying, “You’re so pretentious”, and she had been calling me a little goth boy when not calling me a straight boy, but then while I looked at the bookshelf in her room she had said, “I like you. And I really wanted not to like you. ” Driving into West Springfield. She’s passed out on my arm when we arrive in the parking lot of the inn. “Jo, we’re here. ” “Uhhm… where are we?” Weakly. “We’re at the inn. ” “I need my purse and my bag.  Here’s my purse…” “Your bag is in the back, but…” She opens the door and throws up into the parking lot. She repeats this process a couple times. I hand her the bottle of water. “Okay. Hand me my bag. ” I make her wait for a bit. Then she insists she’s going to find #57. I watch the fogging of the windows as I sit in silence. A few minutes later, Jo reappears. “Let’s go, I couldn’t find the room, I’m too drunk, I’ll call and say… ugh… ugh, I shouldn’t have drunk. I’ll never drink again. ” I’m uneasy enough about the scene by this point that I don’t hesitate before starting the engine. “But,” she says, “Let’s drive around first and see if we can find 57. ” We do so. “I don’t see it,” she says. I look at the sign above the stairs: “52-58”. “Okay,” I say, “Let’s go, then. ” We pull out of the parking lot. “You can sleep with me if you want,” she says. “You already said that,” I tell her. “Sorry. ” “You already said that, too. ” Pulling into the Northampton Lodging. “You can come in if you want. ” “Well, I think I’d rather get going home,” I mumble, but then I get out of the car and go inside with her anyway. I ask where the restroom is. “Oh, you’ll need a key. I don’t have it, so I’ll have to get it from the girl in this room. ” She knocks on a door. “No, I don’t have to go that badly,” I try to say, but she keeps knocking. A woman about our age, in a nightshirt, exits. She looks at my hands and says, “Pink nail polish?” “Yeah,” Jo says. “He’s not really a boy. ” “Hm. Uh, it’s nice. It, uh, matches your eyes. ” Jo closes her door: “Come in when you’re done. ” I look at the girl in the nightshirt, who is smoking a USA Gold I gave to her. I shrug. “You’ll have to go upstairs,” she tells me. I follow her up there. She unlocks the door for me. I pee. Back in Jo’s room, she’s apologizing into the phone. She lies in bed. “Come here,” wraps around me, and I’m tired of this sort of thing. “You goth womanizer,” she says. “Yes,” I reply, “And I don’t even have to sleep with anyone to get that reputation. ” “Yeah, I hear you’re kind of scared of sex. ” “You can’t tell Mandy about this,” she says, “It’s a pheremonal thing, she smells like my mother. ” But then, eventually: “Can I drop the ho persona?” “Um, yes,” I say, “That’s fine. ” “Okay. I’ll stop trying to seduce you. ” What do I think? I’ll walk in there and see her True Essence and we’ll drink Earl Grey without pretending anything? When you call me a straight boy in words I’m offended, and I feel the same way when you call me a straight boy through your actions. I don’t really know what I want anymore, anyway. Jo fell asleep. I removed myself as stealthily as I could and drove to the Whately Diner for writing and dining. "

    "body": "30 I was merely in basic black the next night at Haven, still in a not very clubgoing mood. More gossip: Tina filled me in on the latest escapades of her love life, Alix gave me stories about the troubles in her relationship. Angry Dave talked about being angry: “Why do I keep coming here?” he said, “I never have a good time. ” My response: “You need to complain! You come here, complain about your week, then complain about being here, then you get it out of your system and go back to work the next day. ” Zella pushed the having sex with me thing more. Tonight she was dressed and made up specifically to resemble Robert Smith from The Cure, with messy black hair and lipstick. She spoke in his accent for effect. Buzzing and disconcerted, I snuggled her on a couch and asked her to find a cute boy for me. How rude of me. She said that she didn’t know many cute boys, although some men, maybe. Pfft. Semantics. Anyway, I invited her to come home with me after the club. Zella and I fell asleep in my waterbed… I don’t sleep there much anymore, except when someone’s over. Waterbeds are just meant to be shared, I think. “You’re the only person I’ve met who doesn’t need gender,” Zella had said to me. 31 So, yeah, yesterday I woke up next to Zella, and I know we kissed a little, and although it wasn’t so deep or extended as any of Zella’s kisses with any of the girls we know, of course it’s supposed to be of more significance… Tonight, coffee with Maurice, late evening to early morning. I give him a speech about his and Marie’s band, The Basement, and I’m being overly dramatic about how simple it would be for that project to be successful. Now, Northampton, Massachusetts, a flyer for a protest march in Washington, April 12, and strong words against the Bush administration on the back. 32 I’m mostly staying to myself tonight at Capo’s, reading Newsweek. It’s all about the war, about dying soldiers calling out for their mothers. I have a serious look on my face, probably. I also read a years-old copy of Adbusters. I compliment the plush kitty with multiple piercings being carried by a girl I don’t know, who asks, “You do magic, right?” I nod, and say, “Yeah. ” I’m interested in what she might be leading up to at least enough to light another cigarette. She continues. It’s about what I expected, an evil force in the cemetery, so I asked what was apparently taken as a stupid question: “Why were you in the cemetery?” “Just walking around,” she said. Well, there’s her problem right there. I forget where the night goes after that. Then, Friday morning or perhaps afternoon. A walk down the street to the convenience store, I’m feeling like a part of my local scenery again through these walks. I wasn’t itching to get out or to visit anyone. I have to make myself pretty again, is what I think, but it doesn’t happen. I give myself time to prepare before leaving to meet Zella in Northampton, but I just use that time to walk the streets listening to the pre-master of Radiohead’s Hail to the Thief, which had been leaked to the Internet. Zella’s mother is home. She likes me. I discuss politics with her. Amelia and a guy named Grant I hadn’t met before came over. Immediately there was the retreat to Zella’s room for a ceremony I hadn’t done before. (I’m not big on ceremony. ) Basic wisdom perhaps should have told me not to watch live feeds from U. S. soldiers as they entered Baghdad while my defenses were down. I was okay, though. There was lots of talk about “claiming the space” of each room, and no one being left out. I was able to separate and hold conversation with Zella’s mother, just turning to look at the television again if her face started to melt. It was a big deal that every combination of people had to get time together… and when Zella and I were having our time she found her own dramatic way of saying that I should hook up with Grant. I didn’t want to think about this too much. In Zella’s old bedroom I poked through the unabridged journals of Sylvia Plath. Then, under the covers with her, that’s when I started to get arrogant. From what she said, it sounded like she was pretty much giving up on seducing me? I told her I thought she’d be intimidated if I showed her my sexuality, anyway, and she agreed. Never kissing Zella for long, never very passionately. It didn’t feel right. Maybe I should tell her that I’m not comfortable with more than friendly pecks on the lips! That would be awesome! I slept for a little, told Zella I was leaving, and at home read from The Cartoon History of the Universe until falling asleep again, until the night. 33 I drove to Maurice’s and he took over driving responsibilities in his mother’s car, practicing for his driver’s test, for our planned summer road trip. He called Jo once we were in Northampton, to hang out and also to give her some pills. We picked her up outside of the dorm house at Smith where I had gone with her on that night of wine drinking. In fact, for the ride to Jake’s that was the topic of conversation. She didn’t remember offering to sleep with me. She groaned and apologized: “I must have thought that I was going to use you for something, to get something. But I’ll usually only do that with assholes, not to one of my peers. ” I made it clear that I wasn’t thinking of it as a big deal, while Maurice listened in, as he heard our accounts of that night. Jo criticized me for calling myself a “writer”, using the same types of argument I was afraid someone would use if I claimed a sexual orientation: “You know that ‘writer’ is a powerful term with lots of connotations,” et cetera. We back-and-forthed. In this case it was fun. Jo had to go back to Smith, then, in preparation for a call. Maurice said he’d like to get to know her better (after we’d dropped her off) and that she kind of reminded him of a young Marie. Maurice would later add that since he didn’t want to sleep with Jo his vague desire to be a driver for her sometime was “just for the experience”, for something to write about. This sort of thing he described as, “Someone’s selling their soul to me as a literary device. ” Soon after we sat down at a booth in the Whately Diner two girls sat with us, because the three gay men at the counter hadn’t seemed excited to have a conversation. (The girls claimed prejudice against their bisexuality). They worked for Clean Water Action. One of them was from Texas and had only been in town for a few weeks. They were fresh from bar-hopping. Around our age. Friendly. The nail polish on my fingers had drawn them over. I got the number for one of them, to get in touch about employment with their organization. (Maybe. I’m desperate. ) A friend of Maurice’s co-worker Erik sat at the booth behind us, with someone else I remembered from their frequent 4 AM visits to the DB Mart when I worked there. We said hello how are you and then for a cigarette and I was hopping around I don’t know if it was that I was really wired or what but conversation seemed like such a low-energy thing to be doing. I calmed down eventually, went home, wrote a song and fell asleep earlier than I had wanted to fall asleep. 34 I forgot to mention one recent occasion, sandwiched between everything else. I saw Charlie again. Charlie has lately been staying with a boy in West Springfield, and I forget his name at present, and he was spinning at a club in downtown Springfield, a club whose name I forget at present. Boy was in front of the club. He’d have to charge us the five dollar admission, he said, if we were to visit, so we instead ducked into the bar next door, where karaoke was going on. I felt slightly uncomfortable, as I’m not too familiar with the spectrum of bar scenes in general, especially in Springfield. Charlie recognized the bartender from high school days in Chicopee, and the bartender remembered him in turn, which is how it usually works out. Charlie and I have hundreds of mutual acquaintances, but he’s still always meeting up with people I don’t know and discussing lots more people I don’t know. He also struck up a conversation with the girl who happened to sit next to us at the bar while I watched somebody sing a Billy Joel song. Then back to Boy’s place of DJ residence again, and he and the owner permitted us to check out the Gay Latin Night going on upstairs. This was the second Gay Latin Night I had been to. It was a pretty fun scene. Then to the Fat Cat, which is kind of the hardcore/metal bar. Charlie immediately found people he knew, and I sat staring into space for awhile. The novelty of the night was starting to wear off, especially since I didn’t have the money to grab another drink. Some talking with Charlie’s cousin until the place closed down, then back to find Boy, bringing along Charlie’s cousin and this cousin’s friend. Standing outside, talking, women from the now-closed Gay Latin Night still lurking and prompting us to put down fake phone numbers to decide the outcome of their “how many phone numbers can you get” contest with each other. Charlie was recipient of some vague flirtation as we stood around outside, but nothing serious, but still his Boy chided him for being too friendly. Boy was starting to worry me. He was a bit controlling, even accepting that Charlie doesn’t seem to mind that. Back to the chronology. Sunday night, I had to get my wallet from Zella; I had left it at her house. She was distant and distracted but didn’t go into details about what was up until later, when she said she had been fighting with her mother. Zella’s wardrobe was in effect, so I could tell that she was ready to go somewhere—to Graff’s, she said, and he had invited me to come along also. I wasn’t feeling very social but I figured a brief stay could be fun. It was sitting at the kitchen table referencing the slew of Aleister Crowley material on the table, and though Zella was vehement about not playing a card game with its Minor Arcana (refusing to touch the deck, in fact) standard playing cards were produced for some gentleman’s poker (interrupted by Graff freaking her out—”Tell me what suit the next card will be,” flip!) then they left for the 7-11 and I drove home and backed up my collected writings to my mother’s computer, indexed slightly more efficiently than they had been. Lisa was online in the morning, preparing to head back to HCC for classes. I told her I felt like stopping by to see her there if she didn’t mind. She agreed. It was more snuggling and nibbling and tickling and occasionally briefly kissing, speaking only in jest, seeing who could prove what impossible things to the other. I tried speaking seriously again about how little we had spoken seriously of ourselves, but it didn’t work. There in the C building forum lobby where I spent so much time in years past… seeing the occasional familiar faculty member or aging student… remnants of recent ice and snow. If April showers bring May flowers, what does April snow bring? I would like to mention that this is the seventh month in a row that snow has fallen. Lisa skipped her classes while we intertwined. Will I spend my whole life doing things like this? And if so, do I mind? My paycheck from the inventory service came. While I slept through the afternoon, the area manager called about what-had-happened. He seemed aggressive and a bit prickish about it until he found out that I hadn’t gotten another job and that I would like to get back to work with them, sure, I could start tomorrow. 35 Yesterday, awake all night until it was time to reunite with my co-workers, carpooling to Connecticut for work at a Joann Fabrics store. My co-workers had grown more chummy in the two weeks I had not been working. We, the fledgling Springfield office, which has no physical office, only works technically as part of the Albany, New York branch, and uses a Stop and Shop parking lot as a meet-up spot. Work was common, repetitive, lasting about eight hours, not including the drive. Sleep, for a couple hours, having been up for a long time. Then, Haven. Jonny is there. Patrick is there. Katie might be moving out to California in a week, she says. Zella is saying goodbye, worked up by something, I don’t yet know what, I ask if she’d like my company, she says yes, but there is still the making of rounds, saying goodbye to all applicable persons. I’m not okay to drive at this point, but Zella has a permit and drives my car to her place, and we talk on her bed for a bit, and I said, “You’re trying to seduce me,” and she was like, well, kinda, yeah. We eat pizza in the kitchen. I kiss her more deeply and ask her, “What’s my sexual orientation?” She responds: “I think of you as a queer transgender bisexual. ” “Hm. Why transgender?” “Well, not totally. Because there are times when you feel more like a man, sometimes more like a woman. ” 36 Gay boys on the street tonight, but I don’t like the gay male culture much. Tina is supposed to be at the WWII Club for karaoke, right? I haven’t hung out with her very recently, y’know, every week or so you have to prove that you’re not an enemy, if you care, but lately I’m not prone to care too much, yeah, but Tina can have me as a tertiary supporter, I like it that way. 37 Post-pizza I chatted briefly with Nim as he passed, then wandered past Haymarket again as a just-in-case, let’s-see-what’s-happening sort of thing. Katie was sitting out front. She said that the others were still inside. I apologized for my way of departing before, then told her I was going to the WWII Club. Tina was there, and Rick, Kay, et al. I didn’t have much to contribute to any of their fun times, however. The larger part of the fun I did have was culled from my actual stabs at karaoke: Counting Crows’ “Mr. Jones” and a duet with Tina of Belly’s “Feed The Tree”. The latter was, uh, more appropriate for my vocal range. Katie came by just near the end. I only got to exchange waves with her. But I started to drive in one direction then started to drive home but wanted cigarettes so stopped at the first convenience store I saw, the one right next to Diva’s, and of course I thought “Maybe, just maybe, the others went here and will be leaving now?” and as I exited with cigarettes in hand, well, there they were, I could tell Graff by what he was wearing and Zella was saying something, then she said we should do coffee and I felt like Yeah! Because otherwise I would have been homeward bound on a sour note. Windshield wipers active up I-91. Harvey is at the diner, says hello and that I should IM him sometime. Zella and I sit in the corner. 38 Tomorrow is the second anniversary of Tina’s arrival to the Pioneer Valley, when I met her at the mall with Charlie and Mick. 39 The Easter Bunny waves to me.  “Hello, Easter Bunny!” I say, cheerily. I follow her inside the coffee shop. 40 Still no word from Hampshire College. I have plans for tonight, but first, I’ll get this thing done and then that thing done. I set my alarm for a couple hours in the future. It’s late afternoon, though when I’m awoken it’s by Alix again, I don’t remember the conversation because it begins with my emergence from an exhausted sleep. She’s in Longmeadow today and needs a ride to the party in Northampton. Ohhh and I so do not want to have to concentrate enough to messily scribble down directions to wherever she is in Longmeadow, but I do it anyway. As I’m running late, I move quickly as I can to get in my car towards Enfield, Connecticut, to see Alyson in a performance of Lysistrata at her Community College. It’s fun. She raps in it. I miss theater. I say to her that hey, I showed up, how are you and congratulations, then it’s time to attempt to locate Alix. Lost in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and leaf piles in the road and lots of homes, expensive living, a freaky sense of discomfort the whole time I’m there, and I find the correct street but not the house number, then drive some more until I come to that area in town with stores, and a friendly boy in the Friendly’s tells me there’s a pay phone across the street but I don’t have enough change, I realize once I get there, and nothing in town is open so I just find the highway again, and, maybe Alix will forgive me? The package store is closed, it’s a busy Saturday night and people are excited and active everywhere I pass, more of a night life than usual, even for a weekend, it seems. I head to Kevin and Polly’s place, then. 41 Liv looked good, I noticed right off the bat, and she seemed pleased to see me, there with Sarah H. and the occasional cameo by Mole. My experiences with Liv are so far in the past now, really. Three and a half years. Jonny sitting in the kitchen. His computer has been fixed and returned, so we make plans to work on those much-fabled Levi Adams Rock Quintet recordings, for Monday. A couple times I walk the perimeter of the party’s happenings, but I want to sit, so there I am next to Zella while she makes plans with Jess for the two of them to fuck sometime. “Ah, I see how it is,” I say, “You two will just be distracted, flirting all night,” and Zella gives me a look like, “Me? Flirt? Never!” Jess and I both need to buy some cigarettes, and after she’s let me have a shot of her Captain Morgan’s, with a swig of Sprite as a chaser, we head downstairs. Her hair has been changing colors lately. She’s so much different single, all she talks about seems to be that, that she’s single, and wants this or that. We stumble to the 7-11 and then back. Nim arrives, and after a bit says that he’s going with Mia to explore underground tunnels. Well, I had never heard of tunnels under Northampton, so I said, “I want to do that!” and he invited me along. Zella wanted to go, too, but was concerned about the clothes she wore, so didn’t. Stop everything. Okay. Present tense flash. Tori over the speakers at The Thirsty Mind as I’m writing this. But now just any Tori. “Horses”. Boys for Pele. Boys. For fucking Pele. Is it LEGAL to play this album in public? “Blood Roses”. They are playing this. Cigarette. Then, we’ll see… I could hear the album still from the outside while I gave someone a cigarette and “SELLING HIS BABY JUST LIKE MY DADDY” just came home “and everywhere a Judas, as far as you can see. A beautiful angel, ca-ha-ha-all-ing, ‘We got every rerun of Muhammad Ali’” —just came here from— “The principle of proportion, boy, it’s gotta be big, boy, IT’D BETTER BE BIG”— Helena, my Tori story of ‘02, when we met in the store, Boston, met her, oh the—I remember “Figure it out” she was a good “‘Too bad the burial was PREMATURE,’ she said, and smiled” a good one you know though ridiculous really typical for me you know because I could have, you know, I really liked her and maybe, maybe, oh Love you presence even there in the night for me what have I done for you and giving up giving up but I struggle against myself “They’re watching my every sound” (decaf coffee again) (maybe contributing to it all) (to whom do I owe it not to go these places in myself?) “I’m just having thoughts, I said I’m just” but Helena was suddenly “SHE COULD OUTRUN THE FASTEST SLUG” very stable and respectful seeming to me and seemed well you know? And said that we had so much to talk about. And I want one more night on the phone because, I knew it all along, wanting, not wanting, but knowing, feeling, she was one of those, don’t have to speak, why do we speak, I’m overrun sometimes by pretendings I’m not always equipped to “BIG LOAN FROM THE GIRL ZONE” and yeah “The spire is” and what these words are I can’t say but see “Buildings TUMBLING DOWN didn’t know our love was so small” I’m just a fool artist crazy knowing love knowing, not wanting to get lost, so impossible but all that I can work with is the impossible. So glad I’m still alive, it’s not like I was planning on it but you know I never could really sort through all these emotions LOOKING OUT FOR the feelings of others without release SEE WHAT IT CAN DO and the simplest mistakes I can make sometimes.  Back to chronology, Those underground things, that was the plan, Mia calling her girlfriend, picking her up at Hampshire, and me plus Nim’s dog hanging out by the trees waiting, then a guy Chris meeting up with us just on the street while it’s like 3 AM and there are still occasional, passing individuals on this night, outside, but it’s nice, and everyone’s nice, and (of course everyone is connected) “Till I get my own (honey) TV show”… “Pope’s rubber robe”… “We both know it was a girl” (Another cup of decaf, please. ) To the path down kinda precarious just a path downhill but we have lights we can use when we crawl into the tunnel, a storm drain. Four feet, maybe? Moving so quickly ever deeper and never thought I was claustrophobic, “Guess it’s clear that he’s gone, and this little masochist is lifting up her dress” deeper to the tunnel and thank you Mia for agreeing to exit with me, I wasn’t comfortable, only down to the little room, really just a basic sewer, “Maybe I’m the afterglow” anarchy scribblings on the wall, “I think there might be others down here” “Well, other people down here isn’t a bad thing, we just have to be polite” Mia and I exit then I go back to the party, buzz me in, it’s LEVI. “Hominy, get it on the plate girl”… “I’m just comin’ outta the cell in my brain”… “‘Cause girl you’ve got to know these days what side you’re on”… (Overheard in coffeeshop: “He committed treason. ”) No I just want to be like this it’s okay you see because, we all, you know, you have, don’t you hide things? Cigarette two. Back at the party. Seeing Katie, who is truly leaving for England within a week. “Take me with you!” I beg. “Come with me, Levi!” We repeat the process in futility. Katie gives me a glass of wine, pours it and everything, but I can’t appreciate it, it’s not right, what she sticks to, I can’t do it, “You never gain weight from a doughnut hole” (“Why do you look like someone just died?” a gal says to a girl, now. ) “And if I’m hanging on to your shade, I guess I’m way beyond the pale” but then on the couch (I spill my coffee, clean it with napkins) “You told me last night you were a sinner with your very own devoted satellite, happy for you and I’m sure that I hate you” on the couch next to Zella and Jess again and then Zella in lust drags Jess to a bedroom and Jess is like, “Here? Now? Ah, I’m scared! I’m drunk!” And… who was it? Nick. He was like, “Ooo, I’m gonna watch!” So I played it cool by saying, “Me too!” Ha, ha, yes, that’s me, but no, not really. I actually don’t want to see Jess taken advantage of. “Ah, not while people watch!” and Zella blames me for ruining her chance at drunken sex but I’m unapologetic, lying back against the wall while Zella just sits on the bed, smoking cigarettes, and funny thing about Zella is that she likes when I say it outright, that I know we’re all just knee-jerk reacting to what we temporarily convince ourselves is what is happening, and the way we can’t talk about some things, we just can’t, not effectively, not with true or false at least, need more coordinates than that, oh but even, y’know, there’s craziness then, too, as a fallback plan. And I do appreciate that, because I get the impression we’ll need to be past religion, all of us, if we’re to be anything at all, how improbable is that when our heads are already exploding from Internet information overload theoretical WTFs and not even being able to think of education as more than menial labor anymore because it is but then we start talking about us instead. She switches modes immediately when I turn her + Jess politics into her + me politics. Tina coming in, saying something, Zella saying to her, “You, me, Jess in a bed together, drunk. What do you think is going to happen?” Tina: “Jess is scared. ” So I turn the situation around, because I can involve myself, once Tina is gone I say, “I thought you had invited me over” and I continue, “Oh, am I just a contingency plan?” and by now I know it’s okay. She’s talking again about wanting to have sex with me, as though trying to say that she retracted her previously made declaration that she wasn’t looking for that anymore. Whatever’s right for today, yeah, and I start to think, finally, that, well, okay, Zella, yeah, let’s go back to your place. 42 When we’re in her room, and she has changed her clothes and climbed into bed next to me. Holding. That’s what she most frequently requested, and that’s what she most frequently received. Anyway. We just, yeah. We didn’t do anything else. 43 And I don’t see anyone on Sunday. Monday, it’s Monday to me, I’ll check up on things at Hampshire, then get in touch with Jonny. 44 Today’s a big date in my head, the “notification by” date listed by Hampshire. Tom from HCC never did send his recommendation, but “notifications will be mailed out tomorrow,” said the woman, noting that mine would be reviewed even if incomplete. Kinda sucks. Plus, no one but I and my father seem to have entertained the notion that I might not be accepted. 45 Aaaand… I did not get into Hampshire College. "

    "body": "1 The sequence is certain, but causation is tenuous. Before the Bright Eyes/Arab Strap concert I’m at Zella’s place. And Tina is there. Then I go to wait in front of the venue early. I sit up on the side platform next to the stage. Zella arrives and starts talking to all the high school kids around us. And outside between sets for a smoke, Jo is there with Rebecca. And throughout the show I engage in my usual concert-going clapping and bopping. Maurice had told me to apply to Bart’s, the ice cream shop/coffee shop where he worked. Following this, he said that he was bugging the manager to hire me. His friend and co-worker, Erik, was doing the same for his friend Zach. Eventually I and Zach were both hired. Interlude with a friend on a perfect night, a walk through sunrise where the nicest houses chip as antiques, now the country is old with her extended attention, perusing photos as though I had never liked her too much. In a space where the naked form is immortalized, our cloth is but amateur discourse on the restoration of historical love. I liked boys, I said, and she couldn’t see the problem. (From the shower an inhabitant says that her rites were “wet” and grabs a bagel. ) I have found truth unconditional in their breath of suffocation; faith honors, then emulates, ye fates to which we devote our resignation. Sarah F. came up to me at Haven one night and was single and flirting and we made out and in her car talking and Dunkin Donuts and she was befriending Sarah X. at the same time, making us a little clique talking about “toast”. I went to a bar after work to pick up Charlie. A bad rock band from Boston was playing. I had a beer and then we left. Charlie yelled to a passing driver that he should put his lights on. He pulled over; he knew him. He exited the car, started talking about how he’s one of his favorite people, he missed him hey. Hey, wanna go to Ye Olde Watering Hole? No, he’s kicked out of the Watering Hole. I estimate that after I read a half dozen more books then maybe I’ll be able to work on the problem of my identity a little. Until then I’ll just continue to play with the hair of boys who say they’d date me if I were female, until I’m distracted by another loud, spunky, assertive woman who blatantly views me as a manifestation of some fictional character or celebrity, who showers me with such attention that other boys will, depending on their demeanor, either look at me jealously or begin to hang around with me for the sake of trying to pick up the other girls I don’t end up with, while I spend so much energy contending with said woman’s larger-than-life nature that I end up effectively in a relationship whether I wanted one or not. No, I won’t. I’ll stop that. And I’ll go to college. Your justifications are pathetic and dangerous. You’ve gone from hopelessly trusting to hopelessly paranoid. I need to be able to talk with people. I know. I remember when I said to Mandy, “Some people go really far to believe that they have huge conspiracies against them, but I try not to and I still see it, really blatantly in front of my face, that I seriously have huge conspiracies against me. ” “Yes, you do,” she said. Tommy wants me to come over tonight. I’ll try to squeeze that in with Maurice’s poetry reading. Tommy made me uneasy, though. I mentioned that I had stopped by his place while he was out of town, that I’d talked for a bit with his girlfriend. He stopped me: “No, this isn’t about Millie. She beats me up. If you come over and we do music, it’s not about Millie, not about anyone else we know. ” Eek. Sorry for… mentioning your girlfriend? I got a phone call yesterday saying to expect a phone call today so that I could find out where to drop off that rental application. Credit reference? Check. Bank reference? Check. Rental history? I don’t have the contact info. Work? Well. My current job = insufficient hours. Second job = pending, perhaps put it down with a note in the margin, it was a previous job, left in good standing, I re-applied, there should be no problem being rehired, no scheduling conflict, the two jobs together will be more than enough, hey hey! My potential roommates are confident, and that’s probably a good way to be, so I won’t enumerate my concerns and instead will shrug my shoulders and admit that I don’t know, just, duh, can’t afford to screw up figuring something, at least, by the fall. This would be good, though: living in bulk allows for niceness of space, reduced rent, prime location for work, play, school. Hey, we’re not supposed to get insects this big around here. But: a legitimately-sized spider just outside one door. Just hangin’ out. Since I’ve already walked into some webbing, I decide to use the other door. A big… dragonfly? I think? lands on me. I try to get a good look at it, but it flies away. Ah well. Shopping didn’t bring me much; stores frighten me. Now? I forget what I was going to do. Organize my material possessions or something. Oh yeah, I pulled into the shopping mall parking lot, and apparently I stole somebody’s space, making me a “fucking asshole”. I just watched him expressionlessly as though he were a television, because, uh, there were empty spaces like two cars over, dude, and I thought you were going for one of those. And on the way out back to my car, I managed to envision an elaborate fantasy of my car having been desecrated by this disgruntled man’s envy of my parking spot. And for a moment, I thought I was right, because… hey, wasn’t that my car? Whoa, it looks like the trunk is partway open. Did he massively rear-end me and crush my back end? That would be pretty cool. But no, it was just another car, the same make and model as mine, with a bicycle crammed into the trunk, sticking out partway. The teenager inside was watching me, like, Why is he staring at my new bicycle? I’ve recently been easing myself into… well, masculine territory. I’ve had sooooooo many more female friends than male. I’ve got to admit that even hearing the word ‘men’ I don’t get a clear image in my head. For a while, it was like I forgot that they existed. But now I’m starting to see them more. As friends, peers, and. I can also get fucking googly over them more often, along with this. I recognize that I’m a white person and therefore to some extent always a snotty little fucker who feels he shouldn’t need to change in order to gain validation, but the boy/girl thing just pains me. It’s not a desire to be a woman. It’s a stubborn resistance against the severity of the distinction. There’s something bizarre about me. My mother doesn’t like anything. It’s insane to try and find gifts for her. Meanwhile, she wants to give me tickets that her boyfriend Bruce won, to go see Santana on her birthday, because she doesn’t know that she feels like going. I can’t fall asleep and it’s 10 AM! I haven’t even had any caffeine since 2 AM. Latest news: a pending relocation to Northampton at the start of July, which can poise me to take classes at Greenfield Community College for the purpose of obtaining an Associate’s Degree. That’s what I’m heading for now. The news arrived on Tuesday, at Haven. Katie (who, with Rick and Bryan, will also be in the apartment): “Guess who has a place!” “Us?!” The signing of the lease is tomorrow morning. This Tuesday was a curious day.  Prior to Haven: time with Grant.  He’s a boy I initially met through Zella, at her place. Gay. Tall. Good taste in music. Also on this night, we were hanging with Liz—who I first met at Haven—ugh, a year? two? ago. We watched Nowhere (an odd film) then went to the diner. Grant invited me to sleep over, and we hooked up. We haven’t gone very far in getting to know each other. Maybe that’s a part of his personality? So far I’m uncertain what to worry about, if anything. After Haven, there was a couple fighting outside, and meanwhile Ian was canceling a planned hot tub trip, and trying more to throw himself at Dan, who is straight, who held me tightly for protection. Sarah F. and Sarah X. wanted to spend time with Phil. Sarah X. thought that I might hang out with them, too, but when Phil said he couldn’t go with them I read Sarah F. ’s expression (correctly, as it turns out)—she didn’t want my company that night, for one reason for another. No biggie. I’ve been staying in more. Reading. The intimidating task of organizing, saving or disposing of, my possessions. Some things can serve as unexpected morale boosters, when I try out old VHS cassettes to find 1990’s MTV, 120 Minutes, “Flowers in December” by Mazzy Star or “Army” by Ben Folds Five. Though mostly I’m throwing things out, I’ll only have so much space in my room. I don’t need a zillion boxes left at my mother’s place. My glasses broke yesterday, my newly-acquired eyeglasses, when I grabbed boxes from the restaurant where my mom works, for packing, and the glasses were on the seat when I moved it forward to put the boxes in my backseat. A one year lease, let’s just let the situation be… negotiable. We’re a weird crowd, but I don’t foresee anything unmanageable. I trust Katie. One year in Northampton is long enough to get an Associate’s degree and then leave town. I waited at the new apartment, Cherry Street, Northampton, Massachusetts, 100 degree weather. Where were they? I walked briefly in one direction, by a large cemetery, and then in the other, toward the downtown, past an older woman washing her car. No sign of anyone I knew, so I stopped by Zella’s. Graff was working on the roof of the house next door. Zella seemed spry. Her being in air conditioning helped this, I’m sure. The three of us ate sandwiches in the kitchen before I had to go. Back at Cherry Street, I had the first floor room pointed out as the one suggested to me. It had no closet, but I was okay with it still. There was the signing of the lease, then, and the handing over of the first/last/security payments. Then to the Vermont Country Deli. Katie works there and had to be in work, plus we wanted food. “Nothing like a nice hot bowl of soup when the temperature is sweltering, eh?” commented Rick when he saw my choice of lunch. Back to Chicopee, my mother’s boyfriend’s daughter Alyssa, visiting from Florida, was now trying to do multiplication. I spent some time tutoring her before I cashed my paycheck, grabbed beer in advance of the party, and headed back to Northampton for work at Bart’s. Hoog and Zach and Christina were working. Christina refilled the containers of iced espresso and talked about how much she preferred doing that to serving customers, because she hates people. I started closing procedures early, forgetting that it was Friday and that therefore we closed at midnight instead of at 11. First thing at the party, Tina told me to follow her, and handed me a Jell-o shot. Plenty of folks were at the party. Liv was at the kitchen table with Sarah H. “I’ve been thinking of you lately,” I told Liv, “Because of the new Liz Phair album. ” I asked Sarah H. whether it was okay that I missed Liv. “No,” she said. Grant was there. He wasn’t treating me as anything special. Not that this is always a bad thing. I just like getting the chance to talk about shit. Hell, but then again, I’ve been busy, too. I watched the partygoers bump and grind to urban dance music from my corner sitting on boxes and purring when someone came by to touch me, but not dancing for longer than a few seconds, because I find it hard to dance to that kind of music. When I try, I dance even more like a drag queen than Grant, who actually is a drag queen. And Charlie telling me to drive him home? On the roof for awhile, Kevin reminiscing of old parties. Lydia and Tina have to cram into the back of my car, I was driving them. Thanks Lydia for the back pounding slash massage you gave me at the party, we’ll all be seein’ each other around, I’ll be just down the street. Charlie holding my hand and “I love you” on the way home, reading my mind and saying my name. He had a wedding to attend in a few hours. I went home and slept. And at the party, Tina, crouching down to me: “Levi! You and Grant!” her eyebrows, and me, “Yeah, but he just left and was in too much of a hurry to hug me goodbye” and she made some disposable excuses for him and said, “But the two of you? How super cute is that! You need to get married or something. ” So much is changing already. I have a home, and I’m defending it. Not just the apartment, everything. It’s the lifestyle, the folks with whom I surround myself. I’m shooing the guilt away. Overwhelming, almost, at moments, but feeling sorry for myself only disrupts it all. I lay in bed for some time while light sounds of neighbors caught my attention more and more. A shower. I needed a shower… but I also needed coffee, so a walk into town for that. A newspaper on the steps for employment, what second job would mesh well with Bart’s? Need to keep myself in that mindset. Talked to Maurice for pointers on being a good fit for our workplace, because I would like to be. Setting up my enrollment at Greenfield Community College also needs to be done. It feels lovely to live in Northampton. 2 July 4, 2003. The cats came today: Buddha and Fug. Upon being released, Fug immediately made himself comfortable in my room, while Buddha was hesitant to leave his traveling carriage and, upon being released, wanted to explore the house. The two fight whenever they cross paths. Fug attacks viciously, but Buddha is bigger and stronger, so gets his way. I’m the last to go to sleep. Buddha followed me around, though he had paid me no attention while others were around. I tried to get him to stay in one place, and like, dude, cat, how codependent are you? Then you just sit around lazily once you’ve found company! So I found Fug, he was at the top of the first set of stairs, I beckoned him: “Come on down to my room,” waving my arm invitingly. (He had found a corner to slink off into while I’d chatted with my roommates. ) He came and followed me to my room, until close behind him came Buddha. Fug hissed and lunged forward with claws extended. There was a scuffle, then Buddha entered the room in Fug’s place. Story with Fug: a mosquito was in my room. I usually can’t bring myself to kill any sort of insect, so I just batted it out of the way. Then it went for Fug. The mosquito landed right between his eyes. He didn’t move, only winced, as the mosquito bit him. I shooed the mosquito from him. Then the mosquito came for me again. I lost it. I grabbed a tissue and killed it, and when I did this Fug immediately jumped down from my bed, stood at my feet, and, for the first time, hissed at me. Katie had warned me to back off if Fug ever hissed, so I went to the other room, sat, listened to the band playing next door, and thought about what I had done. Later, Fug came and purred and rubbed against me. “He lived alone too long,” said Bryan about Fug. “Me too,” I responded. Fug hissed and tried to attack Buddha. “Though,” I said, “I suppose I don’t go around trying to maim those who are used to having family around. ” 3 July 6. People are over a lot here. I like having a living room where people sometimes are. Haven’t even missed the Internet much. I sat with Maurice the other night, keeping him company for a bit. Someone had invited him to this bar, they were performing in a band there, I asked him for a critique of my performance at Bart’s. After work the next day, I get home and am told that someone robbed Bryan’s PS2 from the living room. The theft was being made into a mystery story: neighbors said that the guy whom Katie and her boyfriend saw sketchily rounding the corner from behind the house adjusting his backpack had come by earlier to ask if someone by a certain name lived in our place, to which the neighbor replied that he didn’t know. Then a bunch of us tonight sat in the living room, and Rick picked up a piece of paper from the floor (he had been pacing) and it read: D- Just go inside I’ll leave my door open and will be home soon.  -Gabe Only Katie seemed to want to follow this up. Bryan himself shrugged off the loss, and Rick agreed that what good would it do to get angry? I lost my digital camera last night, too. Brought it into the downtown and left it somewhere, not to be found upon my return. Also, yesterday, Sarah F. came over crying and we were among Polly, Kevin, Patrick, others who were drinking beer. People danced in Katie’s room and Rick taught everyone to fling bottle caps. Then Sarah F. and I returned to bed and did bodily things. "

    "body": "4 July 6. Lydia stops over, fresh from some party. Gets my attention by casting shadows onto the book I’m reading on the living room couch. Says she’s told people about this living situation and they say there’s no way in Hell! I don’t really understand that. She flips through my record collection before leaving. 5 July 13, 2003. Our housewarming party. The first version of the flyer I designed for it featured President Lyndon B. Johnson. My roommates didn’t like it. The second draft featured a PC paintbrush-drawn house ablaze, plus a bottle of booze. They preferred that one. The night it happened, I had been cleaning furiously to prepare. There was alcohol, lots of it. I kept going outside to tell people to keep it down. Erik and Maurice and Zach showed up for a bit between the other parties they were going to. I cuddled between Sarah F. and Sarah X. on my bed. Smarf said he didn’t understand how I was such a womanizer. He congratulated me. Over the course of the next week I cleaned up the mess that the party had left. Feeling sick and thinking that I smoke too much. Running to the laundromat to the post office to one convenience store and then the other. Forgetting the last time I slept. 6 Frankincense and myrrh and The Cure’s Disintegration was how I started being able to sleep on command, a little bit. 7 August 9. Working in this college town. We take runs to the liquor store for something to keep us entertained while we work. “See, I’m not familiar with your way of partying,” I say, pointing to Maurice’s and Zach’s 40s, and to my six-pack of bottles. “Yeah, be glad for that. Unless you wanna be like us. Look at us and then look at you. You look like the clothes you’re wearing have been washed recently, at least. ” By the end of the night, Grant is there as planned: “I stole a bottle of wine just for tonight. ” But I’m still pissed off, thinking how he had barely given me the time of day after our one night together and his then finding a different boy to whom he could cling, how the day after he gave up on said boy he was suddenly all about me again. “Wanna go to a party first?” because Maurice has said that we could come along. There are a lot of strangers there, a queer scene, and I’m having a good time although Grant takes time to adjust and I say here, have one of my beers and Grant has Zach spilling his guts to him, kinda, and I like them both better for it. Back to my apartment approaching 4 AM, my roommates have guests and are drinking. Once I mediate and get Grant and Tina to make up for some little issue between them, several of us hang out in my room and Tina shows us some sexy photos. She beams, then leaves the two of us alone. And oh I’m tired, I’ve had wine mixing with earlier beer and I’m in bed with Grant. I fall asleep, but then he starts touching kissing and I’m resisting but he teases in that way further in future moments and when I come it lasts forever but then I get up, smoke a cigarette, and he’s lying there, eyes closed, by himself, holding a pillow and crying and Helena IMs, says it’s funny that she’s seeing me online, because she was just thinking about me. She was thinking about when we were in Boston and I wrote about the ducks. Her seeing me sitting cross-legged and my hair in the rain. She apologizes for having gotten distant on me, says that I’m more important to her than I think. We add each other on Friendster. We talked on the phone about every night for a week. The talks were as fun and subtle and comforting as they had been the year prior. She kept saying that I needed to visit, she was in the process of moving back to Boston for the semester, we’d see each other again. On the phone with her. She said something like, ‘I close my eyes and I see pieces of the past, present, and future. Like, pixelated. ’ And I said something like, ‘Wow, that’s beautiful’ and she said, “No, Levi, it’s not. I’m going crazy. ” My Friendster testimonial for her said something about how sometimes it’s a good idea to make a mix tape to send to somebody, in order to communicate subtle things that couldn’t be said verbally, but that if somebody did that for Helena, even that would seem tactless to her, and anyway, she already knew. On the phone she agreed with what I’d written, but then said that I should send her a mix CD, because she didn’t have a tape player. I didn’t expect to be able to, but I assembled a mix CD for her. I was going to mail it, but I didn’t remember her last name. I wanted to ask her for her last name, the next time we were on the phone… but she didn’t call, and she didn’t answer when I tried to call her. I finally asked over email. She told me. I sent it to her. She acknowledged receipt of it, asked when would be a good time to call. She didn’t call. On the sidewalk. The perfect autumn night. Apple cider from Bart’s, which has now become the Double Rainbow, but I’m not working tonight. Everything is frivolous and slow-moving. People wear hoodies. Where there are hoodies there is love. I had spoken online and on the phone with Julian. He seemed fun. He moved to the area from Cape Cod. I had started talking to him knowing that he was dating Kurt. Yes, I’ve read Stranger in a Strange Land. Yes, we know things in common and like to smile and laugh with it. I tried to find his apartment in Amherst, but all the directions I had been able to find didn’t specify the absurd number of turns that were necessary to stay on the correct road. The next day I tried again, armed with better instructions. Finding the housing complex still involved hassles: as soon as I was on unfamiliar territory and looking for landmarks that would tell me where I was, it began to rain, then downpour. Then lightning. Then hail. This bizarre little storm lasted about five minutes, then let up as I was finding a parking spot. Seeing him for the first time. His roommate at the computer. Smiling confident comfortable, just going, saying things and it was mellow and nice, but not mellow, maybe, just not hypertense, he hadn’t been outside for the extent of the brief storm, just knew that it had rained a little, walk to my car, he hadn’t even much explored the center of Amherst, so I took him there, we walked to Rao’s, the coffee shop there, which was little and we stood waiting for a minute before somebody left a table that we could sit at, he drank hot chocolate and I had a Mint Mochaccino, chatting, the time was passing by and it was smiley, we walked out and then he didn’t know where to go, I wasn’t sure what to offer, but I looked up to the sky, it was a nice night, yes, it was a nice night, I pointed at some shape in the clouds, he pointed out another, that there until we’d spotted the images in each of the clouds, and we could always see what the other saw but maybe said it looked like this other thing, too, crossed the street and didn’t get far before hugging a long time, wasn’t raining, but I was holding his umbrella open, laughter, whoever thought of picking out cloud shapes then standing forever hugging under an umbrella when it wasn’t raining it was smiley where else the Hampshire Mall comics store browsing what movies playing not much then “Stairway to Heaven” disco ball overhead I, “Oh, skating rink,” staircase, Retro Night, he bladed and I skated, he held my hand and we skated around, just kept skating through all the songs, I was to drop him off, we stopped at his complex, next to the recycling thing, hugging again, he didn’t stop and I didn’t stop, Kurt called, he talked to him and I sat there, I guess, or stood, looking at things, feeling okay, I wasn’t smoking cigarettes, things were okay, then, just after, we kissed, “Which one of us started that?” It was attentive kissing. Then back to his place. He took me into the kitchen, which was just connected to the living room where his roommate was, but his roommate couldn’t see. While he nibbled on me, actually bit me, and I squirmed, I so squirmed. It was too much there leaning on the counter and I said hey let’s go somewhere else then! I was hungry, let’s get something to eat. So we went to that Domino’s in Hadley, which stays open so late… and that guy who always used to be at the Enfield Denny’s was working there, like a cameo from a comedian you wouldn’t expect to see in this film. He took our order then was on the phone saying, “Yes, of course there’s cheese on it. What kind of a place would give you a pizza without cheese?” then turned to us and said, “Hey, there’s no caressing allowed in the waiting area!” then looked behind him to the guy smoking a cigarette in back and said, “But then, of course, there’s also no smoking anywhere in the building” and shrugged. We ate our shared medium pepperoni pizza in the car and (always kissing interrupting) then I dropped him off and drove home down Route 9, which at night is kind of nice in some sentimental way, I don’t know, although driving that road during the day is crappy. Night 2: to Northampton. Walk. Stop in at the Double Rainbow, say hello while the folks there closed and the hangout crowd was just leaving. To my place, then we were on my bed for awhile. I suck on his finger. “You do that too well. ” “Is there any such thing?” “When it turns me on and I’m not about to do anything about it. ” “Ah, good point. We need a safe word for when you’re getting too turned on, then. ” “(Laugh) Safe word! What will it be?” “Rutabaga. ” He sleeps over. I drive him back. The next day, after a run to the bank, I meet up with Tina, Graff and Zella. I’m hugging Zella in the cosmetics section of CVS, when there’s Julian! In uniform. This is the store he had transferred to! We stand and talk. We’re talking for a while. I should hang out with him after he gets out, so we made out on a bench in Pulsaki Park… then sitting in Haymarket before I work and he catches the bus. His weekend plans were called off. I picked him up again and we came back to my place and as we lay in bed I said, “I have to be honest about this. I’m concerned that… well, just because of the way things have panned out, I’ve been making out with you all week and Kurt doesn’t know. ” Not really said in a worried tone of voice. More like, ‘That’s funny, but… also not funny’, that tone of voice. He told me that he and Kurt weren’t together anymore. Because of this-n-that. Not permanently not-together, but at the moment not-together. I hadn’t known that detail. I had only felt secure that he wasn’t going to do anything with me that he thought would compromise whatever he had with Kurt. He seemed like that type of person. I guess that was kinda prelude to what happened that night. He bit me like I had never been bit before. He told me how cute or whatever I was. Said that he was normal-looking but that I was something beyond that. The purple in my hair clashed in an exciting way against the usually-turquoise of my eyes. (I thought about this all later, looking in the mirror at Packards one afternoon while I waited for a burger. ) When I saw that I had left marks on him, my gut told me that things between us would be over soon. 8 Dec. 4, 2003. I saw Alix online and she said that she had left Henry. She was at her mom’s house. I had an English class to attend, but I got directions so that I could come by after. She said that the night before had been the night of freaking out and listening to Fiona Apple. We played guitar and sang our songs for each other, as usual. I suggested that we go to see a movie. We stopped for pizza first. Sarah N. happened in. She and I pleasantly caught up on how we’ve been, the way grown-ups do. “Good,” she said when I talked about applying to schools. “Get out of here. ” In a nice way, just like I say the same thing to certain others. I noticed that she had taken out her nose piercing. I don’t usually notice these things. The whole day had been a winter cold with small amounts of snow sticking, glazing the grass. That’s why I had been listening to The Postal Service on repeat in the right lane of the highway behind overly cautious drivers. Lost in Translation was a satisfying choice. I didn’t think to turn off the windshield wipers the entire ride when I dropped Alix back off. We were driving out from the town center beyond Smith College into the quiet and the dark of perfect houses. “There was my high school,” she said. “It was all about what your last name was. ” “My high school was just angry,” I said. 9 Dec. 5. The Whately Diner. I meekly wished that I could see Robyn here tonight… and it turns out she’s behind the counter and works here now. Nice. The snow is picking up. Flurries have been on and off the past couple days. This looks to be a little more substantial. I need a job. That was penciled into my agenda for today, except that I somehow managed to sleep from 2 AM until 7 PM (without feeling rested). A strange week messed with my stability somewhat. Some form of alcohol consumption colored almost every night. I rushed to finish an Ethics paper in defense of gay marriage. Oh, did I mention? Yes, I started classes, and the semester is nearly over now. (I haven’t been keeping a journal these past few months, obviously. ) Eyes on the prize, the prize being the ability to move on. 10 Dec. 6. Journals and diners are a package deal, so now I’m at Kathy’s with some breakfast food. Lots of practical business must be attended to this morning, before I fall asleep. The end of this month will be the end of this year will be the halfway point of the duration of my apartment’s lease. All things considered, these months have been very much a return to the way I used to be, when I spent most of my time alone, looking into myself to find what I want from my future. A closer look at this town of Northampton has demonstrated what I should have known all along, that all those Unspeakable Things here which bring me comfort can really be found anywhere. I came from a town I would never bother to think twice of if I hadn’t lived there since infancy. My teenage First Love, V. , came from Bakersfield, California. What I found through infiltrating the youth culture of this area (Hampshire County and Northampton in particular) was not Mecca, but a house of mirrors. This time has had its Life Changing Experiences and all that, but staying here I wouldn’t feel free… and who would expect me to stay when I could go, anyway? (There is still a love I chase, like a balloon in the breeze. ) I keep thinking that I should email V. again. She got in touch a couple months back. Silvia (who has a LiveJournal now) saw her on a visit down from San Francisco, apparently, and gave her copies of some of my music, and this reminder of me was enough for V. to email and say, ‘Hey, how’ve you been, I’ve been with my boyfriend awhile now, I’m majoring in Anthropology and you need to get De-Loused in the Comatorium by The Mars Volta. ’ I replied, she replied, then I never replied back. I’m dumb like that. 11 Zella can’t talk thanks to her having inhaled too much acetate from nail glue? She came over to pick up a mix tape and CD I made for her. We’re at Barnes and Noble now. I sat down with a Disinformation book and she started reading it. Hey, Zella, get back to studying for the GED! I brought that Disinformation book to the table for me! 12 Zella is reading a magazine. Her hair is many shades of purple. Christmas carols are playing. I am determined to get past the obstacles I was born with/came across/made for myself. Like, I won’t be a waste of potential. I will make necessary sacrifices. It is okay that I am odd. It is okay that I am silly. 13 Dec. 9. Got my hair cut. I was very casual about the matter, but, since I was getting so much of it lopped off, the hairdresser was very nicely cautious about it: “Okay, you ready? There’s no turning back after this!” I told her it seemed common enough to me, that I was chopping off a bunch of hair. It grows quickly, and I’ve grown, then chopped, grown, then chopped a number of times before. I think it’s pretty okay—impressively, because I’ve been satisfied with haircuts almost never. I would have asked for her name, so that I could go back and ask for her if I’d like to get more stuff done with my hair professionally, but I was feeling shy. Paper must be finished, and presentation must be prepared for by 2 PM… I just woke up. It’s maybe four-something in the AM now? 14 It’s morning. There’s snow outside. I haven’t done any Christmas shopping, nor have I asked for anything. I don’t want Christmas presents; I want money. The more I own, the more there is to get messed up. I want to get rid of things for Christmas. I did my presentation for Technology and Literature class. Mine was the worst presentation in the class so far. I went there and kind of stammered and didn’t even get to the point of the paper I had written. The paper, on the other hand, was worthy of an A. Confused about the world. Reading Baudrillard in my spare time doesn’t help. Wearing a plum-colored shirt. Maybe later today I’ll want to sit around and watch strangers from the corner of my eye. "

    "title": "XI. The One Year Plan (15-25)",
    "body": "15 I’m at Greenfield Community College. Got here early because I wanted to. Also because I wanted to look over the case study we’ll be using in Ethics class. I’m going to Cambridge tomorrow to see Rasputina at the Middle East. Someone I’ve been talking with through LiveJournal offered me an extra ticket when I commented that I wanted to go, but shouldn’t spend the money. Now, if only I knew this person’s real name, eh? I went to drop those overdue books off at the school library. I don’t remember a good way to get there except to use the handicapped-accessible elevator, so I used that. Then I stood on a bench outside, leaning against the wall smoking a cigarette, watching the art students go by and thinking how many times the administrative people at this school have assumed, “Are you an art major?” and, like, no, no, I’m not an art major, I’m just… y’know, different. 16 My One Year Plan, which I’ve decided to dub “Plan Run Far Far Away”, is approaching the halfway mark. 17 Well, that was interesting. I drove into Cambridge, tried to find a way to turn around so I could pull into a parking space, got lost around MIT, then Boston, then strange and unfortunate-looking areas of Cambridge. Kerrin, whom I knew through LiveJournal, called my name as I arrived at the Middle East. She was chatting with the singer for the second act on the show’s bill. Then to the entrance—”He’s my plus-one,” This was my first time downstairs at the Middle East. She didn’t really make any introductory chatter with me. She left to meander. I drank and sat and the first act was on and I went outside (no smoking inside) and then I was inside again still drinking and the second act was on and I was in a very weird state, thinking about how I wanted to sleep with everyone, and after the second act, in a bid to escape from the trappings inside my head, I tapped the shoulder of a girl in front of me and said, “Hi, why are you standing still by yourself there?” and she said she was thinking it would be good to claim a bit of space there, close to the stage, while her friends had run off to do something else. Kerrin came by once in a while and said hello and left her stuff with me. Rasputina played. The last time I had seen them they had been promoting their album of covers, so hadn’t done many of their original tunes. So, even going by setlist alone, this show was superior. After the lights had gone up, Kerrin came over: “Are you driving back to Noho now?” “Yeah,” I said. “Oh,” she replied, “Because I was going to ask if you wanted to hang out while I interview the band. ” The interview was in the little backstage area to the side of the stage. Zoë Keating was really approachable, and Melora Creager was exhausted-looking but accommodating. Then Kerrin had to stop in to talk with… the wife of the singer of that opening act? And whomever else. At that pizza place on the corner. Then the cold walk back to my car. She gave me directions to her apartment and she’d made it clear that I had to come in so I could remind her of something she had to email to herself. Then she put on a Cirque du Soleil DVD and we both fell asleep on the couch. But I woke up and couldn’t fall back to sleep, so got my boots on and she told me how to get back to the Turnpike. At home I thought to nap, but couldn’t. Tina called me and said I should come over, she was cooking, but I fell back asleep and by the time I got there she was gone. I bought a newspaper for the classifieds. Ran into Amy, the local, who said she’d buy me Thai food, but all I wanted was white rice and that Thai iced tea she ordered for me. I forget what we talked about. 18 I was at a party that Polly and Kevin threw when I met another Robyn. She was a basketball player. She said she had seen me at the Eels show recently. Although at the beginning of the party I was mostly involved in a conversation with Kay (who was upset about something involving Smarf and another woman), this Robyn eventually (and rather aggressively) said, “Hey. I want to know about you,” and began to ask me questions. She said, I hear that you’re a musician, are you any good? I answered No, not at all. She said she heard I made CDs. Albums of demos, really, I said. I had a copy of my most recent, Harmony of the Worlds, with me, so I gave that to her. I guess I could blame the wine, but she was also a very intimidating, dominating figure. There I was, talking about things that shouldn’t be talked about. Talking about other people we both knew. I told her about Ethics class because oh that must be interesting. And she asked why it was that somebody could find it so attractive to watch two guys get it on. And I said blah blah well you see here’s what I think about human sexuality blah theory blah. That’s how I react to people saying things like that. And then she said that she had had a dream about me. I had found a boyfriend and I was so happy. She was so happy for me. and you know what? She whispered in my ear, I saw Caela. I made her repeat. She repeated: I saw Caela. From your dreams. I paused. A deep breath. I said, I believe you about the dream, sure, but I don’t believe that was Caela you saw. She’s, um… somewhere you can’t go. Are you from… She said she wasn’t from the future, but people talk. And we were on the loveseat rather than the sofa when she started talking about how she just needed to be free, she thought it was very possible to love more than one person at once. And I said If you’re so interested in me, let’s go back to my apartment. See my apartment, and she kissed me a little and I said I don’t want us to be having this conversation here please let’s go to Dunkin’ Donuts or something and she said well how about just out to the steps and I said okay let’s go out to the steps and I’m sure we were physically close, she was probably holding onto me. She quoted a song of mine and at this point I just laughed and said see? What the fuck. How could you ever have heard that song? I haven’t let anyone listen to that song, but that was my song, and we’ve never met before. Then she invited me back to her place and I said sure	and then Smarf was there coming over and saying Oh are our plans canceled then and she said No and had one arm around each of us and soon it was Well why can’t I spend the night with both of you and he said, I don’t think I’m up for that happening again… but, okay, I guess. I’d rather it was just with you. Damn girl, you really like the two man thing and she was, Yeah, well, there’s nothing wrong with that and it continued a little until I said to this basketball-playing Robyn, He just wants you. I’m going home and got my coat and she stood up and gave me an unrestrained kiss and said, What are you doing tomorrow? and I said, I dunno, but I feel like I’ll see you around, and I went home. In the morning I walked and saw Zella, who said, “Robyn called to get your number but I said I didn’t have it” and I said, “Oh, you know her?” And she said, “Yeah, we all know Robyn,” and I walked more and came home and Rick said, “Robyn called and she’s coming over and hopes you’ll be here. ” And I went and spent the night at my mom’s place, feeling I had done something wrong. 19 Jonny invited me to The Thirsty Mind and started talking about the new Robyn. “I hear that you’re hanging out with her, and I don’t know how serious it is yet, but… I had some experiences with her, and I just want to mention them. ” He was on one couch and I was on the other. “Like, she tried to kill me once,” he said. “What do you mean by that?” “Like, she put her arms around my throat and said she was going to kill me. ” “That’s… terrifying,” I said. “No, I just met her at a party. ” I said that I would stay away from her. He went on to talk about his plans to move to Florida for recording school. 20 When you get so close to the future it’s like the end of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link: after you’ve defeated Gannon, you fight your own shadow for the Triforce. 21 I couldn’t sleep last night, so I watched the entire first season of The Upright Citizens Brigade, after playing the open mic and thinking: Do you folksingers know about rebellion? Sometimes, it’s not destructive at all. Sometimes, rebellion is the creation of beauty in the one place where no one wants to look— a sculpture made of pieces from trash. 22 So I’m there with the head of the English department at Greenfield Community College and the guy who seems to run around all day frantically making decisions about unorthodox credit-granting situations. My score on the CLEP test, which should have proven that I didn’t need to take (and which should have given me credit for) English Comp 1 was a 48. The recommended minimum for credit-granting was a 50. I didn’t understand how this happened. The test had seemed like a piece of cake. Probably my writing for the essay portion (the required length of which was never specified) had been too brief. “No, it would be a bad precedent to give credit for that,” says the head of the English department. Yes, certainly. But I already have credit for English Comp 2. Kind of a long story. I was enrolled in HCC’s equivalent to the actual course of English Comp 1, but I was finding it too slow, so I took and passed the test for English Comp 2… but then I dropped English Comp 1. “And, also, we decided as a department not to accept credit for the test for English Comp 2… because someone in the department always needed to grade the essay portion, and there was a question about who it would be and how they’d be compensated for having to do that extra work. ” So… I have credit for neither English Comp 1 nor English comp 2? They look at my transcripts. “But wait a minute… you took an English class here for which English Comp 1 + 2 were prerequisites? You shouldn’t have been allowed to do that. You were misadvised. What was your grade?” “An A minus. ” “Oh boy. ” I was told to re-take the test for English Comp 1 and to pass it this time. And that once I had passed it I could get a letter from the teacher of my 200-level class, explaining why the program requirement of English Comp 2 should be waived. Then the head of the English Department would approve that and a committee or the Dean or somebody would review it and most likely okay it. 23 I was on the steps that led to Alix’s apartment when I felt like I was in a story again. Our upper bodies leaned against each other. We smoked cigarettes. I wanted to prepare that speech for my community college class. I wanted to put on a dress and kiss people at Haven. Wants were circling around my head like animated stars of confusion. At least for now, I was in a story again. My visit to Boston had been the back story. Having had the ways and the means, as well as an extended weekend of MLK Day observance, I had taken up Kerrin’s offer of a visit. A request of an employee of the Park Plaza Hotel, for a payphone, had led me into the lobby, among an assortment of geeks, folks in Ren garb, and gothy types. Instead of reaching Kerrin’s phone I had heard a pre-recorded voice’s recitation of some alphanumeric code. Some of the strangers in the elevator with me had been exiting at the eighth floor, so I had guessed/had faith that Kerrin would also be on the eighth floor. She had been there, waiting to use the elevator. “How did you know to find me here?” and I just shrugged. Then was brunch with live jazz and a guy that she had brought along (who had footed the bill then taken the T home), back to the hotel for the tearing down of the convention’s art gallery, where her creations had been hanging. The spotting of western Mass acquaintances, but no real talk with them. Kerrin’s couch in Cambridge, watching Blade II on digital cable, my falling asleep, her cuddles next to me, a morning’s awakening, relocation to her bedroom, she had needed more sleep but I hadn’t been tired, so Starbucks and a morning paper, the Mass Avenue Restaurant, using the keys to her apartment, a book about the sexual revolution in her living room, the ring on her cell phone, an attempt to stifle eavesdropping tendencies, the call of my name, a request for a ride to do laundry while she had walked groggily in only underpants and the earpiece (attached by wire) to her cell, pulling the car up to the laundromat door, a strange man: “Do you speak English? Roll down your window more, you’ll like this”, so I had rolled up my window and looked in the other direction, the cartoon show Ed, Edd n Eddy on the television, need for a cigarette, the same strange man asking what strange men always ask: what to do when a woman won’t shut up? “She stops to ask for directions when you know the way to go, then you say turn right but she turns left and drives you off a cliff and the next thing you know you’re up in Heaven!”, my reply: “Then, somebody’s finally shown you the way to Heaven, right?”, my cigarette thrown into the snow, the door behind me, Kerrin’s long-distance primary in the doorway of an unfamiliar house while she had been discussing “legal matters” into her cell, they had gone then to a bedroom, the man who lived in the house and another woman, photos from a gothic cruise, pleasantries, the exit of long-distance primary, cinnamon buns, episodes of South Park in AVI format on the computer monitor, sitting in the canopy bed, hours of South Park, unloading the car at her apartment after the sun had set, dinner—pizza—which she pays for, I-90 West. My room’s light had burned out when I had attempted to turn it on after my return to Northampton. I had set the alarm to awaken and to prepare a speech for class. I had turned off the alarm in my sleep. I had felt terrible guilt. School was necessary. This was my plan, my one year plan! Lament, coffee, the Internet, worry, wallet (empty), meeting Tina, Harvey was with her, they had seemed so good to see all of a sudden growing older and different like they had started to be drawn by a new artist with a distinct style, Packards, a man I hadn’t recognized who had talked about heroin, Alix’s apartment. On second thought, I was tired. Where had the day gone? Shouldn’t I have been preparing for class? 24 I delivered my speech for class more effectively than I had thought, although my awkwardness, playing with my hair, pausing for a deep sigh, meant that my grade was a B+. (The missed speech from before would be made up in front of her next semester’s class. ) Hoog from Bart’s, who is in my class, said, “It was like, ‘He’s fidgeting, but that’s just how Levi is!’” She had been sitting in front of me all throughout this three-week long mega-condensed semester. Then the semester was over. I warmed up the car for a little bit and took off. I had things to do, like apply to colleges and go to the bank to make sure the checks I had sent were going to clear. Preparing food and making sure the sink wasn’t going to overflow with too many dishes. And how was my room? Was it clean? Did I still have frankincense and myrrh? Was there another email from my father? I replied to those now, and I was making him happy. And if I didn’t take those vitamin supplements the coffee and macaroni wasn’t enough to make me go. I was supposed to meet… somebody… zzzzzzzzz. And when I awoke it was 11 PM but someone wanted to hang out anyway. Brianna, from Smith College, who had actually been reminding me that we really should get together sometime. Which was good, but our awkwardness was about equal when she entertained my company in her dorm room and we chatted. We had kissed once, months back, and she’d said I was her third—third kiss—with apologies if she wasn’t very good at it. And at Alix’s, I started to dream (?) of Jonny’s voice, as he said in melody, “Alix… having sex with Levi!” and also in the maybe-dream he was communicating from downstairs, saying something about being up in three seconds and then Alix said, “Yes, I expect you up here in exactly three seconds” and there was the sound of his boots taking the steps three at a time while Alix and I laughed at his zany ways… but then I felt myself in the bed again and I imagined that Alix had left to talk to Jonny outside, so I looked over to see whether she was still there next to me and she was. Then Jonny knocked at the door in reality and Alix left to talk to him outside. His stay was brief and full of laughter (except when he talked about Basketball Robyn), and I thought that I heard Alix and Jonny kissing goodbye after I had crawled back into bed. Not that I minded if they were kissing, but I would want to make fun of them. I should have kissed her when she returned to bed. Then I would have known. 25 Tina prepared a dish of potatoes that were covered by cheese and bacon, and we ate it, and her kitty got a little bit of bacon, too. I put on a tie and skirt while she dolled herself up, and she called for directions to Konstruct in Springfield. The night had been running four weeks in a row and this was my first time going. It had been about that long since I’d been to a goth night at all. The initial feeling, walking into one of those places, was usually of comfort. Everyone was covered by vinyl looking so loud smoking their clove cigarettes right next to each other up close giving backrubs while candles burned drinking alcohol in the dark while the music was like what the music always was like, controlling you, telling you what to do. I knew mostly everyone there. Tried to sit and stay in one place and let the night come to me as much as possible. I hugged, squishing beautiful women against me as part of the night, as usual, then got angry when men gave me looks of congratulations, then I tried to plot out some great bold social move, some words to say that would make things happen and shove my social life out of its stagnation. Alix showed up, drunken and confused, asking, “How did I end up at a goth club in Springfield?” (Jonny had dropped her off; she had thought he’d be coming too but he wasn’t. ) I kissed her on the dance floor and implied that I wanted to be the one who could drive her home, so on the way back Tina was in the backseat and after dropping her off I held Alix in the car for a while before asking if I could stay over. I wanted to fall asleep in her arms. "

    "title": "XI. The One Year Plan (26-41)",
    "body": "26 The first week of Spring classes was odd, all momentum but leading where? Routines weren’t established yet as the professor said, “Let’s learn each other’s names” as if I was ever going to remember them. Lydia was a student now, only for one class but as always she threw herself into this new endeavor, so was also working the photo lab, and asking me how I was doing, to which I had to reply that I’m fine, just taking a big courseload this semester, I’m graduating you know, and I’m applying to four-year schools… …which was true, although so far I had only formally applied to one college, in California, a state which was being governed by a Hollywood action hero who had originally achieved notoriety for being muscular and for speaking English with a strong Austrian accent that people found funny. Yes, yes, more preparations needed to be done as part of my One Year Plan, though really, I was juggling a lot. Botany was taught by an old man who fit the word “nifty” into his lectures and called the term cytoplasm “high-falutin’” because it wasn’t inclusive of a cell’s nucleus, as the term protoplasm was. The professor for Human Ecology strove to run the class in as non-hierarchical a fashion as possible and so began with an exercise in consensus decision-making. (We needed to decide by consensus three to five principles of community that we would strive to apply over the duration of the course. It proved difficult for the class to decide by consensus whether “consensus decision-making” itself should be one of these principles, so we failed to reach a decision by the end of the class period. ) Fellow students in my Women in American History course included an herbally-minded dropout/former U. S. traveler named Ginny and Thaddius, a dark-haired boy who, during introductions to the rest of the class, rattled off a list of a dozen or so history courses that he had taken at various institutions. He asked me after class whether I was driving south, and I said sure. I asked him where he was from and he said he had been to here and back and there and then to somewhere else and then he had gone crazy and then he had tried to recover but had only found toxic tap water. He explained that his presentations for Public Speaking class had been regarding the topic of vivisection, and said that he didn’t want to live with roommates again because last time he literally kept finding anarchists in the closet. 27 Going to Haven the night after going to Konstruct… well, that was a decision that came from a sleep-deprived mindset, feeling cool and thinking I’d just go there, sip leisurely on drinks, and chat casually with old friends as I saw them. Which turned out to be the case, except that I had a table of folks who were keen on accosting me as I passed, and a guy rather a bit larger than I who finally got me to snap when he compared my appearance to that of Michael Jackson and then left. I approached. He was gushing to some friends about the cleverness of his insult. I asked if he had a problem with me that would like to explain. He said no and left again. “You don’t deserve that shit,” said Zella of the matter, instant messaging from her new place in Allston (in greater Boston). 	“I know,” I said. “I don’t even know why it happened. What did I do?” 28 Britta called to propose that we hang out. Unexpectedly, Ian, the gay porn model who at Haven had been among the table of people that so lauded my ridicule, accompanied her. Her friend Becca from Smith College also joined the table. I agreed to be Britta’s date to the Dresden Dolls concert the following Tuesday. (In discussing this upcoming show all of my roommates, being part of the New England goth scene, had expressed surprise that I had not seem they play before. ) I wasn’t sure what to make of the attention Britta was paying me. She was an Art History major, made no secret of her privileged background, and seemed compelled to associate with every person she thought might be worth knowing in this town. She was almost too much of a character to be believed—a party hostess for small town dropouts, a proto-sophisticate mixing with radicals yet never claiming to be other than what her conservative background prepared her to be. Although I didn’t know what her intentions with me were, she was off-kilter enough that I trusted her. 29 Friday. Math class was an overview of methods for vote counting. At home I continued to research cities and their public universities. Despite the fact that it was a drivable distance from my father’s life in South Carolina, Atlanta had enough going for it that I drove down to Chicopee and used my mom’s credit card to apply to Georgia State. I drove back north and watched The Simpsons with Alix. She and I also played some Boggle and had another one of our vague talks in which I said, “Okay, so let’s talk again about the nature of our relationship” but then nothing was ever clarified. In the morning I returned home, where the dishes were overflowing in the sink (my fault) and the living room was a mess (not my fault) but the bathroom was looking okay (Katie had been doing well with that). I was also a mess, I hadn’t showered and where was my hairbrush? But by IM Alix informed me that she was awake and heading to Haymarket and that I was invited. Also, Britta had informed the readership of her LiveJournal that she’d be there all day, so I figured I could go for another cup of morning coffee. 30 In the car I finished smoking my cigarette before I walked down the street in the direction of the house in Easthampton where the party was at (“The Spiral Gallery”) and the sky was refreshingly clear as seems like a rarity sometimes in our winter, and everybody’s best friend Orion was overlooking the house that sat back a certain distance from the road on which I’d parked. The music could be heard only faintly as I approached, which I found impressive because I knew they had set up the basement as a sort of private nightclub with a DJ, a bar, and a thumping sound system. There was Tina with her most recent ex-boyfriend, standing in the kitchen. She gave me a tour of the place, which I appreciated so didn’t stop even though she was mistaken in assuming I hadn’t been there before. (Oddly enough, Kerrin, the Boston-area resident I met through LiveJournal, had stayed here during her last visit to the Pioneer Valley. ) The downstairs was gorgeous. I was on the younger end of the age spectrum. The partygoers were mostly of a gothy kinky pagan-y demographic. Hippie Craig, who “really enjoys” me “but is shy”, read my tarot after vibe-synching, rocking back and forth and sticking the cards right into my face pointing at the illustrations then saying, “Remember! Take this with a grain of salt! It’s been a while since I’ve done this!” and his friend was a shy but approachable woman with a philosophy degree, and Graff said that meditation and remembering his spirituality had gained him inner peace and allowed him to overcome, oh, for example, his general disdain for people like Hippie Craig. Augusta drank too much and spoke of confusion while sitting on logs of wood in the smoking porch. The guy who had only recently gotten onto my social radar (by getting onstage at a musical open mic and reading poetry) (always looking like an artist, lost, spiraling downward), who had also been in front of BankNorth selling artwork, showed up and it was his art that was on the wall but no one would have guessed it from the way he lay back incapacitated by substance on the couch and seeming angry at the world wanting to lash out at anyone else, but I kept saying hello and asking him about his artwork. Meanwhile, Lydia was shamelessly cuddling up to attractive women… …attractive women, whom the men liked to talked about. Nim said that one of the downsides to a relationship was, once he got to a party like this, it seemed like what’s the point? because nothing was going to happen with anyone. They were just casual conversations that I had, with various parties, and the time passed quickly, and when I left the party at 4 in the morning, I thought, I had been there that long? Wow. 31 Schoolwork. Applying to colleges. Applying to jobs. Trying to keep the house in decent shape before the party that was happening the next week. Patrick had asked to have his birthday party at Alix’s, but the only people who came, really, were people Alix and Jonny had invited. He spat beer in my face (a “joke” for which he apologized) and then hid for a while, then left to go to the party that Basketball Robyn was having for another friend’s birthday party. (Jonny was particularly displeased about this. ) 32 Jan. 26, 2004. A couple years ago, I couldn’t sleep one night, so I posted an online quiz on LiveJournal that got pretty well circulated—the What Should Your New Year’s Resolution Be? Quiz… but what’s funny is, I completely missed that it got onto NBC news in a “high tech talk” feature. I just found the streaming video to prove it. This got me curious, so I googled for other notable links to that quiz: -Newswatch 12 in Northern Michigan -busyparentsonline. com -An editor’s column at firstscience. com -A site that says “Proven, highly effective techniques - seduce ! Please click the links below for more information…” -A Brazilian site that says:  Semelhantes aos velhos caderninhos de perguntas, porém muito menos água com açúcar, alguns dos testes surpreendem tanto nos resultados como nos objetivos. Há os que investigam ‘qual deveria ser sua resolução de ano novo’, passando por ‘que drink é você’ ou ‘qual celebridade teen combina mais com você?’. (Translated from Portuguese this means, uh, I don’t know Portuguese. ) -A newsletter for customers of an Internet service provider in Auckland, New Zealand (viewable in pdf format on their site). -The Good News Web Designers Association, an “ecumenical gathering of Christian webmasters who are interested in sharing questions, answers and other resources in the field of Web design” who say:  While people’s minds are on making resolutions for the new year, use your website(s) to guide them. Provide tips or tools for discerning God’s will. Here are links that show how other websites are helping people with their resolution making and keeping. Analyze how they were designed and why it’s appealing. Then add the Christian element and use your God-given creativity to add a new webpage to your site! 33 Kerrin arrives, gives me her sleek coat. Gives me one of the two earpieces to her mp3 player, so we listen to the same songs, walking to my car. Then she gets a call on her cell and I get to pick the music. This arrangement continues until we reach our destination, and waiting for a table to get Japanese food, I’m still in someone else’s coat and listening to someone else’s music. For the moment I’m somewhere else, someone else, but it feels just as genuine as any other scene. 34 Mar. 9, 2004. I called Alix last night while she was out gothing with Dark-haired Jill, the gal I joke is her new girlfriend. I said that if she was going to be awake when she got back she should call me. I don’t know why I did that. I sounded like a fool. Tonight I called Charlie. His social disappearance was something I didn’t take very seriously at first. As time passed, though, and as people started telling me that they had tried to call him only to find that he was saying nothing and politely refusing to see anyone… The sound of his voice brought me back. He took my number, claiming that he’d call back when he felt better. I asked him if he was sick. He said that he wasn’t. At the end of the call, I said “Bye, Charlie” and he said, “Bye, hon. ” I have much homework to do tonight. Would that it were only some books to read! But no, I have writing assignments and whatnot. 35 The days can pass by so easily now without my noticing that I haven’t written a journal entry. What’s new? My most recent memory is feeling stressed out, going over to Alix’s, getting a hug and then exhaling. For someone who spends so much time alone, I really have a fascinatingly intense way of not relaxing except in certain company. It turns out spring break is next week for me. I had no idea. I’ll spend some time in Boston. I’ve already got some roughly sketched plans with Kerrin. Maybe I’ll get to visit Zella again too. I haven’t seem Rick or Bryan much lately, even though they’re my roommates. It’s funny how all of us here seem to go through these different lifestyle phases. I just want to know if the giant cardboard boxes, in which Rick got his new computer, contain any materials he needs to keep, or if I can just get them out of the living room. I suppose I could look inside and use my judgment, huh? It’s funny. What bugs me about cleaning up after roommates isn’t the ‘principle of the matter’, it’s that, growing up, I hated when my mother would clean up after me and throw out stuff I wanted or otherwise put things where I wouldn’t find them, and I hate to do that to my roommates. I like that this is a household in which pretty much we do what we want and don’t get on each other’s backs. I just shooed Buddha from the sink again. Mandy added me back to her friends list after some span of time and messaged me to say like hey so yeah. I’ve learned of my first rejected college application. I figure I’ll get in somewhere, though. Wal-Mart was supposed to call me today to schedule a drug test. It seemed like I had been given the green light. Weird. It’s not like I would know how to call such a big place and say, “Hey, did you forget about me?” which is somewhat troubling. 36 I woke up for class this morning. Arrived at the campus before I realized that all the rushing had been to unintentionally arrive an hour early. I should pay more attention to the hour hands of clocks. Math class, then to Chicopee. I went to my high school. I needed to be buzzed in—a new security measure. I walked toward the office I needed to visit. “Yo, don’t walk like that, you look like a gay,” I was told by a student in the hallway. I got my transcripts (as required for one of my transfer applications). Ate at Bernie’s Dining Depot, saying hello to my mother and to my Pepé (grandfather), who were both at work there. Went for an oil change. Found out that my car was leaking gasoline, so went to my mom’s house to wait for Bruce to come home and take control of the situation, as he loves to do in these sorts of matters. Napped. Was told that I could take my mom’s car that night if needed. Sarah X. wanted to hang. She was in a good mood, having been admitted to her top choice for art school. I invited Alix to come along. We three went to the Whately Diner. It was good. Then we watched Sylvia, the Sylvia Plath movie, in my living room, while drinking from a big bottle of vodka. This was, of course, depressing, until all my roommates came home with a crowd of people and started a miniature dance party to “Hey Ya!” 37 Some kid now just sat next to me, asked if I knew where he could get some weed, and proceeded to attempt small talk by discussing the inadequacies of this diner’s employees. This sort of thing annoys me now more than it used to. 38 I woke up in the early afternoon, I suppose. I chatted with Alix online. Said I thought I’d start making the rounds of potential employers again. This means re-applying to the fast food places I already tried to woo a couple months ago. She suggested that I write a resumé. I’m afraid of resumés. I asked if she’d help me. She said yeah. So with her help I designed a resumé. By then it was getting dark. We had pizza and ice cream. I read stuff for my classes while she slept. Then I slept. I woke up today, had some coffee, then went home. An unsealed envelope had been left in the mailbox. My name was on the front. That couldn’t be good. It said that someone had arrived either to collect payment for the gas bill or to disconnect the service. Crap. So I called them. Hadn’t I sent out a check for it? They hadn’t received one. I walked to my bank, got a detailed printout of my transactions over the past month. I had sent out two payments for my credit card and neglected to send out the gas bill. I guess I’ll have to find some way to keep track of what I’ve spent, eh? Like, balancing a checkbook. I used to do that. I should be doing more every day, and it occupies me until I relent and decide I need to relax, no matter what, for the evening or whatever. I’m always behind somewhere. The absurdity of this apartment plays into that. Someone went grocery shopping like two weeks ago and left some Tupperware, paper towels, etc. in the plastic bags, which are there still, on the floor next to the sink. Now the garbage is spilling out onto it. I forgot to come home last night to take the trash out, because, in a household of four, I’m the only one who’ll ever do it. But here’s what I’ll do right now: I don’t have the funds to pay off the entirety of the gas bill, now, but I can get the “overdue balance” paid so they don’t disconnect it. I can do that over the phone today. I will eat too much ramen instead of eating too many frozen pizzas. No, scratch that. I can’t really cut much from my lifestyle, expense-wise, except maybe my food budget by $15/wk. and my coffee budget by like $10/wk. I’ll beg from my father, explaining how hard I’ve been studying. Today will be a run-run-run day. Call gas company, pay them, eat something, hopefully find some paper in my room, print out resumés, check newspaper ads for job listings, wander wherever and drop off resumés thoughtlessly (backtrack: shave and shower first) then once it’s dark I can come home, do dishes, gather up dirty laundry and take it to my Mom’s (cheaper than the laundromat) and do homework while I’m there. And research this whole Joint Admissions program that will get me into a Massachusetts public college in the case that no one else accepts me. I can keep myself busy like this thanks to the free time of Spring break, up until Wednesday night, and hopefully then begin my getaway in the Boston area, which will last a few days. Then I can come back, resume frantic stuff, and, yeah. 39 Well, I’m fed and cleaned, but after finally getting my printer to load paper (why do printers hate me so much?) I learned that I’m out of ink. So, no resumés for me today. I guess I can print them out at my Mom’s place while I’m there. Then do that hunting tomorrow. 40 Laundry went well. Mom and Bruce are moved almost entirely into the upstairs, which (prior to extensive renovation) used to be my space. (Memé and Pepé have moved in downstairs. ) They left to do groceries and I practiced my songs, playing guitar standing in the living room looking perplexed into the mirror—I couldn’t have imagined putting a mirror there! My Smurfs chalkboard had been hanging on a nail there instead. I came home and started to do dishes, but stopped due to an odd feeling in my abdomen. When I feel hurt or sick I like to think happy thoughts until I’m better. It saves me money. 41 Tuesday was lots of running around, getting cleaning done and all that. At night I went over Alix’s, we ate pizza, watched all the late night talk shows until they started to rerun them, somewhere in there things getting kissy. Got an IM Wednesday from Helena. She’s got a publication coming up. I’m glad that she tells me about this upcoming publication, then signs off without saying goodbye; it’s her trademark. Now I’m at Zella’s place in Brookline, outside of Boston. Amelia is here, too, which is funny because we both happened to arrange to visit Zella on the same day a few weeks ago, too. I haven’t been able to fall asleep next to her, though. (Zella is in bed with her roommate, while Amelia and I have Zella’s bed for the night. ) Some people are just hard for me to fall asleep next to—usually people I like but don’t think I’ll ever be close to. It’s not a trust issue… I think it’s more an “energy thing”. So, I’m on the hardwood living room floor. The Guy On The Couch is asleep on the couch. People in the upstairs apartment are walking around, I can hear. The kitty here is very friendly, and meows at me. Kerrin asked to see me early, but I wanted to allocate some time to visiting here, and I already had made plans anyway. I’m seeing her tonight, and she has miscellaneous plans for us over the next four days. Not much celebration was happening in this particular apartment for St. Patrick’s Day. We watched Boondock Saints. Amelia and I drank some Guinness. Pleasant enough. "

    "body": "42 “I apologize for being emotionally distant,” said Kerrin as I was dropping her off at Mark’s place. She was going there to get her stuff and have a conversation with him. “I’m not sure if that’s making you feel bad, but I figure it probably is. ” She said she didn’t expect the talk to last more than twenty minutes. I’m not assuming that this will be the case. She’ll take as long as she needs to take. The remainder of my time at Zella’s was pretty okay. We went to the Garment District, I got some stuff. I asked Zella to comment on the topic of age disparities within same-sex relationships, and she was so into discussing this that I proposed she should make a State of the Sex Life Address. She did. That lasted about a half hour, maybe more, while Amelia, The Guy On The Couch and I listened. 43 I just made the mistake of speaking in the men’s room, here inside this bar, while I wait for Kerrin. It was a small restroom, with an open toilet (no stall) plus two urinals. A man was at the urinal. “I felt like I was busting in on somebody, by coming into here,” I said. At first he didn’t respond, which I didn’t take offense to. I knew that talking to strangers at the urinal is usually a bad idea. But then he formulated a slurred response: “That’s okay, I’m a virgin. No place better to do it than in the bathroom at [whatever the name of this bar is], I know we just met but I think you and me, we’re forever. ” If I ever get desperate, I think I’d have more luck with the sexually repressed frat boys in a sports bar than I ever would at a gay club. 44 I finally walked back to where we had parked. First I noticed the sign to the parking lot—”No parking after midnight, violators will be towed”—then I noticed that my car was gone. Fortunately, I had asked Kerrin to point out the exact house she was going to. Looking at the mailbox for names, I determined the correct apartment number. I heard her voice through the apartment door, but it sounded like she was on her way out. I went to the porch and lit a cigarette. She found me when I was two drags into it. “Oh, hey!” she said, cheerfully. “Hi,” I replied, “My car’s gone. ” “Oh, shit. ” No tow company number was listed on the parking lot signs, so we walked to some bar and asked the guys at the door. We got a number for the “Boston Tow Line”, which gave us the numbers for two different tow lots. The first one we tried had my car. We started walking. As we passed some restaurant we ran into one of Kerrin’s friends. Kerrin promoted her upcoming birthday party—infinite margaritas, truth or dare, spin the bottle, twister, strip poker!—and then we continued along our way. 45 A few guys ahead of us in line said, “They got you too, huh?” It sounded like they had been out drinking. I went to the window after the guy in front of me had paid $100, and then I learned that this place was CASH ONLY. Pure evil! So we walked to the Store 24 for an ATM. As I waited in line (because I also needed to buy cigarettes and a Twix bar) the folks behind us were being happy-rowdy. I wasn’t paying attention, but Kerrin assured me that we may as well have walked into an independent film. (Appropriate enough: I had just commented that we were Jay and Silent Bob when a car had nearly backed into me, and Kerrin had yelled “What the fuck?!”, etc. , at the driver, while I had just made a face and stood by. ) By the time we made it back to Kerrin’s apartment we were both tense and exhausted. We had to clean ourselves up before bed… but I sat on the steps outside the front of the building, by myself, with a cigarette, leaning my head against the wall, eventually closing my eyes, trying to change my thoughts from “words” to “pictures”, meanwhile exhaling in sighs of subtle and silent release, as nobody walked by and the snow from days past rested calmly on the hoods of automobiles or gathered where scratched and battered street signs stating parking bans and once-per-month street cleanings had somehow and at some time been planted. One hundred dollars for a tow! I could have panicked, would have wanted to cry at another time. Fucking cars. But I had a feeling this all meant nothing at all, I was letting go, and thinking back to Northampton, two months remaining of school, three and a half months remaining on the lease. I ashed my cigarette. I was feeling better, but still occasionally tense. A habitual tensing of my gut. I breathed. I went through my things, which had been placed in the closet, gathering bathroom supplies. Kerrin came to me and put her arms around my torso, just as I had wanted her to. “You know what you need, more than to get clean? Cuddles. ” We were on the couch. When changing position to get more comfortable, she had to talk about it. We showered. She washed my back. As we lay on her mattress to fall asleep, here’s an approximation of what was said: She: “What are you looking for in our relationship?” Me: “I’m hoping we can grow to really understand each other…” “Wait,” she interrupted, “I thought you didn’t think people could really understand each other. ” “Well, not ultimately. I’m saying, like, within the limits of… I mean, to the degree, almost, well, as well as people can…” “See,” she said, “But I do think that it’s possible for people to understand each other completely, and that that progresses on an intuitive, emotional, and psychic level. ” “Yes! See, I know what you mean, but we’re totally talking about different things. When you talk about ‘understanding’ I default to a rational interpretation, pinning things into words…” “They’re the same thing. ” “No, what I would have been talking about would have been a paradigm that completely ignored outside components, the intuitive, the emotional. If we’re to talk about emotional communication… and… coalescence, that’s different. ” “Uh, okay, maybe if I weren’t so close to sleep I would be able to understand what you’re saying, but now isn’t the time for it. ” 46 The alarm on her cell phone went off. We hadn’t slept for long—four hours, maybe. I left in somewhat of a hurry, before she was even out of bed. I feared that she was going to stay lying down until she desperately needed a ride in order to get to work on time. I was very not up to the task of driving first thing in the morning after four hours of sleep before my first cup of coffee, in Boston. I got my caffeine fix at La Luna Caffé, and once I was awake started driving towards Salem. In the case that no college accepts me, my back-up comes from the Joint Admissions program—once I have an Associate’s from a Massachusetts Community College I’m guaranteed admission into one of the state’s public colleges/universities—so I figured I’d check out Salem State to see if there’s any chance I could stand it. I wandered through some of the buildings. It seemed pretty isolated as well as small. Probably not the best fit for me. This was my first time seeing Salem. There was even more witch-related stuff than I’d expected. I found my way from Salem to Brookline without issue. I rule! I parked out front of Zella’s. Tried calling, but she’s not awake yet. I just ate some pizza. I’ve got a whole afternoon to spend. Doing what, I’m not sure. 47 I walked to a video store. They had Motorama, which was, for me, one of those crazy films you happen to see on Showtime at 3 AM That you later wonder if your mind just hallucinated. So I got a membership, rented that, and threw in Henry and June, too. I went to Zella’s. The Guy On The Couch buzzed me in. Zella was still asleep, so I started watching the movies. 48 When I finally located Kerrin and her friend Gregor, the challenge was to find a chair. They were eating at a Japanese restaurant. That wouldn’t fill up my tummy satisfactorily, although I was being offered some of their sushi. Kerrin didn’t seem to be paying attention to me. I was slightly annoyed. They wanted to go to New York City—speeding down the highway until we reached the Bat Cave, was the plan. After all, in NYC the clubs stayed open until five in the morning. At Kerrin’s we all took turns taking showers. I put on my makeup while she dressed herself. “No one will be able to see that,” she said of my subtle eyeshadow. We stopped at Gregor’s. His roommates had all been drinking. There was some commotion while he got dressed, and I was already beginning to act the way I used to act in preparation for goth clubs. I was feeling it, excited by it, thinking that it would be a return to form. Gregor drove quickly, weaving in and out of traffic. This was practical in Boston, but I was slightly concerned by it when he continued driving like that on the highway. Kerrin popped what was thought to be ecstasy. Gregor popped something unknown. No one had talked about the person driving us to NYC being on drugs. Eventually, Gregor’s driving started to be erratic. He wasn’t staying between the lines. He almost steered us into the side of the highway. Kerrin warned him and eased the wheel in the opposite direction. She suggested that he should park at the next exit. Would I drive? “Absolutely!” I said. Of course, then I realized that this car had a manual transmission. Still, though, what else could be done? Kerrin didn’t have a driver’s license. I got some accelerated lessons in usage of the clutch, then got on the highway and drove us into New York. Gregor took over once we were in the city. It was past 5 AM, too late to go out dancing anymore, so we just looked for a place to eat. We probably spent an hour searching Manhattan for a good restaurant and a good parking space. People are so weird. I would have just parked wherever and eaten wherever. The restaurant experience was good. Conversation was humorous. Then Gregor started driving again, but only just barely got out of the city before he wanted to park us at a rest stop for a while. 49 We stopped in Providence. They wanted to get food. It was at some seafood place. They got it to go—they wanted to eat inside the cinema while we saw a movie, but the movie wasn’t playing, so they ate outside. Cold air blew around us on this, the day of the Spring Equinox. Then back to the Boston area. A couple hours in a coffee shop. They conversed with strangers at tables nearby. A small child was walking around. Then it was just some time spent sitting at Kerrin’s place, cleaning up, getting ready for the night’s plans—a birthday party and a “debauchery party”. While we were parking, Kerrin ran out of the car to hug Bluejay. What! I know that person! Bluejay was up visiting from Baltimore with their boyfriend. The party was small. Most everybody knew everyone else and there was only one conversation going on at a time while a movie played. The Mummy? I didn’t want to watch that. I drank some wine. The guy who sat at the computer remixing rap songs responded nicely when I initiated chatter. The main conversation, though, wasn’t for me. It was gossip about people I didn’t know. I just sat around, listening to the talk. The topic changed to sex and just seemed like the same old story. Bi Poly Pagans or not, it was all gender roles and rationalizing why everyone else’s sexual proclivities were wrong. That was what I thought, being out of the conversation, stewing on my own. I know better than to get self-righteous, judging strangers in any regard—if I had jumped into the talk with my own respectful but confident commentary, or, as might have been more appropriate, a joke that implied my sentiments—maybe I would have heard things that I related to better. Whatever. I cut myself off at that point in my analysis. I was in a set of circumstances leading me to formulate, dwell on, and elaborate on, negative thoughts. I went for a walk in the rain. Got lost and enjoyed it. Came back forty-five minutes later. “We’re not leaving until you’ve dried off,” said Kerrin. I was also out of cigarettes and so I don’t even know what weak words I mumbled. More quickly than I had expected, dwelling on the negatives, Kerrin said her goodbyes so that we could leave. 50 Walking down the halls of this community college, dark halls, empty ones, here first thing in the morning, the students haven’t arrived… But back to Kerrin, let’s finish up that story arc. People who put too much stock in biology make me uneasy. Me, I need to see the practical applications of placing labels on component parts of organisms. It seems no more substantial to say “this is bone marrow” than it would seem to say “Honey, I named a star after you”, until that isolation of marrow is put to clearly good use. But the way science puts these definitions to use is by labeling everything in and out of sight, then waiting for a study to show a way these labeled components function or interact with other components. What this requires is a belief in the singularity of whatever has been labeled… but science is still just a model. We visualize the unseeable parts of life, imagine that we are somehow watching quarks with our eyes, just as we might imagine that we are in the Garden of Eden watching Adam and Eve. 51 And when I woke up on Sunday morning, Gregor was already over and we were going to have to leave within ten minutes. He was the one driving, again. Kerrin had mentioned to me, in the past, how tense I became with her around the city—she didn’t like the feeling she got from it. Kerrin needed coffee, but hadn’t brought her lactose pills. So, once we were in New Hampshire, we located a Wal-Mart, got her some, then got her coffee from Wendy’s. 52 We were late to the Ostara ritual, but we at least found the site with relative ease. We could hear from the parking lot that it had already started. I sat on a bench nearby. The others stood by themselves, just outside the circle. It felt odd to be present but to be stuck on the outside of the whole thing, but… it was what it was. It was my first time at a ritual with Druids. Kerrin and Gregor were talking about energy lines and having conversations with rocks. We walked off the trail talked to some alpacas. Then we went back to Kerrin’s. I started to gather my things. I tried to find the occasion to say, “Hey, I think I’m going to go now,” but Kerrin said, “Here, you’re just hanging around, take this razor and scrape that stuff stuck to the kitchen floor. ” I started to scrape, but I didn’t want to ruin the tile. “I’m going to take off,” I said. “Okay,” Kerrin replied, “So. What do you need from me before you go?” “Nothing I can think of, I guess,” I replied. These days together were supposed to have been a chance for Kerrin and I to discover more thoroughly how we got along, but without a moment of pause from always needing to do something else we had rarely had the chance to talk, either seriously or frivolously, and when we had we hadn’t been alone. Even a fraction of the affection she had been displaying online would have made me feel a lot more satisfied, but oh, well. The ride back home was satisfying. I was no longer tagging along with people in a way that seemed stifling. I smoked my cigarettes freely, stopped and stretched my legs when I felt like it, and listened to my recent demos, writing down possible changes to their lyrics while I drove. 53 When I got back home I found Alix online and so went over to see her. We cuddled on the couch, I told her about how my trip had gone. She talked about a weird night out at a bar that she had had. I tried to address questions with her while we sat at the top of her stairway, smoking cigarettes. “You’ll know if I have a problem with where anything is going,” she said, “Because with you I don’t stay quiet. I just break down and cry. ” I slept over, woke up early, did homework, went to class, was still very tired, lay down on my bed for a nap, and when I woke up it was like 7 PM. 54 I didn’t hear from Kerrin for a while. Finally we chatted online. She said I had made her friends nervous at the party we had gone to. Between that and how disappointed I had been with the visit and how distant she thought I had seemed… and also how put off I had been when she had suggested to me that I might be autistic… we agreed that dating each other wouldn’t work out.

    "body": "55 Off I go for the first shift at my new convenience store job at Cumberland Farms in Northampton. They call me on Easter morning and say, “It’d be great if you could come in at 3. ” Yup. In other news, we had a party last night. It was pretty much impromptu—I was only told around 6 PM—and considering this, it was a success. Except for what the kitchen floor looks like now. 56 Apr. 22, 2004. It is my twenty-third birthday! To celebrate, I am going to the diner and reading comic books. 57 The new kid at work gave me Edith Piaf CDs after I had shared my astonishing tales of rock concerts in the 1990’s. Two weeks into this job and I’m already acting like the humdrum yup-it-goes-like-this, got-things-into-a-routine seasoned employee, when they toss me a new hire and say, “Show him what you do”. Left work and had a drink, watching a rap battle onstage in a college town bar, and now I try to wind down, to get some sleep in my bed (alone, sadly). I have to spend this weekend in the wilderness, because I can only graduate this semester if I go on a vision quest. But within weeks I’ll have accomplished all that I need for my two-year degree, and my mother’s side of the family will either say, “Congratulations, none within our ranks have ever before achieved such education, and we are no longer ashamed of you” or they will ask, “Are you making some real money yet?” or they will say, “You are lazy and arrogant like your father, and if you ever imply that our lack of education makes us lesser, you will get punched through a wall, too. ” 58 I interviewed the woman who taught me in Kindergarten—now eighty-seven years old—for a Women in American History presentation and essay. Mrs. Slattery remains clear-headed, has taken up watercolor painting (giving me a greeting card with her work on it), intrigued me with tales from the Great Depression, and called me handsome. I gave the presentation and that’s one class final down, four more to go (over the next two weeks). 59 I wonder: how many of my customers this weekend will be same-sex couples getting married, now that our state is the first in the U. S. to allow such a thing? 60 My first act as a community college graduate was to sleep. I’m thinking it was wise of me to allocate a three-day weekend from work, including my last day of class and the two days following. I needed that. I walked around town for a good long while. I grabbed a slice of pizza and ate it, listening to headphones, inside at the windows, watching the human scenery. I noted the lack of convenient places to sit on the sidewalk. I noted all the people I wasn’t running into. A pedestrian ducked down and looked at the newspaper machine to read the headlines—photos of newlywed locals, among the first same-sex couples who had been legally wed in the united states. (I had been witness to some of that myself; I had stood near a line of folks first thing in the morning, folks who were waiting to apply for their marriage licenses. It had been the least fantastic really fantastic thing I had ever seen—a bunch of families doing overdue paperwork. That had been the striking thing about it. Most of those marriages already existed in the most important ways. Children will live out the stories they need to whether or not father can bear to read them. ) 61 Last night, she prepared drinks. “What is this?” I asked, taking a sip, and wincing. “It’s called, ‘Alix has lost her mind and doesn’t particularly care’,” she responded. “It tastes like it,” I said, taking another sip. We then proceeded to talk about how we couldn’t see each other anymore, except that we were talking in hypotheticals, except that it wasn’t just hypothetical. And I said, “Well, if you were going to tell me right now that we shouldn’t see each other anymore, I would ask for it not to end like this. I would want to stay one last night…” After we’d gone to her bed, before long, she was saying, “I’d really love to make love to you right now, but I have my period and I just don’t feel comfortable with that tonight. ” And I said something like, whatever, I thought that what we’d just done had been making love. But then again, I knew that she was referencing the conversation where we had talked about how our love and our sex just never came together. And she knew that I was thinking about it. And in the morning she put Elliott Smith in the CD player. I said, “So what’s up?” and she said, “Do you want to collect your stuff that’s here? You have a jacket, a shirt, some CDs. ” So she gathered my things and gave them to me. We hugged. Listening to some too fucking appropriate song. When the lyrics were pertinent, I broke eye contact, but she just laughed. She handed me several handwritten pages. From a notebook. “Here are some things I wrote about you. A lot of it’s addressed directly to you. ” I walked out the door. I shook my head and said, “Elliott Smith, huh?” 62 I’m cutting pizza with a spork again. That must mean I’m at work at Cumberland Farms. I’m slacking off between customers. That’s my way of providing the most pleasurable experience, once people are in the store. I’m much nicer when I’ve been able to relax. My year in Northampton is almost over. Then I move on to my next mysterious future. 63 My day felt like an insignificant dream. I’m barely communicative. Babbling nonsense. Cuddled up next to Alix on the futon. The phone rings. “Are you going to get that?” I ask. “No,” she says. The phone stops ringing, but then soon after it rings again, only once. “Is that some sort of code, the single ring?” I ask. “Not that I know of,” she replies, “But someone really wants to reach me. ” (Where did I hear that, then? Ringing once, and then hanging up, so that you know who’s calling. Wasn’t that a code that you and Henry had?) She hits *69. It was him, of course. She doesn’t call him back, but I have it in my head that he’s going to come over now. She thinks that I think that she’s trying to get me to leave… but I’m only making motions toward leaving because I know I am not in the mood to interact with Henry. But then, her arms are so welcome. Her reassurance is so welcome. We forget ourselves in that, cuddling on the futon. Then, not even cuddling, just talking. Lying next to each other, with our heads propped up. There’s a knock at the door. She whispers, “That’s Henry. ” I whisper back, “Are you going to answer it?” She hesitates, then shakes her head. “He must know that I’m here by the car,” I say. “I can go in the other room. ” She shakes her head again. We move to her bedroom. I watch her peek around the curtain to look outside. Then, her head dips slightly and her mouth half-smiles. She waves to him. He was watching, waiting for her to peek out. (Now she “has to” go. ) She disappears, then comes back and says, “That was weird. ” 64 “I’m proud of myself.  I was honest. I told him, ‘I didn’t want to answer the door, because I was hanging out with Levi and didn’t want you to flip out when you saw him. ’” “What did he say to that?” “He said, ‘Oh’. ” 65 I have something to say to her, so I tell her: “If you wanted to talk to him, you could have told me to leave and I wouldn’t have been offended. ” She must see that I mean it, because she looks genuinely surprised, and says, “Really? (Pause) I thought that you would be. ” She flatters me for it. She says, “Levi, you’re a good person,” and hugs me. I say, “But this isn’t about being a good person. ” 66 She keeps saying, “I love you” and seeming to mean it, and I keep replying, “I love you”, and meaning it. And “I love you” and meaning it, and “I love you” and meaning it, “I love you”, “I love you”, and. meaning. it. My fear is that it feels like these “I love you”s really mean, “I love you… no matter what’s going to happen next. ” 67 “We’re in a dream,” Alix says. Midnight in Northampton. I’ve already been speculating this. Something about the night is… off. “This entire town is a dream,” I say, building on her assertion, “You come for a dream, and a dream is what you get. ” She agrees, but it’s not like a dream, it’s just like a… dream. Then we’re walking through the center of town. Two kids, somewhere between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, have claimed the space at a storefront. They look to be in the middle of a serious conversation but say nothing as we pass. We cut through the lawn of a church. “It’s strange to know a place so well,” I say. “I have a memory for that fountain. A memory for that bench. For that area of grass. The Calvin. Bar 19. Hotel Northampton. Those parking spaces. Those steps. That parking lot. That pay phone. ” After she has bought a coffee at the 7-11, she asks me where I’d like to walk. I ask for her to decide. We walk towards Smith College. Young male voices grow progressively louder. “You walk too slowly,” I tell Alix. They’re saying something like “Hey, ladies!” and I fear that they’re talking to us. It’s dark, my features are obscured, and my hair is long. We follow the sidewalk into the campus. “I’m used to dealing with obnoxious people,” she says. I nod: “That’s true. You’d protect me. ” At the fountain, I know that I want to sit. She’s more familiar with this campus than I am. My one memory of the fountain involves Charlie… while he and Harvey were a couple and got by scrounging, spanging, and scheming. Charlie led me here, told me to keep watch, stripped to his briefs and swam in the fountain to collect the money it held. Alix sits next to me on the bench and continues: “I used to come here to read, write, meditate…” I’m thinking so much that I can’t process her ruminations until she says, “It’s the beginning of a new chapter, but I don’t know what the book is about. ” How many gorgeous sentiments have I missed in the months I’ve known her? “What are you thinking about?” she asks. “My life,” I reply, “And writing. And now. ” “Are you thinking about writing now?” “No. I’m thinking about writing, and about now. ” At the lake, I hear the croaking of frogs for the first time that I can remember. She says that where we’re sitting she once sat from midnight until dawn in personal reflection. It’s started to rain. This will be my second night living in the 10 x 15 ft. , newly insulated, second floor porch of my mom’s house. The year I spent in my Northampton apartment went by so, so quickly. I don’t know where I’ll be living in the fall… but I know that I want to travel a bit first. I know I want to buy a bus ticket. "

    "body": "1 July 3, 2004. VISIT [golden arches] INSIDE, the arrivals have seen at the bus terminal in Springfield, Massachusetts. My tummy feels funny still, from last night. I had no hesitation when I was preparing for this trip. I got my shit together, one piece at a time, so that I could let go when it was time to let go. The Cherry Street House had a party, marking the occasion of a change in roster at the place: Bryan’s out, I’m out, Rick and Katie are left, and Katie’s friend Katherine is moving in. I saw Charlie at the party. I told him that I was leaving for another of my cross-country adventures. “Are you going to California?” he asked. “I’m going to try,” I replied. “Are you going to see V. ?” “No, not this time around. ” But I’m happy that he asked. He was on the floor at the time, slapping down cards in a game of asshole. He was more warm to me than he has been since before that year he spent refusing to leave his mom’s house and never answering phone calls. 2 Hartford, Connecticut. Passengers who are continuing until New York City (like myself) should remain seated. Once I get some time off the bus I’ll call Charlotte and Bluejay. That Alix was at the party last night was the result of a surprising twist of fate. Her plans to head out to Boston fell through, and she arrived at the party with some six others. They had already been drinking and whatever, having started prettying themselves up at around 4 PM. She and I were both drunk and standing outside on the front porch when suddenly everyone was gone. People were going to Alix’s house—no worries, the door would be unlocked—and then it was just Alix and I, leaning on each other and beginning more and more to talk. Talk. Talk. It was about missing each other. It was about the things we said and didn’t say. And we were throwing around ridiculous words at whatever hour it must have been. There was no one to try to slap any sense into us, no one to insist that we shouldn’t float so freely inside and among ourselves. It was sad, too. It has been a surprising length of wait here on the bus in Hartford, considering that we weren’t given permission to grab a smoke while here. Ah, but now we’re rolling again. More tall buildings and highway signs. Never mind the expanse of America; even a small city is too much for me to wrap my mind around. Humans, in our vanity, erect concrete. Why this design? Who supported, funded the project, talked to the right people, because something just felt right about making it happen? Who was injured in its construction? Who came and saw the finished building and was ‘wow’ed by it? Who wrote a poem about it? 3 Southern Connecticut. I-95. Alix said that she wrote about me. Something like, “The more I get to understanding about you, the less I understand why you look at the ground as you walk. ” I think it was at my suggestion that she and I walked to her place from the Cherry Street House. Even so, I’m pretty sure she yanked me out the door, quickly, to start the walk, once we’d decided to do it. Even after all she had had to drink, she had a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon under her sweater and opened it as we walked through Northampton. She said something about how, c’mon, a person has to break the rules sometimes. Then we were gushing to each other. 4 Happy Independence Day. I’m in Philadelphia now. Day One has been good fun. The only hitch I’ve noticed so far is that I forgot to get my paycheck on Friday to deposit. So, I have about $250 less in spending money than I had planned. Total expenses so far have been about $16 (the bus pass, three hundred something dollars, I paid for a month or so ago). But, times won’t be so easy from here on out: all I did today was take a bus to Philadelphia, hang out with cool people and get a couch on which to crash. I’m going to be alone for the larger part of this trip, as far as I know, walking in unfamiliar territory with only a backpack. “That’s all you have with you to travel across the country?” Bluejay remarked, “You’re such a beatnik. ” Then they pointed out that I always seem to be wearing the same thing. I told them that I have a variety of clothing items, I just tend to wear plain black with plain black. The vision quest I went on didn’t have much to it: I basically just hung out alone in the woods for a weekend, then there was a group discussion before everyone left. One guy brought his guitar and sang Neutral Milk Hotel’s “In the Aeroplane over the Sea”. Then, when I was dropped off at my car, the first place I went was a gas station so that I could buy a pack of cigarettes. What I’m doing now feels more real to me. This trip, I’ve tried to frame it as some sort of adventure or another, when explaining it to people, but there wasn’t any point to my planning it—there wasn’t a point except that I needed to board that first bus and then go. Alix said that she was drunker than she’d been for like three years. We returned to her apartment feeling, like, so in love, and that guy and Courtney were together on the futon in the living room. Meanwhile Laurie was in Alix’s bed. So then Laurie was getting mad that she was being woken up, and Alix sat with her and talked about it, and then the wait on a mattress in the living room while Courtney and the guy made out, rubbing each other. I didn’t know where Alix was; I just wanted her there. Maybe this is just how love goes with me. Everything’s great, but it doesn’t make sense. Eventually I want some sense, so I try to figure it out… but in trying to figure it out, I mess it up. So, yeah. Don’t ask me how 2003 went. I arrived in Philadelphia. The coffee was gross, ordered at the Greyhound terminal. My new cell phone, I was having trouble figuring out how to use it, so I called Charlotte from a pay phone and left a message with Bluejay. So what then? Charlotte, I knew fully well what she looked like, having seen pictures. I didn’t know how she would laugh—the loudest laugh! And she laughed freely, which was nice. And her friend was with us. He had a funny name. We went places, then… yeah, places. What did we do? Ate Chinese food. Went to a vintage clothing shop. We were quiet with each other. And to a bar, Tattooed Mom’s, upstairs where it’s punkier with graphittied walls and loud rock music. Playing the touch screen games. And a few drinks. I didn’t expect more than just a one-drink night! And it was cool. We were going to the Liberty Bell. I told Bluejay to pick me up at the Liberty Bell. But they pointed and said, “Well, the Liberty Bell used to be there. But they moved it. ” So instead we saw a small handful of war protesters, here on the eve of Independence Day. And on display were army boots, a field full of them. Each was tagged with the name of a soldier killed in this Iraq War. I photographed them, but stopped photographing when I saw the woman who lit a candle in mourning at one specific pair of boots. Then I stood, in this city I had never been to, and oh. It really is like this. People are losing children my age to this fighting everywhere, and “everywhere” isn’t just an abstract concept used for argument, “everywhere” isn’t just different states marked by the names of these fallen soldiers. “Everywhere” means you travel crammed in a bus just as far as you want, and you’ll find it. Here and in other countries, the same look of worry, or the same look of loss, the same look of having given up because of a military fiasco. Wander to a place where no one knows anyone in Iraq and oops. They, too, have war. They, too, have this disease. They, too, need it. They, too, scream for justice. They, too, humiliate. They, too, will mutilate the bodies. But be nice. Do not yell obscenities in a crowded building. Do not speculate about suffering. Legislate, regarding violence in the media. Participate. Get out and vote. Happy Independence Day. Are you doing your part? Did they teach you History at school? Do you want to know, or do you want not to know? And do you feel? Do you stop and pause? Do you have a support system? Are you in love? Progressive? Humble? Stoic? Clean? Fit? Earth-conscious? EVERYONE MUST DO THEIR PART! Are you in the revolution? Have you turned their weapons against them? Can you pick out the enemy? When do you hesitate, when don’t you? Keep your love hidden so that no one can define it. Keep. Love. Hidden. Then Charlotte and her friend said goodbye, hug! And at that moment, my cell phone rang. Bluejay and their partner were driving up to my intersection. “Is that you?” (I wave. ) “Okay, turn to your left. Go across the street now. ” I jump into the car as quickly as I can, just in time before the light turns green, and we’re off! To rent The Triplets of Belleville. But, the others were tired and fell asleep immediately. And me? I feel better than I have in years. 5 Silver Spring, Maryland. This bus is running a bit late, and I didn’t get out to the Philly bus terminal until afternoon as it was anyway, so I think I’ll be skipping out on sightseeing in DC. It was raining in Baltimore. I considered leaving a message with Alix, just to tell her that. (She would understand the Counting Crows reference. ) But I didn’t. 6 Washington, D. C. I saw the Capitol building, but couldn’t prove it to you with a picture. That was only for a moment, as the bus was nearing the terminal. I wouldn’t have known what to do with this city, anyway, unless I had had a good six hours or so with which to explore. From here it doesn’t look very inviting. What I did snap a picture of in this city was a car’s license plate: Washington, D. C. TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION, which I had not seen before and was impressed by. 7 Somewhere in Virginia, on the highway. I sneeze boogers all over my hand and need to run to the rear of the bus to use the restroom. So far, all I’ve been able to see of Virginia? Trees. Trees along the highway. Are there exits to places from the highway? I don’t think so. That’s it. Virginia must just be trees. 8 Having a cell phone makes me want to do something I rarely did during my cross-country adventures as a teenager—call my mother. But I’m in the middle of nowhere, Virginia, and alas, I’m not able to get the required reception. On a brighter note, though, the rest stop here was selling cartons of Kool brand cigarettes, on special for TWENTY-TWO DOLLARS. This needs to excite me less.  I didn’t buy a carton, though, I just bought the buy one get one free Marlboros for $4, which, ha ha, hell yes. (By the time I return to Massachusetts, smoking in bars will be illegal state-wide. ) 9 What I’ve been listening to on this trip so far (as I recall): Thursday- War All the Time Tori Amos- Scarlet’s Walk Aesop Rock- Float The Faint- Blank-Wave Arcade Wilco- Yankee Hotel Foxtrot Simon and Garfunkel- Greatest Hits 10 (Over the water, I watched the finale to Hampton, Virginia’s fourth of July fireworks. Then I was underground. ) 11 Norfolk, Virginia. During the nights I spent considering a course for my trip, this little section of the state seemed to mysteriously attract me. Loving mysterious attractions as I do, I researched on the Internet a bit, and figured that the best town for me to stop at and explore would be this place—Norfolk—which I cannot, and probably will never be able to, pronounce quite as the locals do. Observations: lots of strip malls as we approached. I was nervous at first that I would be left to wait for three hours outside of some closed down bus terminal until the bus to Knoxville arrived. Thankfully, though, the bustling and ambitious city of Norfolk locates its bus terminal in close proximity to a legitimate “downtown”. I walked around, surveyed the landscape, watched families returning from the fireworks, and because the place called Hell’s Kitchen was so fully packed I settled on a bar/rock club called The Back Stage. The handles on the doors are large mock-ups of guitars. No strangers have spoken to me yet, unless they’ve wanted money. I was friendly and asked the bartender here about this place. That doesn’t count. Though, anyway, I’m happy enough to write in a journal. I’m happy enough to be writing again. I think about how I stopped writing these letters to myself, stopped pretty much for a full year. It’s like a missing year! How improbable. See, and I’ve been writing about Alix so much because I couldn’t before. In my mind, I just couldn’t go there. I censored what I said to others, until I couldn’t even say the intense things to myself. And of course things have been intense with her. What a… different, awkward period of time this has been for me. Just as I’ve been seeing so much of her, while she’s having such a different and awkward time herself. 12 When I write, something is finally more important than the ever-present awkwardness of being in this world. I love being in this world, but it’s fucking awkward. Speaking of which, just after writing my last entry, somebody talked to me! What’s his name? Tad? Something short and blunt like that. But not Chad, so we’ll call him Tad. I dunno. He asked me if I was writing song lyrics. I got to tell him and the gal he’s at the bar with about my little epic bus adventure of complete pointlessness. Ha ha. I’m heading south. It’s a really funny thing for me to do. Too bad no one’s interested anymore. I have to remember to call Stacy tomorrow, to be sure I have a welcome there in Atlanta. Tomorrow is Tennessee, Kentucky, and… ah, Tuesday morning is North Carolina. I planned out this leg of the trip while in Philly. Going crazy in a safe yet unfamiliar house, full of joy for discovery. Joy for discovery. There is joy for discovery. The sign said open mic on Sundays, but there’s nothing here. Too bad. I would totally use someone’s guitar and rock some tunes. This place wants a major league baseball team. Norfolk, I mean. I know because there are posters in the store windows reading “WE BELIEVE” and then a URL for Norfolk-MLB dot com or something like that. It caught my attention, because after passing like 9 churches in a row, I was quick to unconsciously interpret “WE BELIEVE” as meaning, “No atheists, pagans, or strangers allowed. ” 13 The sight of this fog, between these trees, is startling. I’m still in Virginia. I actually had to backtrack over several hours’ worth of travel because of my inexplicable need to visit Norfolk. We just left Richmond, now, and we’re heading west. Tennessee will be reached. Yeah. Eventually. Ooo, yes. Look at all this fog and trees. Fog and trees. Lots of fog and trees. 14 I just stuffed myself full of a startlingly good breakfast meal from Hardee’s. Eee! 15 Roanoke, Virginia. I want to get back to sleep. Sometimes, “rest stop” can be such a misnomer, when they don’t give you the option of remaining on the bus. 16 Bristol, Tennessee. I think I’m awake now. I was just thinking about how much my mom used to want to censor what my dad watched on television or in movies. She got really quietly pissed off if he was watching a film with nudity, or Baywatch, or anything like that. During the times I spent with V. under her parents’ roof in California, I got to see how her father would be flipping through the channels on the television. He’d find something that offended him on the television, but he could just leave the program on, and watch it, audibly clicking his tongue and saying how terrible it was, what garbage. 17 There are some pieces I never want to revisit again. I never want to have to swallow again what social travesty made someone deserve to die. If there’s any such thing as adulthood, its best benefit to me can be that I don’t need to sit in passenger seats of cars, respectfully letting poisonous words be poured down my throat. As an adult, I can say, “Stop the car; I’ll walk from here. ” 18 I do it ‘cause the world owes me nothing; We owe each other the world. &lt;/I&gt; Kerrin said, “I think it’s important that you like this song,” in reference to Ani DiFranco’s “Joyful Girl”, while we drove through Cambridge, Massachusetts, after doing her laundry one night. (Oh, how did I happen?) I am experienced, and almost everything is a lie. What am I saying? I’m throwing out questions as though someone’s here to answer me. And they’re not even real questions. Tennessee. Look, there’s some cattle. And the Christ the Kind Motel. A billboard for boys’ softball. A listing of Civic Clubs. I need to run away like never before. A sign for an A&amp;W Drive-Thru, standing over a heap of rubble. (The word “CLOSED” has been posted on the sign. ) All-American Title Loans. An old-fashioned police car parked in somebody’s front yard. 19 Called Alix from my cell phone. I think I hate my cell phone. I can’t hear a damn thing through it. I’ll try using the headset next time. She says she’s okay, and her weekend was okay, she guesses. It makes me feel bad for being on this trip, and it really shouldn’t. 20 Why the fear gripping me with age? Or have I just forgotten, have the nights of trembling and what’s-that-sound mostly evaporated from that which I can recall, to make room for the inspiration? I lived in a hotel room once, for months. At the age of seventeen, briefly, then for a longer period of time at the age of eighteen. Imagine my mother as she worried for me at home. And how I never told her about the experience, what I was doing at the time. Didn’t tell her about the cops showing up and my night in the psych ward. My fear, then, was the order of the world. My fear was that I didn’t have what it would take to face it. The fear is of a loud knock at the door. The fear is of an invasion of privacy. The fear is of unresolvable violence, and I plot in advance the quick reactions I would need to have. Sometimes I get to entertaining the notion that I will always need to run away from anything that seems like home. Then, nobody will poke me on my fortieth birthday to say, “Gotcha”. I watched Alanis Morissette on Howard Stern. She seemed to leave the show peaceful. I want to float away from politics. Take lessons learned, and. I want to begin sketching the future out tentatively. At first just some shapes, very vague, very light, overlapping with each other. The final product can be a life. I’m at an Econo Lodge in Asheville, North Carolina. I’m going to bathe. Yes, I’m going to bathe. 21 There’s a lot that I don’t understand about Alix. This wasn’t a problem until we started hurting for each other. I’ve started speaking the sentences, sometimes, but could never finish them—the ones about… what if… We were just friends until the “Okay, who are we kidding?” point. As, I kept sleeping in her bed, looking forward to returning to her. And ours was the laughter of that laughless period. Because it just comes out when there’s relaxation. She “regulates my breathing”, I say, lying next to her. I like for her to regulate my breathing. But this isn’t a matter of my plans being pitted against my emotions. This is what we signed up for. If I said to her, “Hey, how about I not leave the area? And we try to make this last?” That would be cheating. That. Would be cheating. Bathing felt good. Checking my bank balance wasn’t. I called Stacy. She said to call tomorrow afternoon, once I was in or near Atlanta. Which reminds me… I’ll try to call the 800 number to figure out times of Greyhound departures. 22 “I woke up at 10:45. Check-out was at 11. So I started getting my things together, the phone rang, it was the lobby asking if I was checking out. I said yes and asked them to call me a taxi. I went back to getting everything in my backpack, there was a knock on the door, it was the cleaning lady, I said I’d be out in just a minute, the lobby called me again to say the taxi company said it would be a half hour wait, so I said to cancel that. Then I went downstairs, signed out, started running because my bus was due to leave at 11:15 and the terminal was a half mile away. Then I see a local bus, so I hurry to catch it, I’m gasping for breath, get off the bus at the terminal, and my Greyhound is there so I make it. ” “I don’t know where you got your sense of adventure from,” my mom said, “It wasn’t from me. I pitched a tent on the porch and slept out there last night. That’s my adventure. ” Now I’m in Greenville, South Carolina, feeling good. Had an hour’s layover, found the first good cup of coffee I’ve had since Philly (finding a place with milk or half-and-half instead of just powdered creamer has been hard enough) then had a three cheese pita with sprouts and I felt like a new man!

    "body": "140 I saw Maurice open up (doing performance poetry) at the Jim Carroll show in Worcester. I didn’t realize until I saw the tickets that Jim Carroll would be performing with a band as well as reading. It felt like a special thing to be seeing. Maurice is one of several people I’ve been friends with who are now doing their artist’s thing—Alice is doing her fetish photography, Jonny is playing shows with an industrial band down there in Florida. 141 No more classes. Poetry portfolio handed in. Three finals left—one ‘take home’ (two short essays for Medieval Studies), the American Drama final on Monday, the Latin final on Wednesday. I think this is what I’m doing in the Summer: Honors 191d- Dean’s Book English 202- Major British Writers from 1700 And in the Fall: English 419h- Games Thinkers Play (Honors) English 491z- Poetry of the Political Imagination English 201h- Major British Writers Pre-1700 (Honors) Latin 310- Latin Prose English 499c- Culminating Experience: Lifelong Writing That’s slightly more intense, and slightly less intriguing, a schedule than would be ideal, but I’ve spent a zillion hours considering a zillion options, and this seems like how it’s going to happen. I’m doing the Commonwealth College Honors program– partially for its academic opportunities, partially because if I continue to do well through it I might graduate magna or summa (which by no means am I assuming that I’ll manage, although I think I’ll have at least a 3. 7 this semester, so it’s not out of the question)… and partially because, much to my surprise, I can. I was academically expelled from community college four times, but the GPA they look at is based only on credits from this particular school. So it’s funny! And I love funny. Funny is good. (But, more than that, this college thing is a desperate attempt at survival by someone who has always worried that society was out to destroy him. ) 142 I felt like getting out. Went to Diva’s alone. About half the time when I do this I run into random and fun familiar faces; the other half of the time I just rub a wine glass with my finger, looking thoughtful. After that, being in the neighborhood, I knocked on Alix’s door. Turns out she was sleeping. Because I knocked lightly, she opened the door slowly, looking afraid. But Eric came home soon and was chatty and making pasta, so then I didn’t feel so bad about having woken her. 143 Unlike some students, I do have that ‘thirst for knowledge’ and whatnot… but I went to some not-so-good secondary schools, and the only person in my family with a degree is my father (who only accomplished that after my mom divorced him and he moved away). So, learning how to be a successful student has pretty much been trial and error for me. Even though I’m doing well now, I always feel like I’m getting away with something by being where I am. I look over my shoulder, ready for someone to come and drag me back to where I came from. (Parents can divorce each other, but their influences still clash inside a child. ) 144 ENGLISH 356 Creative Writing- Poetry: 3 Credits: A- ENGLISH 368 Modern American Drama: 3 Credits: A FRENCHST 345 Intro to Medieval Studies: 3 Credits: B+ LATIN 246 Intensive Intermediate Latin: 6 Credits: A Current GPA: 3. 8 145 May 26, 2005. One week since the end of finals. I’ve spent the time researching… things. More cracks for my life to fall between. Reading books as complex as possible, in as many languages as possible. And recording songs. And hanging out on MySpace. Possibly getting a new place to live next week. Fingers crossed, I guess. 146 Happy Sunday morning! Awake now. Have eaten breakfast, have cleaned myself, have driven north excited just to get a cup of coffee in the fine little city of Northampton, Massachusetts. Partying last night paid off, in that I fell asleep late afternoon, woke around 9, then prepared myself and went to the Spiral Gallery, and by the time I returned home I was ready to sleep again for another few hours then wake up at a reasonable time. I’ve been highly nocturnal since the semester’s end, so this is a relief. (The party was enjoyable, there was fire-twirling again, and the bands Incus and Flutr Effect performed. I with a few others spelled out criss-crossing words, a la Scrabble, using alphabet cookies. ) 147 Application pending for a studio apartment in Amherst! Move-in is Wednesday, but the landlord from the apartment I had in Northampton hasn’t returned calls yet to be my reference. Monday’s a holiday—bad timing—so if I’ll be signing a lease, it’ll be the day before move-in. This would be better, I suppose, than having to apartment-hunt further; but even so, I like to think that if I had the good fortune to be a landlord, I could return a phone call once in a while. 148 But there’ll be no television in the apartment. I was debating this myself, then tonight I saw something very not okay. Like, not even funny—Family Fear Factor. What could ever make this legal, I have no idea. The talking heads love to debate whether or not same-sex couples can raise children, yet a parent who’ll stick a ten-year-old in a box and drown them to their neck in cockroaches is A-OK? 149 I moved my stuff to Amherst. Had a long day of moving. Have attacked the toilet three times with various forms of bleach in an attempt to clean it, but it’s not working. The neighbor came by to say that the former tenant lived here 4 years without him (the neighbor) ever seeing him leave. And that the cleaning ladies were screaming in my apartment yesterday. 150 Dang, my feet hurt. I’m back, finally, from the Dresden Dolls DVD shoot out in Boston. It was memorable. The power went out for a couple hours while people were in line, before soundcheck or anything had been done. This was exactly the sort of situation where doing shows with a brigade of volunteer performance artists comes in handy: the sidewalk became a nice venue for the stilt-walking (with and without fire-breathing), living statues, and so on. In a moment that was equal parts funny and unfunny a pair of paramedics, who had been called for someone who had passed out inside, knelt down next to a member of the brigade who was coincidentally lying on the sidewalk in the middle of a chalk outline as part of a street performance. We in the crowd were warned before the final encore of the show that street cleaning was happening outside and that maybe we’d better skip the last song if we didn’t want to get towed. I followed this advice, scurrying out while they started their cover of Neutral Milk Hotel’s “Two-Headed Boy Part Two”. I had a ticket when I got back to my car ($25) but having had my car towed in the Boston area before, I was quite happy not to see that happen again. My bed is beautiful. I’m making this space awesome. Back to business tomorrow. Call Verizon, find out about textbooks. Financial aid, work options. 151 “Thanks for having me over,” I said. “Anytime, Levi,” replied Britta, somewhat laughingly, from the bed through the dark. What’s funny, I recognized on the way home, is that just twenty-four hours before I had been reminiscing about this type of situation, only I hadn’t remembered how these nights of cuddling end, with me unable to relax into sleep, and the same for the other person, and me having the sense that I’ve failed to make the moves that were expected of me. With me lying there, listening to the person breathe. If she nuzzled my face, I might nuzzle back… but a night of conversation, an invite to share the bed, and kiss-memories of the night we slept next to each other a year and a half ago at my apartment in Northampton are still not enough to get me to make a move. 152 Woke up to knockings on the door—someone come to clean the toilet and take away the former tenant’s trash. And the toilet was, in fact, cleaned, rather quickly, much to my surprise. Of course, the big thing for me would be the air conditioner. Now listening to Billie Holiday, eating some waffles, and planning next to shower and head out to UMass to get books for classes. 153 Feeling hot hot hot. As I was stepping out of the shower, there was another knock at the door—maintenance people again, this time come regarding the air conditioner. The filter was cleaned and the machine was turned on, but I could tell by the fact that the guy was measuring the machine’s size that he wasn’t optimistic about how well it would work. He said to try it and if it didn’t cool things down to call. Which I will be doing, because this machine hasn’t cooled things down at all. And furthermore, the off switch isn’t working, so I can’t even turn it off. I took the bus to UMass—not a bad trip at all. A five minute walk to the bus stop, buses run every half hour during summer and every fifteen minutes during the school year. Then it’s, oh, a ten minute ride to campus. I went to the Textbook Annex, where the only three people in there were me, Salma, and her roommate, each of us having arrived on our own without knowing that the others would be there (and we all discovered each other at the same time). I got my book for the Dean’s Book class—Bastard out of Carolina—and rode with Salma. She’s taking one summer class at UMass and had business to attend to at the Continuing Education office. For some reason the university has relocated said office to another town entirely, into Hadley, in the same building as the market research center of Abt Associates, where I, Salma, and every other person who has ever been desperate for employment in Hampshire County has at various times worked. Then we ate at Black Sheep and talked about this and that. She realized that she had lost track of time and needed to get going. I walked home. 154 I went to Haven. Tina, Harvey, Britta, Tingley, Laurel, Jay and his ladyfriend Deb (who was an art student lurking around the C building in my days of HCC, 2000-ish. ) Gabe, Draya, Kilean. Today, no word on the air conditioner, but it turns out the phone can get turned on tomorrow. DSL, however, may take as long as until the 20th of the month to be working. I’ll have to look into when the service month ends for my dial-up, use that maybe until DSL is working. Can’t find a place in this town to use wireless—not Rao’s, not Black Sheep, only the Thirsty Mind in South Hadley have I been able to work with… so I was there today, where it was air-conditioned! And I continued research about grad schools, the teaching profession, fleeing the country, and so on. 155 Worked some more on “Forest of the Damned”. What a bizarre song. But I enjoy recording bizarre songs, and that must be worth something. I’m cooking ravioli. Gonna read some more of Bastard out of Carolina. Wondering if I’m playing Cyndi Lauper at too high a volume, if I’m bothering the neighbors. Probably not. 156 Harvey and Tina. They live together, now. I guess they haven’t lived together before, although it seems like they should have. Harvey is nice to me at the beginning of the night, before he starts doing his asshole thing. “It’s good here…” (meaning the party) “…small, just hanging out. Your type of thing. I think one of my favorite ‘parties’ was the night where it was just me, you, Charlie, Tina, and Bill. ” Flashback! And we reminisce about 2001 again. And we talk about LiveJournal. How it’s dying out. And he even says, “You used to use LiveJournal well. ” Mourning the waning potential of the personal blog. Time passes. A skinny younger girl named Sarah keeping me in conversation in the kitchen while I refill my glass from the alcoholic punch bowl, but such a kid. She misses sex; it’s been two weeks! Thinking in further specifics about the conversations of the night would be too much effort for me right now. 157 Checklist of things to become confident about: -Choose grad programs -Plan what you will need to do if accepted… -…including financially -Plan what you will need to do if rejected -Plan finances and time management for the next 14 months Then? I become a battering ram. 158 I stay awake later each night, despite my attempts at waking myself early. Helena’s girlfriend is away, so we’ve been chatting, and she even called me during the day once. Finished recording “Forest of the Damned” this week. Have people to call. Credit reporting agency—I was denied the opening of a bank account, which I didn’t think was possible. The real estate management—I still am lacking air conditioner. Then, I’ll be looking at part-time work. I’m eyeing the Cumberland Farms across the street, actually. I love being able to walk to work. For some reason, the scattered moments over the course of Saturday night’s party in which Harvey was an ass to me, or even just the moments when I didn’t like him—those, of all things that could be bugging me, have been kicking around inside my head. Like when I said something flippant and negative about our nation’s currently having a Republican President, and he stuck his head in the room from the kitchen: “Hey! Shut up! Who said that?” and no one said anything. I, at least, couldn’t guess at first what anyone had said wrong, but I just said, anyway, “It was me. I said it. What did I say?” and I think my mind’s just dwelling on how he’s getting worse as he gets older. Actually, I think it’s that I never much liked him, but we had care for Charlie in common and saw each other plenty and I never had reason to stress about this guy. But now that I’m getting more intentional and selective about my life, I’m noticing what I don’t like about people I’ve known for awhile. That way, leaving them behind is easier. I was only searching for family, I think sometimes. Through all those friends and lovers. I wanted to be obligatory and knowable, like a constellation. (Huh, weird metaphor. ) Why do some of us in this age feel the need to redefine our character so often? A necessary evil. Yes, I value individuality, because sameness causes too much pain—pain that can’t be described, ever, pain of not being able to describe, ever. That’s powerlessness, right there… and although I don’t really value power in itself, I guess I do value the lack of powerlessness. I’m not sure any of this makes sense. I should sleep. 159 Pretty much zero luck so far with my aspirations for today. I’m told the air conditioner came in today, “But there’s an issue with the size of it, so there’s another piece we won’t have until Wednesday. ” And I missed the window of opportunity to call about my credit report, because the hours they man the phones are only 9 AM to noon. Heh. And regarding that Capstone Course I’m looking to take next year—the Professor hasn’t responded to my email—I was told that the best thing to do is just to wait. Wow, I’m hot. I just did the dishes and, since it’s hotter in the kitchen where there’s no fan, it was all I could do not to wipe the sweat from my face with the dish towel. I hate the heat. And it’s not just me anymore: everyone I speak to is pretty much in agreement, this persistent weather is shitty. At least there have been intermittent rainshowers. I want to go somewhere air conditioned; unfortunately, I feel notably unwelcome when I go to my mom’s place now, as though they think I’m going to start living there again. Alix isn’t returning my calls. We were talking about hanging out today! I finished Bastard out of Carolina last night, have a paper to write about it for Thursday. And I’ve been story-writing; that’s important. "

I was asleep for like an hour and a half, then I woke up from a dream in which I was the comic actor Chris Elliot, filming a scene for a movie. The plot was that a redneck offered for me to star in a porn movie with his wife. In the scene, a can of whipped cream was emptied on my face and I fell asleep while it happened, then woke up breathing whipped cream. I guess it was sort of a nightmare. 162 “No,” Alix said, “You can’t move far away. ” And when Eric came home, she and I retraced our most recent conversation for him: “We were talking about how the parakeet could be released into the wild and be happy here, because the weather’s been like it is in a rainforest. And then if there were another parakeet, they could mate and start a whole population of parakeets around here. But then they’d all get eaten by the hawks because they’re, like, day-glo. Then she was reminded how pretty hawks are, so she wants to get a pet hawk. ” “Not in the apartment,” he said. Then they cuddled, and we all played Scrabble. 163 Waiting for Bruce to come. I’m at home. A spark plug came out from my car again, causing loud sputter-sputter. First time was yesterday, as I came from dropping off a work application to the Thirsty Mind. I thought it was because I was out of gas, which I almost was. It’s time for me to give it over to him and Mom and let them do with it as they want. Friday I picked up Amelia from work and we came to my apartment. She worked on vocal ideas for a song and I gave commentary. Alix called to remind that she was having people over, so we went. Eric was there, Roo, Kelsey, the Dave who is Alix and Eric’s friend, a younger girl who had been at Harvey’s party, plus a friend of hers. I talked with Alix for awhile, drank some blackberry brandy mixed with Coke, then we took turns playing songs for the audience that remained in her bedroom. Amelia and I went back to my apartment, slept with space between us on my bed, and in the morning I dropped her off. 164 I just looked over and there was a kitty staring from the other side of my apartment’s screen door! Meowing pathetically at me. Asking if I could spare some food. I gave some yellow American pasteurized processed cheese food. I’m not sure how good that is for a kitty, but the kitty seemed to enjoy it and now looks satisfied and ready to start the day. 165 July 2, 2005. I received a text message from Heather, my online friend in Vancouver, around 1 AM, wishing me a happy Canada Day. In return, I also wished her a happy Canada Day, but it wasn’t Canada Day in her time one yet. It was Canada Day in my time zone, but I wasn’t in Canada; I was in Massachusetts, and just waking up for the day. It’s hard to say exactly what I spent the night doing. Nights are just like that, when I’m alone. I believe I was chatting until something like 4 AM, simultaneously researching grad programs. In the morning I knew I wanted to get out of the house. Doing so was likely to keep me awake until later, and I wanted to start sleeping at night, rather than during the day. First I wanted to get myself in a positive mood, so I groomed myself properly, cleaned up the apartment, and overwhelmed the space with burning sage that eventually I drenched with water and threw out for fear of triggering the smoke detector. I drove to Northampton, carried my laptop to Javanet, thinking that I would do some writing… First, though, coffee and a cigarette outside. There’s Lucas, on his way to work. It’s a nice day. He stops to chat. We talk about what it’s like to live in Amherst. (He used to live there. ) Tina comes by and gives me a squeeze; it’s her first day living in Northampton again. (She and Harvey had been evicted, I believe, for one reason or another, from their place in Easthampton. She said that moving her things out had been an annoying process, that the spray paint fumes had been overwhelming… yes, Harvey had learned that they wouldn’t be getting any security deposit back. ) Then to Herrell’s to get Tina’s paycheck. We sit and she eats butter pecan, which I taste. Gamer Adam comes by, there’s chit-chat. I go to my car just as a meter maid is ticketing it. I move my car. I see someone from Latin class and say hi. We meet up with Merlin, go back to Tina’s new place. (Tina’s now living at what used to be universally known as Kevin-and-Polly’s, although Kevin and Polly split up recently. ) Tina’s hoping to hear from one of her not-boyfriends, who has her stuff still in his van. The futon is pulled out. It’s hot in the apartment. Tina’s on the couch. Merlin and I are both lazily lounging on the futon and it’s the two of them talking, mostly. There’s plenty to look at in Kevin’s apartment. It’s the afternoon on a summer day. There’s something unique about relaxing on such a day, and at such a time… it’s a real sense of leisure, and an experience that I’ve had around Tina in the past. Their built-in bar in his living room, used at parties. A large space in a great location, this apartment, getting passed from group of people to group of people. We go to JavaNet to check email and in case Tina can get to talk to that guy who works there now. I figure I know about whom she’s speaking, and I’m right. I talked with him one night fairly recently, along with Britta and Angus. His name’s Nick. Dark glasses while inside, tattoos, English major at UMass. Not working that day, but is stopping in. Stays and talks about pornography. “So where did you come from?” I ask, and he laughs too loudly and says, “Mars”, which I know is all I’m gonna get from him (although an older man comes in and asks, “Where’ve you been? Off at some expensive estate, visiting your parents?” and he says, “Well, I did drive my father’s Mustang recently, but it wasn’t exciting… he only drives automatics”). Tina and I go back to the apartment and just sit around, I think. I’m overtired by this point, and everything gets more dreamlike. I ask Tina’s opinion—how crazy am I? And she says I’m not very crazy at all. I say that being socially alone—even though I know it has much to do with my life choices—it makes me wonder if there’s something terribly wrong with me, that I just can’t see. “There’s nothing that I can see,” she says. Her not-a-boyfriend, I can’t remember his name, he comes by and the moving begins. I’ve been watching people walking along Pleasant Street, loving everyone, today. Then I’m carrying crates full of picture frames, books, random photographs from high school, notebooks of poetry. Up to the fourth floor, and the weather’s a bit hot so I’m sweating, keep stopping, drinking water then refilling the common-use Brita filter. Up the stairs, down the stairs. When I’m overexerting myself and rushing, Tina (walking halfway up the stairs) will start a conversation about nothing, and listening to her talk, I sit on the steps, resting. “I wonder if it’s going to rain,” she says, looking out the window. “Oh, thank you,” I say, “Rain is a great idea!” And when it starts to rain, I’m on the street sitting with her not-a-boyfriend, and I tell him, “Tina made it rain!” and he says, “Oh, did she cast a spell?” and I say, “No, she just mentioned the idea of it raining. That’s all it takes for Tina. ” “I’d believe that,” he says. And I say, “I’ll believe anything for a moment, if it makes me feel better about the situation,” smoking an American Spirit cigarette in the late afternoon. When night came around, Tina and I went to the World War II Club (after she made me macaroni and cheese). She bought me a drink. Some white guys with a video camera mutilated Run DMC’s “It’s Tricky”. Jay Barnes was there with the Deb he’s dating. I was almost falling asleep as I walked from person to person, listening to others talk. I wished that I had it in me to be more of a charmer, with great things to say while hanging out at a bar, but I still needed to drive home to Amherst, because I could. It’s my responsibility to do what I’m capable of doing. I would sleep that night, and I would wake up in the morning. It wasn’t Canada Day anymore in my time zone, but it still was in Vancouver. And how many Americans know about that holiday, anyway? 166 I went with Alix, Eric, and their friend Dave to Dark Millennium at the Webster Underground in Hartford—basically a replacement for the now-non-existent night, Bound, which used to be held there. Kilean was DJing. There weren’t many people out. It was said that the cause was the Independence Day weekend. Alix drank too much rum, which is never good for her. We sat on a couch and talked about our friendship and how it’s a great thing and how we should be like this. And she talked about her current thoughts of love and friendship and stuff. She told Eric to tell Kilean to play “Hallo Spaceboy” by David Bowie, but he didn’t have that CD, so I suggested “Dead Man Walking” as a substitute Bowie song. And then dancing, dancing… and what Alix called “the drunkest she’s ever been”, although I’m pretty sure I’ve heard her say that before. She didn’t throw up until she got back home, at least. Tuesday I went to Haven. I was in a good mood, looked pretty, but spent a lot of the night sitting alone. I hung with Tina for a while, which was good, and Harvey, which was fine. Fuller was watching the dance floor… “Look at that guy,” he said, “Dancing at a higher BPM than the song actually calls for. ” He then speculated on this dancer’s brainwave patterns. When I asked him why I wanted to make out with somebody, he said that wine is an aphrodisiac. Then I met Jesse and Shepherd. Shepherd and I ended up talking for awhile, good talk about the Humanities, and Hampshire County, and how people who found Augusten Burroughs’ Running with Scissors unbelievable just didn’t know Northampton/Amherst. I spoke about the ways of dating “around here”, said I’d pretty much given up and that it wasn’t a big deal, having only my senior year remaining to tie me here. My discussing such matters with an unknown woman was a kind of bold, unusual, good thing, but felt safe because we were having a good talk and she’s been with Jesse for a couple years and didn’t seem to worry about the possibility that I might be flirting. I thought it nice that, though I’d at least noticed Jesse around before, these were new people to me, mostly. She told me, “My boyfriend’s been mistaken for you a few times,” which was funny. Okay, I’m off to Alix’s now. 167 On a whim I brought a CD of the two songs I’ve recorded this year with me to Alix’s house. I found myself slightly embarrassed, listening to their nice-try-but-not-quite production quality while other people were around. Even so, Dave seemed to like it. He looked up from his laptop (which was accessing the Internet via the downstairs neighbor’s wireless) to ask: “Who is this?” “It’s me,” I said. “It’s you?” He make an expression of surprise that I didn’t believe at first. I guess I do tend not to alert acquaintances to the fact that I make music as a hobby. Alix played for me some more of her recent recordings, then, which I thought were excellent. She has been suggesting for awhile that I should work with her, do some backup vocals for her song recordings. As always I say sure, but this time we elaborate a bit more on our potential for working musically with each other. Her equipment allows better final mixes of her work than I know how to do with my own. I have a better microphone than she has. We make plans to get together to work on each other’s songs. Flash forward to the next night. We’re trying to work on one of her favorite songs of mine, “I Melt”. It’s going okay, but I’m getting sleepy sooner than expected… “Can I lie on the living room floor and watch TV for a bit?” I whine. She allows me to do so for a bit, while Jay Leno interviews actress Jessica Alba. Flash forward again, to tonight. I said that we should work on the song she was playing on keyboard when I walked into her apartment. First I became inexplicably sad, staring into space and starting to write on guitar a song I’ll never finish. Then I lay on her living room bedspace again (minus the Leno and Alba) and again she yelled at me: “Stop going crazy!” she commanded, shaking/hugging me. “Oh, yeah,” I said, still retaining some warmth and humor, “That fuckin’ works. Too bad I never thought of that any of the times I was with you and you were freaking out. ” Somehow, she got me to go to the car and drive us to the supermarket, where she bought a salad and cigarettes. Then, we sat in front of Javanet and talked about whatever, went to Deals and Steals to look for a hat for her. Then we went back to her place and got to the musical task at hand. By the end of the night, we had a mostly-finished recording of “Beg for Your Time”. 168 I was excited about the song we recorded. By the next day she had tweaked it some more, and we re-recorded my vocals. She demonstrated another partially-written song, still untitled. We worked on tweaking it to make it work for us as a duo. Then she was feeling the need to leave the house. We were planning to go to a party at Kelsey’s (and her Mom’s) house that evening, but we didn’t have any wine, so we went to my apartment to scrounge together change for a bottle. Back to Alix’s, then, Leigh showed up with her new beau. Then Dave showed up. There was conversation. By then, Alix and I had come up with a band name—Wilting Lily. The name came by way of a long discussion of ideas during which I said, “I think it should have something to do with death and flowers. ” She suggested the name first; then I suggested it, too, because I hadn’t been paying attention when she had suggested it. 169 The girl who says she hasn’t seen me in three years—I wonder how much I liked her. And ah yes, there’s Jonny, in town for a few days while on tour in an industrial band. And the other of the only two male friends I’ve had since high school, Maurice. He and I haven’t hung out except once in the past couple years, but he says, “I want to have a CD of my spoken word I can sell at shows. Can you record me tomorrow?” And I’m like, “Yeah, sure”. and he’s like, “What have you been up to?” and I’m like, “I’m a good student, and I’m here trying to socialize for a little bit while I have the time, because mostly I’ve disappeared cocooning and writing fiction and looking at grad schools” and he’s like, “Yeah, I’ve been finding fewer gigs trying to make a living with performance poetry. I’m looking to move to San Francisco and work on my craft in art school” and I’m like, “Cool,” and he’s like, “Yeah” and all around us are familiar faces like Whitehouse, who carries a plush lizard over his shoulder, and I’m like, “What’s up?” and he’s like, “I’m trying to get a job selling cars, for some real income, because I’m certainly not making money by owning a gaming store” and I’m like, “Cool,” and he’s like, “It seems as though all these people who were directionless a couple years ago are getting their shit together” and the strong scent of clove burning with tobacco on the smoking porch merges with a clear summer sky in a nowhere fantasy land of aspiration and tolerance then a woman I don’t actually know but have seen around and maybe spoken to once or twice trying to tell me because she overhears me talking to some guy and I don’t even remember who the guy was but in response to some inquiry I’m saying that I’m single and it’s not worth changing my trajectory to find someone right for me in the here and now she tells me I have to be aggressive! but simultaneously that actual love doesn’t know boundaries and doesn’t care where you are in life but apparently love requires me to be aggressive! I look at this one guy and I turn to this other guy (older than I) and say, “That boy always reminds me of myself a few years ago” the way he’s so cutely disoriented among women who are petting his head and reaching in curiously for kisses. (Maurice, in contrast, used to tell me that his pretentiousness was practical, to keep away the swooners. ) 170 It’s cute, we’re at Denny’s, Maurice has anecdotes how it’s the craziest people who arrange poetry readings, then he and Jonny they both have to pee at the same time and it’s just me and two of Jonny’s now-bandmates at the table and I’m like, “How did you get to working with Jonny?” and they’re like, “His teacher was so and so who used to work with us for so and so and anyway he kept coming to our shows and we just wanted him as an engineer but he kept wanting to, you know, be on stage, be like one of the guys, heh, and you know, we were opening up for one of his favorite bands…” (Jonny is walking back but his bandmate doesn’t stop talking) “…and he was like, ‘If you want me to play guitar with you’ and we were like, ‘Uhh, okay thanks, fuck you, here’s some comp tickets. ’” Jonny says: “Who is this you’re talking about?” and bandmate says some name I don’t know, then later offers Maurice a place to crash if he ever has shows in their area and it’s nighttime and my online friend Barry has been calling from North Carolina, reminding me what it’s like to talk about music, comic books, video games, things with which my familiarity is mostly residual, emblematic of times past, and Thursday night I gave a short class presentation, the last day of the first session of the Summer classes I’m taking. My topic was the coming of age novel, its history. Class settings like this make me wonder at the lives of students who stock poster-board for such occasions, using glue stick and photos, illustrating their confident and charismatic undergraduate presentations; in their preparation, I imagine, they are rarely staring as I do at notes trying to make perfect segues and trying to think logically without generalizing. Instead, they have fully-developed personalities already and it’s amazing, students outside of the Humanities especially, how it never seems to occur to so many of them—and I don’t say this insultingly—that characters in novels are not actually real. They’re always, “What advice I would give to this character is…” whereas with me, I don’t even know what advice to give to people in real life. I only suggest metaphors for the themes my friends develop, like. And I hug them and hope they don’t notice that I have no idea what they should do with themselves to make things better. The silly part was having to say the word, “bildungsroman” a bunch of times. And it was hot and I forgot to bring water, and recording Maurice went well, and Dean’s Book class finished—I got an A—and I’ve started in Major British Writers 1700-1900, which looks to be easy enough, enjoyable enough, nothing strenuous. Leaving me time, still, to obsess over my fiction and to work toward getting accepted into Creative Writing programs. I’m signed up for GRE testing early in September. I’ve been surprised in my preparations, finding that my first attempt at a practice exam got me a very good verbal score of 610. Some writing programs don’t even require GREs, but some do, and who knows—if a Ph. D. might be in my future, a decent score might be worth something. Plus, percentage rankings stroke a young intellect’s ego like nothing else can. And I expanded upon “Nancy &amp; Jester”, my story, which originally sat for a month or so as a page and a half that I didn’t know what to do with. I think it’s finished now, at eight pages. I toiled over that one. Although, I’ve been toiling over all my stories. I submitted it to McSweeney’s, just in case, and right now, it’s what I feel is my strongest piece, and Tina is single again, which to hear her describe it is a terrible and excruciating pain. I felt like the bottom of the barrel she was scraping when she said, “So Levi, when are we going to cuddle again?” so casually, although the notion had never come up in the past four years… but hanging out with Tina is fun. After Haven we walked Noho and danced to the music left playing in the entrance way to the Northampton Box Office. Then she made macaroni and cheese with bits of onion and breadcrumbs and we lay on the roof trying to spot constellations, talking about New York City. She showed me pictures in her room, and it was about 5 AM, and she lay next to me on her bed in her undergarments as we read aloud, together, from a Jon Stewart book, a mock interview of Adolf Hitler by Larry King. I cuddled with her comfortably for a minute, but she was falling asleep. She brought this up around company when next I saw her and apologized because, after all, it had been around sunrise, and she had gotten really tired, and Tina and I are supposed to go to New York the weekend of the 30th. My reason for proposing that we go together was that Helena has been telling me to visit for months… but an email and a LiveJournal comment have both failed to elicit response from her. And Eric keeps “breaking up with” Alix, which isn’t cool, and this sends her into panic every time. “He’d be so great if he’d just stop breaking up with you,” I said to her. Though also, their finances haven’t been in perfect shape. Currently they’re at Alix’s mother’s house, and I wouldn’t have thought that I could feel so exhausted after a British Literature class… but in lieu of a normal discussion, today we had a debate of “Parliament” circa 1791 (having no real similarity to Parliamentary proceedings) in which speakers in the House of Commons were to argue in support of a vague, what you might call progressive agenda vs. speakers in the House of Lords (three other people), whose job it was basically to be conservative. Then the class (undecided members of the Parliament) decided whose orations swayed them more. The debate lasted for three quarters of an hour. And we won, somehow, but that was way too stressful. I hope we can just have a regular old discussion next time. I wanted to go up to the instructor and beg, “We only had nothing to say last class because we were reading Wordsworth! Next time, we’ll have things to say again! I promise! No more creative teaching, please!” Sleep, rise, sleep, rise, go to Northampton, a day of sidewalk sales, old woman in a wheelchair talking about travels around the world, how she was admitted into a certain tribe and lived with them, her one condition being that she not be circumcised. Then Jonny sat next to me, fresh from having quit whatever the hell that band was called. Brought me along for drink and to tell the tale of drama that split apart the band. He’ll be going back to Florida in a couple weeks, he’s still got a good thing going down there, and a ladyfriend. I make my gums bleed twice in one day—once by picking between my teeth with my fingernail and in the process accidentally using too much momentum and slicing my gums a little, and the second time by accidentally jamming the inside of my upper lip with a toothbrush while brushing. I rule. I also spent a stupid amount of time on Brit Lit homework—midterm plus reading plus response paper—and poked idly at the Internet when taking breaks from that. That all doesn’t sound very exciting, maybe, but then the other day was different: I was feeding geese, and there was this squirrel, and it kept darting between the geese and I was feeding it, too, and… and… okay, never mind. Sorry, I’m not very entertaining lately. I’ll try to find a torrid love affair or something. What does “torrid” actually mean, anyway? Checks Merriam-Webster Oh, right. “Scorching” or “Passionate”. That make sense. Drinks water Mmm. Oh, in other exciting news, I’ve started using antacids. Next thing you know, I’ll be popping aspirin. Then it’ll be painkillers. Then straight-up opium. And then I’ll die. "

    "body": "171 I’ve discovered that I like going for walks in the morning. Because I shy away from hot, humid weather, it’s a small window of opportunity. It’s good to be up early. Last night was fun. It has been a fun past several days, in general. It turns out that I like the food at the restaurant Paul and Elizabeth’s in Northampton. It’s difficult to forecast whether I’ll like a restaurant or not, since where I grew up, fine dining meant the place with the largest portions of prime rib, and there’s seemingly no rhyme or reason as to what food I’ll eat and love, or what food will frighten me so much that eating it will ruin my evening. I also learned (though thankfully not at Paul and Elizabeth’s) that I can enjoy the company of well-behaved two-day-old goats. One of the benefits to having grown up ignorant to all but a tiny range of lifestyles is that I am very easily excited by simple things, like walking through farmland on a foggy evening or eating broccoli. I was aghast at receiving a 91% on my British Literature mid-term, which made me realize that I need to chill the fuck out. I cut fun out of my life for awhile, opting instead to prove to myself that I could do certain things academically—an ambitious “I’m going back to school and getting my Associate’s Degree!” once fulfilled led to “And then I’ll transfer and get my B. A. !” led to “And I’ll do well in classes!” led to “And I’ll be an Honors student!” led to “And I’ll spend countless nights researching graduate options!” and was beginning to obscure the aspiration at the core of my endeavors, which was to live as an unrecognized creative-type person while sufficiently supporting at least a lower middle class standard of living, but not dying especially young. (What can I say? I’m a dreamer. ) Also, I was dealing psychologically with the paradigm shift of no longer putting the bulk of my energy into trying futilely to bring joy and hope to the lives of anybody who would talk to me. So, lately, I’ve been remembering how to interact casually with other human beings, and I’m hoping to keep doing that in a productive way, because there has to be a compromise between personality and resumé, and I need to have a life first if I’m going to figure out what to do with it. 172 There was Haven. It was Britta’s twenty-first birthday. I hugged her. I guess she pet me a little or something, and I pet her back and she said something like, “Don’t do that unless you’re going to date me. ” At which point, we decided to go on a date. So we did, the next night; though, it being late, we pretty much just got coffee, then sat outside on the campus of Mount Holyoke. We returned to her place. No one else was there for the moment. She showered while I read from Pale Fire. Then she came out in nightclothes and lay on me. We kissed and talked. She voiced uncertainties about getting involved with me: “Julian’s going to kill me,” she said. Then she said that she was going to sleep, and I left after telling her that I hoped we would be able to keep getting to know each other better. I knew that the next time I’d see her would be her party two nights later. 173 I went to the dumpster and noticed that several of my neighbors had left their trash outside of it rather than inside of it. I wondered why, but proceeded to open the lid. This sent a swarm of bees flying around. I dropped the lid, took a step back, noticed that none of the bees had come after me, opened the lid again and put my trash in. It’s fun to know that I’ve never been stung. Maybe it has something to do with how little skin I tend to leave exposed… but I prefer to think that dangerous insects simply like me and don’t want to hurt me. 174 I like to buy Ivory Soap, because it smells like motel. 175 What happened after Britta’s party (while Jonny slept in my bed) was that I spoke with Lyric online. She said that she had broken up with Daniel. I said, “Again?” she said, “For real this time. ” She was in Chicopee with a relative. And I met her at the 7-11 in Chicopee, to which I used to walk from my mom’s place. She seemed different, more confident. We walked Northampton, which of course was mostly empty (it being 3 AM-ish) and then we went to my apartment in Amherst, sitting in the kitchen, while I made cheese ravioli for myself. Eventually I woke up Jonny, drove him to his car in Northampton, and dropped Lyric off, too. 176 Before long I heard from Britta again. She was doing laundry at Masonic Street Laundry, and at night we were going to 80s Night at Diva’s, and on our way to the car there she was like, “So are we dating?” and I said that I’d like to have a nice long conversation to figure that out and she asked, “Could that be from here to the car?” and I was like, no. Eventually we saw each other again and, in Pulaski Park, I said that there were too many emerging concerns. 177 And I took Lyric out to eat for her twenty-third birthday. And I finished my Brit Lit class. And I want to type up these entries and get the summer of 2005 properly archived. I’m also putting my fiction portfolio together for writing MFA programs, which I think I will after all apply for, because having stopped stressing out so much about trying to write Well Enough I find that it’s something I really want to do, and it seems such an obvious choice, and anyway I’ll be taking a two-semester course called Lifelong Writing and c’mon, like, y’know? 178 “So if I hadn’t shown up, you would have gone to the movie by yourself?” I asked. “Yes,” said Britta, “And I’ve only gone to the movies by myself once or twice. I don’t like doing it. ” 179 “Hold on,” I said, “Let me say hi to my friend who’s working at the candy store. Maybe you can get your chocolate here. ” My friend at the candy store (Shepherd) was wearing a long vinyl coat. She gave us free chocolate. “Ah, yes,” I said, “The town where everything’s free. ” 180 At the entrance to the movie theater. Britta, holding the door, stopped for a moment and said, “This is where we’ve decided that we’re not going to date each other, so we stop getting nervous around each other. Isn’t it?” “I guess so,” I said, “Now we’ve actually gotten to that comfortable point we were trying to get to, but couldn’t. ” 181 We went to buy the movie tickets. “Well, hello!” said the employee—he had been the instructor of my Dean’s Book class during the Summer. “Oh!” I said, “Hello. ” “Good to see you. Keeping up the reading, I see. What have you got there? GRE study guide… uh huh… and Seneca. Well! You’re… well, you’re an Honor student. What are you going to see?” “Uh, Broken Flowers. ” “Be my guest. Please. ” “Oh! Well… thank you!” We walked inside, for a free movie to go with our free chocolates. She held my arm and said, “Heh, wow. I should have you be my date for these things more often. ” 182 The credits were rolling. “Can we leave?” she asked, “No one’s leaving. ” “Maybe they’re waiting to see if there’s something after the credits. ” She kissed me passionately for a few seconds. “Wow,” I said. She got up and walked out of the theater. 183 Hurricane Katrina devastates New Orleans. People stand confidently, saying, “See the disaster. See how it just goes to show what I’ve been saying all along. ” 184 I take the GRE. 650 verbal, 640 quantitative. 185 And it’s the start of the Fall semester. Shockingly, it seems like Latin will be pretty low-stress. But that’s good, because I’m going to be busy otherwise. I’ve started a job shelving books at the public library. Which is exactly how it sounds, except, at least today, there were free peppers in the break room. Which, I didn’t even know that people ate peppers, like, raw and by themselves. I’m not sure how that works. 186 I am, I notice, afraid to believe that I know how the world works. This is probably because the world that I was originally told I was living in would have been unbearable for me if it had been the only possibility. As a teenager, feeling desperate, my most vivid reoccurring fantasy was that I would meet someone who had run away from home, or who had been kicked out from home. I imagined saying, “Fine, then, let’s just leave this town. ” We would go somewhere else that looked entirely like the town we had left. We would get jobs washing dishes. We would share a cheap studio apartment and hold hands with each other. That was my dream. So when I did eventually find friends, I wrote volumes about the amazing experiences I had. To me it felt like the pleasures, the intensity, the surprise of it all must be unprecedented. (When in fact, even the most out there of my childhood escape fantasies fell short of what many of the friends I would later meet had taken for granted all along. ) 187 Me: “Hey, I left, like, a five subject notebook here yesterday. ” Employee: “Oh, yeah, the blue one. I’ve been holding onto it. ” Me: “Thanks. ” Employee: “Hey, is this your Palm Pilot, too?” Me: “Um, no. ” 188 I wake up and think, What happened? How did my alarm not go off until 2 PM? Oh, crap. And what a strange mistake, for my alarm to be incorrectly set for 2 PM instead of 8 AM. I don’t even have time to call work and try to explain why I missed my shift. I’ll have to email after my classes are over for the day. Quickly I change my shirt and brush my teeth and put my shoes on and gather my things and go to the car. I start driving quickly, thinking that I’ll have just enough time to stop at the copy shop, which I assume will have a course packet for the class I switched into (because neither the college bookstore nor any of the four bookstores in town have books listed for the class. ) Then I notice that the clock in my car says it’s 7:15—which, because I don’t know how to adjust my clock for daylight savings time, actually would mean 8:15. Then it’s a game of trying to figure out whether it’s 8:15 AM or 2:15 PM and meanwhile trying to figure out… if it’s actually in the 8:00 hour, how did I ever confuse an 8 for a 2 on my clock? I park and go into the copy shop, stand there looking like a man out of time (which I am) and the guy asks, “Course packet?” and I’m like, “Is it 8:15 in the morning?” and he’s like, “Yeah,” and I’m like, “Wow,” and then I figure out that they don’t have a packet for my course anyway. Then I go home and my clock is working perfectly fine, but my toaster malfunctions and burns my waffles again. 189 Woke up sweat-drenched at 4 in the morning. Broke the hot water knob in my shower trying to make it stop leaking. Yesterday, because it sucks, I dropped the English course that I had added after switching from a different English class, which also had sucked. I switched to Roman Civilization, with the same professor as my Latin Prose class, which she referred to yesterday as “Afternoons with Seneca”, which is my new name for it, because it’s just us reading Seneca three days a week. The thing about this Roman Civilization class, though, is that it walks all over my schedule of work at the library. But I just realized (and apparently, no one would have told me this if I hadn’t done the math and asked the right questions for myself) that although the plus side to getting a “work-study job” is immediate acceptance and low, low expectations of me, if I kept working as much as I’ve been working I’d just stop getting paid after about seven weeks. So I don’t know. I’ll have to talk to the person at the library and figure out if I can work a different schedule for… six hours a week or whatever. But with this course change, now I’ll technically have finished my Latin minor requirements at the end of the semester. Graduating this year, although it’s definitely going to happen, may be a task. There won’t be much leeway as to what I can take next semester: I still have three requirements left for my major. So, there may be a balancing act that needs to be done in the process of scheduling. All my other classes seem good, though. Early Brit Lit, all the stuff that I’ve read or that I know I should’ve. A prof who talks about Grendel’s “anti-party monsterness”. South African Lit, the texts seem good, I don’t mind listening to the prof talk. But we watched a movie in the last class in the terrible heat and I kept nodding off while he was seated next to me. Then there’s Lifelong Writing, which so far seems to be twelve people in a room cracking jokes for two semesters. No wonder it was hard to get into. And, of course, the aforementioned Latin class. 190 I woke up this morning, knelt by my refrigerator, drank 3/4 of a quart of orange juice, then went back to sleep for another five hours. 191 The better my resume becomes, the poorer my childhood becomes. 192 A big new chunk of my upper-left wisdom tooth rotted out while I was sleeping. I’m examining a piece of it. 193 I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night and falling asleep in the late afternoon… which is better than it sounds. I’ve been staying on top of my classes. Was totally into talking about Njabulo Ndebele today. Not sure about the short responses for the British Literature class. We were assigned to create and explain an allegory after reading some parts of The Faerie Queene? And I did something about a chocolate forest that probably wasn’t what the instructor had in mind. “Creative” assignments trip me up. I’ll take a dry lecture over new and exciting methods of instruction any day. Speaking of dry lectures: Noam Chomsky is coming to campus Tuesday to talk on biolinguistics? I may go, just to see if I have any clue what the famous person is talking about. But George Saunders on Thursday. Him I can understand. Applying for Fiction M. F. A. s. Picky about where I’d go, though. Think I finally have a definite list. It might be a mistake if I didn’t think it through before going somewhere. All pretty reputable places. Putting in my best effort, though not all my eggs are in this basket. I’ve taken some opportunities to sit and watch leaves fall. 194 Oct. 7, 2005. Something about tonight. Rain and the leaves. Reading. Feeling dizzy at the gas station. And stopping at the mall because I suddenly want fried rice more than anything else. And the woman saying, “You can have some of any of these, with your rice. ” And I get a pained expression and say no, none of those. “Why?” I answer: “Because I’m frightened. ” My bookmark today is a document of my father’s retirement plan, with a sticky on it, “Keep this in your records, in case of my death. ” This morning, after the professor explained the syntax of some confusing sentence in Latin, one of my classmates said, “Y’know, I think it’s easier being a slave. ” And the professor said no, no! We’re of the literate class here! 195 Oct. 16. I do remember that before I made an ass of myself vomiting in the toilet at my cousin Alison’s wedding to her new husband, Steve Twigger, musician for the band Gaelic Storm (while my mother was there—in the men’s room—because I asked for her) I was having a good time. 196 One of the more nerve-wracking things I’ve done recently was to secure the third and final writer of recommendation letters for my writing program applications. I might have thought that I would feel relieved after this, but the fact still remains that I feel a lot like I did when I was, say, seventeen or eighteen. During that time of my life I kept feeling like I should be able to run away and start a life for myself. I felt like I had no established life, and no leads, in the place where I was. I kept trying to move, kept going to California, frantically following bright idea after bright idea about what was going to come next for me. But I kept coming back to the same place—living in my mom’s house, barely keeping my jobs, failing community college classes, scribbling experimental prose into notebooks, dreaming of a fresh start. The fact remains for me that I know how to pursue big ideas. I know how to make it seem like something major is going to change for me. The last time I went off to a faraway place in the hopes of starting anew, it was 2001 and the city was Portland. When I came back, my mom said, “I really thought it was going to work out for you, this time. ” I feel that there’s a shred of wisdom somewhere in my persistence. There are people who’ll complain about their environment, and who are truly unhappy with their way of life… but when push comes to shove, they won’t do anything to change, because they’re convinced that it’ll bring them nothing but failure. One thing I have going for me is that my resolve isn’t weakened by failure. But do I know how to choose my battles? Or do I keep on working in impractical ways toward irrelevant goals? That’s my question. My concerns are that I 1. ) don’t want to end up in poverty 2. ) want to stay creative and in an ongoing dialogue with other creative folks and 3. ) don’t want to feel like I’m trapped in a dead-end environment. As I sat down in my professor’s office, the first thing he said was, “That was quite a paper you handed in to me. I really don’t think I’ve ever seen that argument made before. ” I had been worried, of course. I’ve never gotten less than a grade of A on a critical essay for an English class, but I keep waiting for that bubble to burst. Because I was never actually taught to write papers. I had dropped out of high school my sophomore year, tested out of composition classes at community college. Taken one English class between 1996 and 2004. Then I decided to take advanced courses… and boom, I could do it. I was like, okay, I guess I should be an English major. But why couldn’t I have been so talented as, y’know, a waiter or something promising like that? Now, in this case, I had written about Nadine Gordimer, an author this professor has written about extensively. So it was like, okay, I guess I can write top-notch undergraduate English papers… but so what? I don’t want to write a critical dissertation or anything. I want to write stories and novels. And more importantly, I want to survive. Please, someone, tell me how to survive. I feel like so many of the opportunities usually available to college graduates presuppose involvement in the culture of successful students. Some awards. Some signs of “leadership”. It’s just expected. But I don’t feel like I’m the leader of anything. I feel like the guy in the TV series and film The Fugitive, escaped from somewhere. Desperate to prove that my escape is justified before They come and take me back. My transcripts? Well, at my current school, I have a 3. 8. At my last school, a 3. 0. The one before that, a 0. 9. Then, my resume is nonexistent. My only real credible strength that I know how to work with is my potential as a writer. To be a writer! How absurd to consider that the most practical of my options… 197 The last time I was awake felt less like a day and more like a… vortex. At least, that was what I was thinking at 8 AM, having spent the night working on a paper about a relatively obscure South African poet (Lesego Rampolokeng) as I walked to Herter Hall with my laptop in a bag and books in my arms, considering moreover the paper clipped application materials I wanted to give recommenders and (obsessively/neurotically) the imperfections! contained therein. I bought a coffee. Made it about 1/4 decaf because when I write papers I tend to push myself into the sort of over-tense and over-caffeinated state that makes me twitch and rock back and forth and look like who knows what; and I wasn’t in the privacy of my apartment but rather somewhere that made me a little more conscious of what I was doing. I found a place to sit on a couch and plug in the computer and work on the paper some more for an hour before one of my classes. A passing faculty-type person said, “Wow, you are quite ensconced there,” which I had her repeat because she said it quickly and I don’t usually hear people speak the word “ensconced”. In British Literature class, I got back the last essay I had written before today’s. The prof caught what I thought had been a veiled animosity toward the assignment, as he showed in his comments: “Thanks for this. You pushed past some of the absurdity of this assignment too find a larger purpose for the exercise… which was my hope. (…) My only suggestion is that you think a bit harder about the work your introductory paragraph can do for you. It my be that you found this assignment a bit academic (so to speak). ” He’s a sharp one. I finished the essay at the library. In South African Lit class we watched some of a documentary. It was actually really moving, but I don’t feel like writing about that. "

    "body": "198 My father likes to occasionally remind me that he wouldn’t approve of me having sex with men. His favorite way of doing it is sending me news articles like the most recent, which bears the subtle title, “Gay Sex Called Key to Rise in Syphilis”. 199 I am frightened, made nervous when my former instructor emails to suggest that we talk about my goals before she writes me a recommendation. Yesterday I watched a man on TV speak about Fidel Castro, and Castro has said, “I have never had a mentor. ” The speaker made great emphasis of this—for haven’t we all had mentors? No. We have not all had mentors. It is only that the successful tend to. Maybe I’m odd for having given up on even wanting for someone to tell me that I can do something. So I feel like no one anymore, except in relaxation on Alix’s couch or when I get to have conversation with any of the other various people who make me feel that I am pleasant to be around. Freedom is the blank canvas upon which masters and slaves incessantly paint each other. 200 I repeat. Freedom is the blank canvas upon which masters and slaves incessantly paint each other. 201 I went to this thing where a Teach For America video was shown. I left in the middle of it, put off. While they’re simplifying the process of becoming a teacher for the sort of students who have, you know, shown their leadership potential through volunteering and academic excellence and yadda yadda, I can’t help but wonder about the students who work their way through college as a cashier or something, who then would LOVE to have an opportunity like that. “Even though their yearly salary is about 35k, most of these young teachers say that the experience is worth it. ” That’s the point when I walked out. If I ever earn that much, you will find me crying tears of joy. 202 Because I operate in strange ways, I stopped by the mall today for the single purpose of using an ATM. (It somehow made sense at the time. ) Upon seeing a worker putting Christmas garlands up, my initial response was a very immediate and silent, Oh, fuck. Christmas. Which is weird. I didn’t know that I hated Christmas… but I guess I do, deep down. 203 Nov. 27. You visit. It’s you and her and her boyfriend and his friends. Her boyfriend and his friends are jovial as ever. Discussing anime and taking over the world. It had been his idea that having people over would be good—to brighten her mood, to save her from a depression. You and she are still the sort who would sooner go with the pain, feel it, let it out. Every once in awhile, you make eye contact. The others are laughing. You’re ready to graduate from college. You’re applying to grad schools. The one other woman who is in the house goes to help her into the wedding dress. The boyfriend stays in the living room: he’s not allowed to see her in the dress, yet. She’s standing in her wedding dress. In many ways she remains a mystery to you. But you’ve come to understand something about her. Her mysterious nature—the quality that makes her life a series of battles, tragedies, triumphs, and drastic changes—that nature, which still makes you question at times how much you really know about her, and how much of your perception of her is a fabrication, is a quality that’s present in you as well. It’s a mysteriousness that comes from having survived a certain type of change, a certain type of personal shift. After she’s changed back from the wedding dress, you’re sitting in the living room, drinking wine out of a cup. She asks you if you’d like a wine glass. You go into the dark kitchen. She grabs glasses. She grabs her own wine bottle. “I hope that you and I can always do this,” you say, weirdly, as she struggles with the corkscrew. 204 The past several days I have largely spent in the university library, the outside view of which this morning impressed me for the first time. I don’t know whether it’s because my recent days have been spent only dealing with small things when not with abstractions—stirring cream into a cup of coffee, microwaving a Gardenburger on a paper towel—giving me a diminished perspective from which familiar objects can suddenly appear startling, almost sublime; or perhaps that I am just, in some way, regaining a consciousness of the outside world that I lost when I cocooned. 205 It was a pretty good New Year’s Eve. It was snowing; the highway was an unhappy place. There were people I was glad to be hanging out with, people I wished could have made it. I eventually tried to drive home, but my car’s starter decided that its new year’s resolution would be to stop functioning. In the morning I called AAA for a tow, which became an infuriating process. It ultimately took four hours for a truck to arrive, an hour and a half of which I spent sitting in the cold of my car thinking, Hm, I’m hungry and can’t feel my toes, but whatever… I can sit and read and other parts of which I spent inside feeling rather aggravated but better as time progressed, watching people play video games. Family relations turned out able to help with the car, and now I’m at home again, where the ceiling of my bathroom leaks disconcertingly from the fan thing on my bathroom ceiling, dripping slowly but noticeably into a puddle that, although it is small, frightens me and causes me to stand on the side rather than in front of the toilet when I pee standing up. (I don’t like the droplets of water falling onto my shoulders and head. ) Which maybe doesn’t sound like a great holiday, but I liked it just fine, and there are plenty of reasons to be excited about the new year. 206 Jan. 19, 2006. Dean’s Book class (the second of three 1-credit courses needed for graduation through the Honors college) is frustrating, only because I’m having a tough time approaching the presentation and paper that I need to do. I just plain don’t know how to write a paper that’s not literary criticism. It would be absurd to drop it at this point… the assignment’s very small, there are only two days of class left. 207 “You’re the one I know to call when everything falls apart,” Alix says as her breakup is happening. I hold her while she cries about just wanting to trust him. “What you’re afraid might come true can’t be as bad as what the fear is doing to you,” I say. 208 Odor control spray has maybe somewhat ameliorated the mysterious stench that has been worsening since I moved into my apartment six months ago. But only maybe and only somewhat. 209 Here I am in Northampton. There’s a slight drizzle. People in front of me are taking pictures of themselves: “Say whiskey!” says the woman with curled hair, using a high-pitched voice. They take turns using the camera. “There’s this guy I met in New York, and I just got in touch with him through MySpace… he’s really hot,” somebody is saying. “It’s my day off. I’m ugly,” I think I hear someone say, after the picture-taking group has moved on and a new one has formed. An ambulance drives by with its sirens on. I’m on the small step in front of a jewelry and sculpture store. A mirror is opposite me. I’m also near the new solar-powered trash compactor on the sidewalk. An old man is vomiting about twenty meters down from me… or at least spitting up and sounding like he’s choking. I think I see a boombox by his feet. Automobiles drive by. A police officer on a bicycle with a brightly-colored backpack. The old man is still making vomit sounds. My hair is messy and I hate being alone. “Oh, it’s snowing!” says a woman leaving Haymarket. I look to the streetlight and notice that she’s right. “How can the town just go to sleep at 6 o’clock?” asks someone. The light above me keeps going on, then off, then on again. I’m drinking coffee, but what would really hit the spot is soda, water, and a strawberry milkshake with whipped cream. I don’t know what else to think of. As a child, I always had a hard time falling asleep, and being forced to lie in bed was really boring, and I would ask my father, “Dad! What should I think about?” He never had enough suggestions for me. “Think of playing with your friends,” he would say, night after night, “Think of playing with your friends. ” 210 To draw a picture of my life as it is at present: hiding inside. Playing video games, even. Watching the same downloaded episodes of the same television programs, over and over. The sort of interlude in which I have free time, but it’s not really the fun sort of free time. 211 I failed my intersession class, presumably. I felt clueless as to how to approach an assigned essay/presentation on Marty Jezer’s memoir about life with stuttering. So just didn’t show up the day of my assigned presentation, nor for the wrap-up day. So much for graduation through the Honors college. I thought I was going to set my alarm—yeah, I’ll B. S. something in the morning—but I slept through. (I think my brain sabotages me when I’m not doing a good enough job with myself. ) I’ve been seeing some more of the Northampton scene—Tina, Harvey, Kelsey, Cassie, Gaby, Vespa Eric, a Sarah who I still haven’t come up with a good adjective for. So I’ve been able to show up in town and hang out and chat and spend time at Diva’s. This is where I saw Maurice on Thursday. We talked about writing. I like being able to talk about writing. Oh yeah. I did my feature at Jester’s, the coffee place in Westfield, after Lori Desrosiers invited me to read there. I chose both poetry and fiction. I’ve been checking my mail obsessively. I’m really very much expecting my rejection or acceptance to the University of British Columbia tomorrow/today. I don’t know why I think it’s so important that I get into one of these programs. I need to go somewhere and just live. I’m still very tense. Productivity has been low. Some writing in progress, but mostly it’s been a matter of just living for tomorrow. Maurice said he thinks I’ve done all that I can in this area. He’s in favor of my leaving. Helena, of course, still says I should leave. (She’s in New York. ) Tina also says that she’s going to New York. I haven’t been thinking too much on the idea of going to New York myself, though… strangely enough, for a writer. 212 I empathize with Alix. Her panic becomes my panic. She needs to calm down and asks that I bring her to my place. She kisses me. “I hope this is okay. I don’t want to hurt you,” she says, “Because… I don’t know what I’m doing with myself. ” She asks, “Do you think we might end up together… find out we’re right for each other?” I confidently inform her that I have no idea. She says, “Now isn’t the right time. But I think in, say, five years…” “Somebody else told me that… five years ago, actually,” I said, “And, needless to say, it didn’t work out. ” Then I silently remember other, similar things that have been said to me by past lovers. For some reason, people just like planning faithful partnerships with me many years in advance. How we understand each other is real enough. And I know what she means… there would be no feasible long-term strategy for a relationship together between the two of us… but she says, “In a lot of ways, I’ll still be comparing others to you. ” You know. My depth of emotion. My empathy. My understanding that life can’t always be smiles. And we were slow dancing without music in the hallway. “Why do I feel like I’m 70 years old?” I pondered aloud, “I guess because I’m feeling world-weary, and I’m slow dancing. ” Then she said, “Not world-weary of me, right?” and I gave her a look: “You aren’t the world. ” Neither of us seems to lead, and we just hold each other and step. Later, I said to her, “I’m not going to invest myself in what might happen someday. I’m not going to pine after you. I’m just going to keep loving you, the way I’ve always done. ” 213 A cozy attic living space in a hose in Holyoke. Alix is lying down with her Cultural Anthropology book. (One hand supporting her head. ) One of my feet (I’m wearing black socks) keeps my journal book open. I was reading Titus Andronicus, but eventually my attention was getting away from me. This place is a part of where her cousins live. (She brought a bag of Chex Mix up for me in case I wanted that as a snack. It’s unopened on the floor next to her papers from school. ) I don’t quite know where we stand, and I would feel bad for asking. And at times like this I lift my head to look at her and feel like there’s something wrong with that. Like I should leave her alone. 214 “What are you thinking about?” asked Alix. “Us,” I said, to be honest. It seems like we’re in limbo—of course—but I guess the difference is that we both know/have agreed on this? “Promise me you’ll be all right,” she said. I promised, and told her, “It’s cool, because like, I can go to you like ‘Omigod omigod!’ and you’re like ‘It’s okay’ and I’m like ‘Okay. ’” Oh, and I asked her, “Am I too emotional?” and she said, “No. If you weren’t so emotional, you wouldn’t understand me so well. ” 215 For a while I was on a desperate search for motivation and inspiration. This led me to try and be a socialite again for much of this January. Tentatively going to this more emotional place with Alix is so much a strong cure for that desperation that I want to be eating well, working, reading, writing, recording songs, exercising. I want to be doing it all. 216 I don’t really feel like I’m back in school. I blame that on the fact that my courses don’t really feel like work. Yeah, it’s four English classes, but one is a writing workshop and two are 200-level. Read a bunch, write a little about what I read? Okay. But even though I’m close to having my college degree, I still instinctively feel impressed when I learn that somebody graduated from high school. Part of me still thinks, Who does that? Who is so resilient as to put up with high school for an entire four years? 217 Waiting to see an advisor for Commonwealth College, the Honors program here at UMass… I’m withdrawing from that. It’s good to be awake during the day. I went to discussion sections for American Identities and Shakespeare today, after spending the night at Alix’s. I had actually gotten my sleep Thursday afternoon, but with Alix sleeping on my chest I was adrift half in dream, half in thought for a few hours before getting up and reading. Oh, and yesterday I received a rejection from the University of British Columbia. Ideas for what to do today: go to the Registry of Motor Vehicles to see how I can get a new license. 218 So I spent four nights in a row sleeping in the same room with Alix. There was a decline in how okay this was on Tuesday night, which was Valentine’s Day, and put me at too vulnerable a place. No. No, I just got awkward, and was awkward again in the morning. Sometimes she makes me feel better instantaneously when I get like that; other times she gets nervous and I get more nervous and it’s one of our weird times. Too much tension, I guess. But the weekend felt very beautiful… now things have to be more practical, and I remember how strange a position I’m in. I won’t turn down the opportunity of a good school for her, but if I don’t get in anywhere, well, I would like to try for something serious. She doesn’t want to make any promises yet about not seeing other people, but she “won’t do anything that will hurt me”? What does that mean? 219 Whispered conversation carried out between Alix and me during Breakback Mountain: (5 minutes in) She: “I get the impression that they’re gay cowboys. ” Me: “Yes. ” (15 minutes in) She: “They’re gay cowboys. ” Me: “Definitely gay cowboys. ” (45 minutes in) She: “Gay cowboys. ” Me: “Gay cowboys. ” (1 hr. 15 minutes in) She: “They’re gay cowboys…” Me: “They’re gay… cowboys…” (1 hr. 45 minutes in) She: “They’re… gay… cowboys…” Me: “Gay cowboys… (bumping my head against seat) gay cowboys… (bumping my head against seat) gay cowboys… (bumping my head against seat) gay cowboys. ” I was surprised to find that this was the movie people had been raving about. All I took away from it, really, was that they were gay cowboys. 220 I had a remarkable weekend with Alix. I met her at a party at Leigh’s, then we and Lyric came back to my apartment and talked in the kitchen for awhile. We dropped off Lyric, Alix stayed over, during the day we went shopping and the supermarket was very crowded. Both she and I were buying food for our respective places. We dropped off my food at my place, then picked up Lyric again and went to Alix’s, where Alix changed her clothes. Then we were hoping to go outside, like to a park or something, but it was getting late and cold and so instead we went to Northampton and drank coffee at Haymarket. Then we dropped Lyric off and Alix stayed over again. In the morning it was snowing—a big blizzard in other parts of the region, but here not so much. And I drove Alix home. It felt like the time we had spent had been a wonderful forever. 221 Mar. 6, 2006. I’m on the wait list in Fiction for the Creative Writing Program at Syracuse. "

    "body": "222 I was at Alix’s, and we were talking about our plans to go to the nightclub in Springfield that she used to frequent, years before, when she was more of a partier. And we were saying how it would be fun, etc. etc. , and then she said, “I’m really looking forward to dancing. Are you going to get mad if I end up dancing with guys or something?” And I kind of shrugged and said, “Well, y’know, I should be fine. ” Then, in a teasing voice: “Just, y’know, don’t be touching them too much. ” At which point she suddenly looked serious and said, “It’s kind of hard to dance with someone without touching them. ” “Well, I know,” I said, “That’s why I said ‘too much’. But, I don’t know. I guess I don’t really know about the dancing at clubs like this. You should show me. ” “Without music?” And so we tried to simulate dancing together in a top 40/urban/techno nightclub without music, but that didn’t work out. Cut to that evening: An automobile with decorations, things painted or glued on or glittered, the outside of the vehicle decorated. Leigh drives slowly on the highway, uses her hands to demonstrate and punctuate the things she’s saying to Alix, who is in the front passenger’s seat. So the automobile keeps swerving, a couple times at least, rightward into the shoulder, so that the ride becomes bumpy and Leigh goes, “Whoa!” and then pays attention again. Lyric and Joe are sort of cuddled in the back seat, to my left. I called the right-hand rear seat, because that one’s my favorite. We get into Springfield and, unexpectedly, I’m the one having to navigate, because I have somewhat of a clue how to get where we’re going, but we keep missing the turns: “Take your next left,” I say, but we don’t. Eventually we get to the parking lot near the club, we’re waiting behind a red truck and Leigh says, “Whoa, 666 on that car, plus it’s a red truck!” “Why does it matter that it’s red?” I ask. “You know, blood is red, and it just seems evil. ” “Oh, right,” I said, “And red like paintings of the devil and stuff. ” We wait in line for the nightclub. Alix goes in, Leigh goes in, I go in. I’m following them when Lyric, from behind me, grabs my arm: “They’re not letting Joe in, because his license is expired. ” I tell Leigh about this. What are we going to do? But she’s already lost Alix. So we start walking through the crowded dance floor, packed with boys-and-girls and girls-and-girls grinding with each other, and my knee-jerk disgust at the scene kicks in: How could she want to go here so badly? Here in specific? There are so many places to dance. And as soon as we walk in, she disappears, leaves us? We find her: she had walked into the other room. We explain the situation. Leigh goes outside to talk with Lyric and Joe, who decide to go to a billiards place down the road that they had noticed. Alix gives us a tour. We get some drinks. We watch a hot body contest, at which I just shake my head and laugh, while Alix is telling Leigh and me the story about the one time she signed up for one of those contests and won. (“That was the thing, the four girls before me just went up and danced. It’s a hot body contest; you’ve got to show some skin!”) We just keep dancing, then, for something like an hour and a half. It’s great. We’ve mostly avoided the biggest room in the club, which is the one that distressed me upon arriving; but around fifteen minutes before closing, we go there. We dance a little, it’s okay, but then I start to feel uncomfortable, and I’m not sure why. “I want to go upstairs again!” I say. Alix ignores me; we all keep dancing. A guy starts dancing near her, so I start dancing with her, but then he only dances with her closer, and she starts moving with him. I back off, take a look around at where I am. I panic; being with her has kept me from freaking out in this place. I’m scared, I’m angry. I say, “I’m going into the other room. Come find me, or leave me. ” I start to walk away. She follows. She’s smiling: “Was that bothering you, with that other guy?” I’m struggling for words. How can I explain, in this nightclub, that I fail in situations of masculine competitiveness, that I’m the Faggy Loser because I can’t butt heads… that in this place of people who want to be hot bodies, she’s the only one I want… and that without the attention of someone I know, this club is my own personal Hell, giving me flashbacks to my youth, when I thought that my stubborn unwillingness to be macho, or to treat members of the opposite sex as prizes to be won, meant that I would never be accepted by friends, let alone by a lover? I try to explain, while we’re standing at the edge of the dance floor. A different guy, then, comes up and disrupts the conversation to start dancing with her. She dances with him. I just stand there. This guy I don’t even look at; I just talk to Alix. “Will you come have a cigarette with me?” “Yeah. ” It’s meaningless, she’s coming home with me, etc. etc. I keep telling her: I’m not judging her, I know that it’s meaningless, I know that she loves me… I just can’t deal with this experience. She says that she’s sorry, she doesn’t want to do anything that will hurt me, and she hopes that I’ll still want to come again sometime. When we go back inside from having the cigarette, we find Leigh. The club is closing. Alix and I sit on the hood of Leigh’s car while waiting for her to get into the car and unlock the other doors. We’re still going over the experience of the night. “Yeah,” I say, “The dancing was great, I was having a lot of fun, up to a certain point. ” Next to us, the red truck with the 666 license plate honks its horn. Without saying anything to me, Alix stands up, goes to the window, and has a conversation. Her recollection of the conversation was that it was something like this: “Hey, I know you have a boyfriend, but I wanted to you know, there are a lot of men here who think you’re really beautiful. ” “Is that why you were honking your horn?” “Yeah. I hope your boyfriend knows that you’re beautiful. ” “I think he knows. ” There was also more banter than that. All that I personally heard was her saying, “I think he knows. ” She later says that she was brushing them off, being a bitch. I ask, can we go in the car now? We do. Lyric and Joe arrive from the billiards place, and take their seats. Leigh turns the ignition. The guys from the 666 truck start screaming obscenities at us, banging on the windows, making like they’re going to break one of the windows with a flashlight. “Just go,” someone says. So Leigh pulls out, and drives us out of the parking lot. “What were they doing?” one of us asks. “Well, I hit the side of their car with the door when I got in,” says Joe. “Don’t worry about it,” says Alix, “It has nothing to do with their car and everything to do with the fact that they got fucking denied. ” We drive out. “Which way do I go?” asks Leigh. “Left,” I say. “Right,” Alix says. Leigh goes right. Eventually we have to turn around. At this point, we realize that we’re being followed by the 666 truck. Someone says to call the cops. “Are we really calling the cops?” I say. “Yes,” says Alix, who places the call. We keep driving. The truck keeps following. Alix is telling the operator where we are as we pass street signs; we’re told that a cruiser will meet us in a certain parking lot. Leigh starts to turn into that parking lot. “No, keep driving in circles until we see the cruiser,” someone says, but at that point the truck drives off. Alix says that she has to pee immediately. We stop at a convenience store. “I think this is the same place I stopped at on the way to that keg party last week,” Alix says. “I like to get out and have fun,” she says on the ride home. “Me too,” I say, “But by that I mean… I had fun when we went bowling. And going to the park with the swingset and slides. ” But I have to admit: the way we each can change, acting like different people in different situations… the way we can adjust our lifestyles, direction, purpose… is why people see Alix and me in action, talking to each other, and know that, for better or for worse, for good or for evil, there’s a complex, deep, intense relationship that exists between us. We spent the next two days with each other, relaxing and talking. 223 I got my NYU rejection while Alix was on my computer looking for apartments. Then I was sitting around and she was asking how I felt and so I was thinking about all the things I have to think about—what will I do in this scenario, in that? And I wanted to wait for the funk to pass but she was saying, “No, let’s go out, let’s go to a park or something. ” I wasn’t prepared for the outside world and it made me panicked and I was hungry and didn’t know where we were going, only that she had pushed me to get out of the house. I drive past her house, then we’re gonna eat somewhere, so I say we’ll go to Bernie’s in Chicopee, where my Mom works, and we’ll drive through my old neighborhood so I can point out things to Alix, then we pull into the parking lot at Bernie’s and she says, “Don’t be mean to me” and I say, “Okay, don’t be mean to me. ” And she says, “What do you mean?” and I talk about, I dunno, I don’t like feeling like I can’t just work through my feelings, don’t like being forced into doing what I don’t want to do as a supposed way to make me feel better. “I want to go home,” she says. 224 May 7, 2006. I dunno. A few weeks ago, Alix and I had been talking about living together, until she mentioned in passing that she was looking for a place by herself… and I said, But, y’know, it seems like this is the direction we’re going, being serious with each other, and isn’t it a good idea, more convenient, etc? and she said that she didn’t want to make the mistake of moving too quickly into that sort of thing, like she did in her last relationship… which made sense. I spoke my side, she spoke hers, I was going to have to understand that she had come to a decision… until problems emerged with her current living situation and she wanted to get out as soon as possible, and she started thinking that maybe we could live together after all, but with a mutual friend there, too… and I was like, well, yeah, that sounds like a good idea. But then it was seeming as though, contrary to expectations, it might be more affordable for just the two of us to live together… but I don’t think we really talked through that. Then we were having general difficulties communicating with each other for a time, both being stressed out about this n’ that. Finally we had a Good Talk about hurt feelings, etc. (a Good Talk, as opposed to the couple of Bad Talks we’d had—Bad Talks being our patient, low-volume but bitter and grueling substitution for where other people would likely have shouting matches)… and during that Good Talk she was saying, if things were going to get like that, like it gets in the Bad Talks, then she just couldn’t deal with us living together until we could improve on that… and I said I knew what she meant, and apologized that I had made her feel bad about not being ready to live with me. By that point, I was thinking the same thing: the Bad Talks really scared me, too, plus I wasn’t convinced that she was convinced that it was a good idea for us to live together, and I had started thinking to myself about all the possible reasons why we shouldn’t. But after our Good Talk, she started talking about how nice it would be for us to live together, because in the Good Talk we had finally put our communications issues to some resolution… and the day that followed was really good and we were happy together again, as we usually are. But after a long period of time spent together, and her talking more and more about how nice it would be to live together and what the curtains will look like and which furniture we should use, I told her that this excitement of hers seemed really sudden, and I hadn’t had time to adjust to the idea that she wanted us to live together at all. Then I voiced some of my own concerns about the potential arrangement: I need you to understand that for the direction my life is going, this is what’s important for me to have in terms of lifestyle, etc. And that seemed good, she had an answer for everything. But the next morning she was talking about finances, and she asked if I was worried about her being able to come up with the money, and I said yes. But really, my concern was that she would be willing to overwork herself, yes, but that I couldn’t bear to see her do that and that I would end up working myself just as hard but in such a way that I couldn’t, y’know, advance my or our situation, because I have limited confidence in my ability to literally survive and I would be scared to take on more financial responsibility than I thought I could handle before I felt more secure about my capacity in that regard… Now that I’m thinking all of this through on my own, it seems like the situation between us, if we were going to be move in together, could work out well in the long, long run. But as so often happens (and so often leads to Bad Talks) it was bad timing when the topic was raised this last time, early in the morning, and I was very hungry and groggy, in no condition to really work through my fears about the situation, but I knew it would have been dishonest not to say “yes” when she asked if I was having second thoughts. So I said “I’m sorry” and hung my head as we were parked in front of her place, while she talked about feeling jerked around by my changing my mind so many times. I felt sure, in the moment, that she was right, and that I had done her wrong. But considering it now, I think I just get overwhelmed that she adjusts to changes in her plans so easily. And when she left the car she said, “It’s not going to happen, even if you change your mind again. ” 225 So now all there is left is one week, then I’ll have that there college degree. Who knew that I wasn’t just being delusional again when I started at GCC, after failing out at HCC so many times? And what have I learned through all this? Well, I’ve learned that being a serious college student can sort of feel like a cross between stealing a large sum of money from your neighbors (or how I imagine that would feel) and beating yourself with a whip until it starts to feel good (also, how I imagine that would feel). But it also, in my case, has felt like getting a bunch of personal development (and reading) out of the way during a relatively short span of years. 226 May 24. One final left. Tomorrow. Still trying to decide if I’m going to the commencement ceremony. The last paper I had to write I decided to be adventurous with. I combined a final paper assignment—to write any sort of paper on anything having to do with books—with a 1-credit independent study, and over the course of several nights I journaled my way through all twenty-six floors of the university library, contemplating my English major and the greater purpose of literary study. The hours flew by while I was writing it, but I’m not really sure what the professor will think of it. 227 June 5. I remember… I woke up with the lights on at about 5:30 this morning. The book I had been reading was still next to me. (Yesterday I kept inside, except for a run to the convenience store. ) I didn’t feel desperate for coffee, but made it anyway. I changed my Livejournal username, because I had been meaning to do that. Yesterday researching career opportunities… for more information please visit our website… mouseovering the “human resources” tab. To whom it may concern, I am writing in response. I am able to offer. Before that, a party, which seemed over before I remembered to mingle. 228 I spent all day yesterday just hanging around my apartment and reading about 9/11. I napped about three times, intentionally, to prepare to stay up all night for work. I emailed one resume. I worked the overnight shift with the manager at my side. Another thing I forgot about working at convenience stores is just how often I find myself wondering if I’m on a hidden camera television show (until I remember that it’s 4 AM, long past the bedtime of most production crews). The quiet hours mean that interactions with problem customers can last for ages… The forty-five minutes spent being patient with a man who had limited English skills, who said that he needed to call his mother in Mexico, but who seemed more interested in arguing that we were ripping him off with the phone cards we sold? Which was a long and gradual shift from a run of the mill transaction to a real headache. Complete with the theatrical closing argument about how we should think about how he was just looking for help, and how we should think about how someday we might want somebody to help us out… and how he was mistreated “because he doesn’t speak the language”. I remember now—the way the customers you work the hardest to try helping will very often be the first to claim that you haven’t been trying at all. It’s hard to tell whether they really believe what they’re saying, or if they’re just that lonely in the middle of the night that they want to interact with somebody, somehow… There are actually far more customers who’ll look down on you during a day shift. Commuters getting gas, hurried, wanting a refill of the Splenda packets and raising their voices in that sort of you’d better do everything perfectly, you lowly sales associate sort of way. The overnight customers are the less competitive types—the lonely, the desperate, the contented, the excited. These are the people I prefer to deal with. These are more my types of people. 229 Jo the sex worker walks into the store while I’m working with my manager. “Whoa! Levi Adams! You work here now?” “Yes, I do. I’m here all night. ” “Here all night. Well, I suppose that’s a good use for the sleepless nights you might otherwise mistake for inspiration. ” “I don’t understand…” “You don’t understand! You’re working here, a tortured artist like yourself. You should follow my lead, try the black market instead. Make something of yourself!” (Then she’s at the register, with a man) “Are you still poly?” she asks. “No, I’m not. ” “No? And pray tell, why not?” “Circumstances change. ” “Or maybe you got too scared. ” “Well, I imagine that’s a matter of opinion. ” “Uh huh. Well, bye. I’m glad to run into you. ” “Yeah, same here. ” The door closes. The manager looks at me, curious. “Someone’s trying to talk you into a change of career?” “Well, you know. You know somebody, and they know somebody, and you see them around years later. ” “Yes,” he nods. “That’ll always happen. You just have to learn not to let it get to you. ” "

I’m in Atlanta! 24 Too early in the morning for me to appreciate the bearded man coming and chatting. It’s my morning cup of coffee here at Village Coffee House, Little Five Points, Atlanta, and I’ve broken my latest pair of eyeglasses already (I’m gonna hunt for a repair kit) so I’m squinting and it’s just too early for me to chat, sorry, Scooter. “Are you a hippie?” he asked, so I had to reply that I wasn’t. We came down around here last night, Stacy and Andre had picked me up, and we were with a couple of their friends and got pizza before renting a movie, going back to the apartment where Brian pulled up video of Bush II remixed, assembled into ephemera accessible from a bitstream download, as another generation feigns unique and plays with propaganda. But hey, Scooter, I’m not really here for the sights, though I thank you for the pointers. It’s like you said after I agreed to your pulling up a chair, there’s fakeness in how these cities are built, and I’m just passing through, I’m just ephemera accessible from a bitstream download. I’m a part of where I am, that’s what I am, and what I am is moving. I logged into my account at the University of New Orleans web system. All that was listed in my personal profile was that I should meet with an advisor to schedule classes. The “hold” for that letter I sent is gone. Maybe that means they’ve accepted me? I plan to find out when I roll into New Orleans, which, I’m thinking, will be tomorrow. Sorry that’s not the real Louisiana, Scooter. But, yeah, anyway, the folks I’m staying with are very familiar-seeming. Comfortable. Stacy and Andre’s daughter said she liked me, yay! It’s getting hot outside. A shower is definitely on my agenda for the day. 25 New Orleans, Louisiana. I’m here slightly after the opening time of UNO’s Admissions Office. The unfortunate severity of the heat outside is more noticeable when I confront it after exiting this air conditioned interior. I just arrived in this city a few hours ago, walked around for a bit and asked transit workers I encountered about how I might find the school. Then I walked some more, and asked a person I saw on the campus where I could find the Admissions Office. So, that’s how I found my way here. What would be amazing: if I could find out everything I need to know about this school today, if I could hear that I’ve been accepted, and if I could find out every little thing about the housing I would miraculously have no problem getting. Too much to hope for? Yes. So instead of hoping I’m just sitting here, with my eye on the Admissions Office, not planning what I’ll say to anyone, just relaxing and taking advantage of this safe space by writing in my journal. Not much happened during the remainder of my stay in Atlanta. But that was good! I played ball with a small child for ridiculous lengths of time. Stacy and Andre both worked and errands were run and all, but I felt welcomed and that’s the most I would have thought to hope for. The overnight bus ride was not spectacular in the way of allowing me break time, but it was quite a speedy way of passing from Georgia through Alabama and Mississippi into Louisiana. Overnight, in the darkness, I kept thinking of everything I absolutely needed to write into this journal. Then I forgot all of it. I won’t be meeting with the online friend I thought I would see here—his schedule’s crazy right now, it turns out—and that means I don’t have a place to stay. I need to do laundry and I’m not a fan of extreme heat. Also, with all the places I’ve been, I’m really not all that excited at the idea of fleetingly stepping on soil in Florida, Arkansas, Kentucky or Michigan. (These, the only states in the continental U. S. I haven’t been to, are the leading contenders for places to visit. ) So I’m thinking of calling up Bluejay and saying “Hey, you offered to hang out/put me up if I wanted to stop by Philly on the way back. How does Saturday sound?” Because, leaving from here tonight, I figure that’s probably when I’d get back. If I had managed to get a hold of Silvia to work out details, then I’d have California as something to look forward to. I mean. There are places I could go, to visit with people, but not really stay. I dunno. I feel like the experience of leaving on this trip, having that great unknown in front of me, was the exhilarating part. Maybe I’ll find out, now, what’s happening in the fall. Maybe it’ll be postponed and I won’t have anything arranged until entirely the last minute. Maybe the last piece of this year-long puzzle I’ve put together will turn out to have mutated since I figured out where I was going to put it. Maybe failure is still an option! Maybe, lots of maybes. But who’ve I got to prove myself to, anymore, anyway? More administrative faculty are entering the building. I found Chewy Centered Gobstoppers at a convenience store where the bus stopped in Mississippi. I love those things. 26 Ohh, I get it. My cell phone still has Eastern Time on it, so I thought the time was an hour later than it actually is. No wonder my mom was still asleep when I called her. I must seem even more ridiculous than I originally thought, then, for sitting out here waiting for the offices to open. Ah, that’s me, always making a fool of myself. 27 Waiting for access to some information. Already I’ve researched, over telephone, the possible scheduling of my return trip; or rather, a trip so far as to land me back in Philadelphia. Something has shifted in me and I want leisure. Right now I’d like to place a videocassette into its player, and sip some juice, barefoot on a couch. And then, to fall asleep without worry… I only got about fifteen minutes’ sleep. That’s contributing to my current state of mind. Maybe I’ll find a hotel before I go, sleep all day and catch a morning bus. Maybe, maybe. 28 Oh, don’t worry, Charlotte Public Library. I’m not smuggling a Madeleine L’Engle book into my bag. I’ll pay the twenty-five cents you demand for this (autographed by the author, if anyone would look inside) copy of A Ring of Endless Light I found among the shelves of withdrawn books. (for Tait Arend- Be a Light Bearer Madeleine L’Engle) So, yeah. New Orleans was quite an experience. Nothing happened, really, except that it was New Orleans and I’m Levi from Massachusetts. The weather—I couldn’t believe the weather. It rained four times (thundering twice) in the eight hours I was there, and when it wasn’t showering I was becoming terribly drenched by my sweat. UNO said to me a bunch of words, but all the words really meant was, “We’ve got nothing to tell you today”. By then I was terribly overtired—this was a big part of the madness I was already feeling. Then I waited at a bus stop, the humidity accosting me, making my mind start to panic, to think of any alternate plan, anything that could get me inside to some place air-conditioned AT THAT MOMENT, and when I wasn’t doing that to my mind I was falling asleep, sitting up, at the bus stop, looking, presumably, like I was strung out on something. I’m glad I’m taking this time in Charlotte. I figure I wouldn’t be writing anything at all today. The bus ride has been, like, argh, argh, gnaw on arm. 29 A coffee shop! (But also so much more: a deli, that has sushi for sale, even. ) This whole thing about the American South forcing me to take only powdered non-dairy creamer in my coffee, which seemed like a funny running joke several days ago, HAS STOPPED BEING FUNNY. So I finally got on the bus to take me back to downtown New Orleans, and I was still dozing off every few seconds, and then the bus driver was telling me, “You’ve gotta get off here. Take a transfer. You can take the trolley downtown. ” Then I stumbled around the outside of the bus and stared at the departing trolley—trying to figure out how I was supposed to board it, if I could board it at that moment, WHAT WAS GOING ON?! Then it left, so I started to walk. It was drizzling. There was a cemetery. I took pictures, because I thought maybe I have gothy friends who’d like to see a New Orleans cemetery. A few feet down, there was another. I hopped over, and walked around, the large, flooded portions of the sidewalk. Houses houses houses, just a bunch of ‘em. Too bad I don’t have an eye for architecture, or I’d tell you what they looked like. I found a pharmacy and used their one-hour services to get my film developed. Meanwhile, I walked until I finally reached some restaurants. New Orleans was making me nervous. The woman in line with me buying friend chicken at Popeye’s appeared to have brought a sword with her, in a sheath of velvet? is what my eyes told me, but when you’re barely awake and a stranger in a strange land, you don’t stare at the weaponry of the locals. Then I ordered my chicken, but the woman behind the register and I each could seem to comprehend nothing of what the other said: I think my accent was too strong, and she was using terminology I couldn’t for the life of me comprehend. I would have ordered a “po’ boy” somewhere for novelty factor, since “po’ boys” are on all menus there, but I had a genuine fear of being told, “No. Go home” if I tried to say the words, “po’ boy”. Then I would have been chased by aggressors all through the French Quarter, and I would have needed to jump kick them and steal their weapons like in The Adventures of Bayou Billy. I must have been a sight to behold, my sweat-drenched long hair in front of my face while I carried my Eastpak backpack, gasping for breath as my sweat-soaked Strangers in Paradise t-shirt clang to me. When I exited a trolley and immediately walked into three lanes of oncoming traffic, I started to think, okay, yeah, I’m really gonna head home early. So, yeah. Deciding to haphazardly wander around New Orleans in July carrying a heavy bag when I already just wanted a shower, clean clothes and sleep, was probably the dumbest ‘adventure’ I’ve had in awhile. I made my way back to the bus terminal. Got in touch with Alix again. We talked for awhile—I’ve actually figured out how to use my cell phone, mostly—and it was really good. She said she was spending the day by not answering the door and watching videos (IN THE AIR CONDITIONED LIVING ROOM OF HER APARTMENT! I thought to myself) and so, all things considered, wow, did I really want to be there with her. Other music I’ve been listening to on this trip: Willie Nelson- Super Hits Rasputina- Frustration Plantation The Postal Service- Give Up Alanis Morissette- So-Called Chaos Now I’ve been taking express buses north, which means that I’ve been crammed next to people like that old woman who slept on my shoulder and the young woman who wrapped herself in a Scooby-Doo blanket. The lack of mobility one has in such situations is something you’ll never understand unless you’ve been through it, particularly when it’s for three hours, then you get five minutes and you have to decide Will I have a cigarette? Or get a drink? What do I drink? Should I hydrate myself, up my blood sugar, caffeinate myself? Should I eat? Change the CD in my player? Use the restroom? Okay, now it’s time for me to grab some food. 30 Ah, yes, a bar and grill aimed at college students. Perfect. Even the generally disconcerting sound of “We Built This City” is welcome right now. Oh, hell, they’re actually playing the music video for it on their television screens. Which I strangely can’t keep my eyes diverted from… (hold on, I gotta watch the rest of it) and now Georgia Satellites is picking up where Starship left off. 31 Back in Washington, D. C. at the bus terminal. All day I’ve been in the same bus, in the same seat, with the same guy next to me. I read the entirety of that Madeleine L’Engle book. That plus the Tom Wolfe (Hooking Up) makes two (short) books I’ve read on this trip. So, yeah. So this is it, the last day of my trip. Time to reboard… or so I thought. They announced, emphatically, that we were to reboard, but didn’t announce where to do so. I asked the first person in a Greyhound uniform I came across (which took awhile) and she just sent me to wait in line with all the folks who just are waiting to board for the first time. Then the bus was filled to capacity, and we were told that another would leave with the rest of us in two minutes. It’s been fifteen minutes or so. With emphasis on the “or so”. And every employee with whom one of us tries to communicate disavows any knowledge of anything having to do with buses to New York. 32 When I was in DC, waiting for a bus to NYC: the businessman making a huge deal about the terrible service, how we were waiting for long periods of time without explanation, how when he tried to talk to employees they walked away, ignoring him, etc. And the old army vet he complained to. And the lady who told him to stop making a scene, asking what he was hoping to accomplish, and his response, “I’m trying to make them feel angry, the way I feel angry. ” Then, bus, bus, bus, bus, bus, bus. And now I’m in Springfield. Taking local buses to get back to my mom’s place in Chicopee. I didn’t have any sort of chance to leave the bus from New York to here, so I was fiending for a cigarette and very hungry. And then the bus went by Six Flags before going to Springfield. And the driver couldn’t drive. Then again, I was so pissy, I’m sure that’s the only reason I noticed how he drove at all. Getting into New York was an adventure, too. The bus was stalling out from just before we were in city limits. Ha. So then we kept stalling and starting again, in the Lincoln Tunnel, as we blocked traffic and were honked at. Let’s go, bus. I want to shower. 33 After I had been in Alix’s presence for longer than twenty-four hours, we had run the gamut. All well between us, yes, having chatted and slept, and in the morning kept the company of Blonde Amy, and then the venture into town once Amy had gone to get a nipple pierced, meeting at the Woodstar Café. And there was sun and my cell phone was ringing. I parted ways with Alix. The walk through town, making me slightly nervous, my spider-sense more sensitive in the downtown nowadays, and the people I think I hear mumbling how hot I must be with this head of hair. Nancy was in Alix’s apartment when I returned. She was helping herself to Alix’s Internet, which was okay, of course, both she and Dark-haired Jill had earned Alix’s trust when it came to letting themselves in. Nancy explained some of her role playing characters, scrolling through profiles at a web site. I asked if she wanted anything from Burger King, so she came along for the ride, and then we went back to Alix’s, sipped our fountain drinks, and then she was off. I read some Stephen King until Alix returned. She was feeling stressed out. I asked what I could do. She was uncharacteristically direct in asking if we could go somewhere to eat, so we did. Some girl was sitting across from us, still wrinkling her face at the sight of Alix, because they went to high school together. 34 July 28, 2004. Alix and I have been spending unprecedented amounts of time together, although before this we were already in each other’s arms nearly every night. It’s tempting to forget there was much else before. Alix has become quite the songwriter, well beyond the place where she was only months ago, and recording now. Every now and then she begins to tell her tale from a new perspective. My picture of her history is a composite, all these stories overlain upon each other. She’s told Henry that they will never be together again—she has said the words—but it’s not settling him yet. She goes to Pizza Factory to work, manages her lengthy shift, and returns covered in flour to her home, where other people frequently already are. I applied through lengthy procedures to what seemed like a billion colleges across the country. None accepted me. And now, what’s left? Except for UMass Boston… or to stay here and go to UMass Amherst. Tried to plot out finances with a calculator and couldn’t, couldn’t. What do I know of such sums? You can’t go running away going, “Nyah nyah, I’m leaving”, you can’t run away in complete assuredness. You can only leave in love. Only love will let you leave without a fight. And then you can never go home again. Why is it like that? But it is. 35 I’ve actually mentioned it to Alix for the first time—what if I stayed? After all, I said, I did everything I wanted, did everything in that one year plan. But the ending… I just planned to stick myself in an unfamiliar city at college. To see where I would go from there. I tried to intentionally sabotage myself in advance by not making “stay local” an option. I don’t know what day it is. I’ve lost track, printing up the archives of my writing into binders. Hours of this, just so I can store them away, leave it be, leave it be. And the ring of my cell phone (how to pay for it now?) and the sound of Alix’s voice. And then us talking, talking, and we haven’t even started, just breaking the surface, like we could never run out of things to talk about, it feels. And I’ve been reading, reading, and watching my depleting bank account. "

    "body": "36 Aug. 11. Well, I’m staying in the area. I don’t know where I’m going to live, but I’ll take courses through the Department of Continuing Education at UMass Amherst come the beginning of next month. Many, many details of the past several months have not been written about. Going over what has been chronicled about things with Alix, I do sort of wish that the record showed how simple it’s been… how calm. 37 Sep. 6, 2004. A pleasant morning. The weather has cooled, and the air is crisp outside. Jonny, I’m told, called numerous times throughout the day. Eventually the phone was handed to me, while I was in bed. I’m pretty sure that I made plans to meet with him at 7 PM, but he didn’t arrive. I waited until 8:15 before I ventured out on my own. Alix and I are taking a break from each other. This had started to seem inevitable after some time of my trying to get things back to normal between us, unsuccessfully. I told her to be straight with me if this were actually a real end to us, but “taking a break” was what resulted from the conversations, and that’s about the best I was hoping for by then. She doesn’t feel like she has the energy for a serious relationship, and she wants to see other people. I drove, drove, which was nice again. Into Amherst. Now I’m at Rao’s. Maurice is working. And Nim, here to play go, has initiated a conversation with me about baby-eating lambs. Hm. But now that talk has finished. 38 There’s always someone mopping a floor, saying, “If I were smarter, I’d be a businessman”. But if you took the mop out of his hand and gave him a scholarship, he’d still be mopping a floor in his mind. As a child, I believed that trying to the best of one’s ability ensured that one ended up in the right place. That floor-moppers were floor-mopping types. That businessmen were businessman-types. And that it was all okay, there was just something called “finding oneself”. A person only “found oneself”. Maybe as a floor-mopper, maybe as a businessman. It was a nice dream… 39 My instructor for Creative Writing is a grad student who sits in a chair at the front of her class with her legs wrapped around each other like a vine. She steps outside with some of us to smoke Camel Lights during the break in class. 40 My mind distracts itself as I try to read. Not surprising: I’ve been doing a lot studying, and my dreams at night reflect the fact of this. Pleasant, pleasant, but maybe I need a phone call. 41 Ha! While writing this, I get better than a phone call—friends walking by me and some text messages on my phone. Color me satisfied. 42 If fossils burn and there’s no one left to use them, there will still be the irony that we’ve traded new skeletons for old ones. 43 We’ve kept the books, but burned the eyes that would read them. 44 Nearly panicked last night, looking over what I needed to do for classes, fearing now the AWFUL! (suddenly) notion of not succeeding with this schooling. So into work I went, directly from Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama class, and I was asked if I would mind being ‘on call’ or otherwise coming in a few hours later than originally scheduled. Sure, I said, and added that I wanted to be taken off the schedule entirely as soon as was convenient. But I was talked into still closing Sunday nights, and, next week at least, I’ll be closing Friday as well. Then I closed last night, and this morning, slept through my alarm and then for another four hours! My body, it seemed, having not gotten a good night’s sleep in recent memory, was vetoing my decision to go to class. So, this morning was when I really did panic. But, since then I’ve studied up on Latin and, to a lesser degree, French, so it’s not so so bad. Also harmful is that it’s not just work. Tuesday I went to Haven. Wednesday, to the They Might Be Giants concert with Julian and his girlfriend Ellie. So, then, I’m ‘screwing up’! Oh, whatever. Some helpful reassurance could be used, so tonight I’m free and tonight I’m meeting Katie from Ware. 45 Where did I leave off? I don’t remember. They teach me at university. The ends of my hair keep faded bits of color and bleach. I wear my eyeglasses. Mostly I’m lonesome, but I ride public transit and listen to the kids who rap at the bus stop. (I’m pretending to be absorbed in Calvino or Marlowe but close examination would show that I’m gazing, not reading. ) I buy a slice of pizza and juice, send text messages about what-are-you-doing-tonight while translating Latin. I pretend that I know the French language better than I do, and I get by like this. I’m sitting under a tree and somebody comes by and gives me a hug. They’re busy and I’m busy, the whole world’s busy, but a few moments of touch are enough. The workshopping suggests that my characters, though on the whole fresh and complex, have odd moments when they suddenly seem like caricatures. But I have those moments too. I knocked at the doors of the Academy until they weren’t expecting me to climb through the window. I see everyone in their pajamas as a momentary snapshot, then they hand me a twenty and I hand them their barbeque wings, and I’m moving on again. When business gets slow, my fellow employees can talk about fiscal policy and I can ask for advice about what’s wrong with my computer that day. The night is long but passes quickly. Then time itself is moving quickly, but I’m not sleeping. And when I do sleep I’m meeting all the people I don’t have the time to meet, all the people I don’t have time to remember at all. And then I’m dazed, and I shave myself cleanly, and I think that maybe I miss Hell from the place of this Purgatory, but mostly I’m not sure. I disappeared from my own lives and they continued without me. I watch from the corner, sometimes, and I wave, but I know it’s only a land that someone else will claim in time, subject to inheritance and repossession and condemnation like any other estate. I dance in empty streets without anyone to watch, and so little is important that really, anything could be. 46 Having gotten drunk with a couple of co-workers after the store’s closing last night (2:30 AM) my manager, who opened this morning, appeared to be unconscious at the office desk when I arrived this afternoon. She doesn’t make pizzas well enough to keep up with the dinner rush even on a good night, so the fact that she was frequently running to the restroom to vomit made wait times for a delivery longer than one hour. And guess who then had to show up at these customers’ doorsteps with their overdue, poorly-made supper? Yup. Yours truly. But the night was slow, and I was working ‘til close, and at one point, everything was done except to wait for the clock to strike midnight. And I sat on the trunk of my car and I got to thinking about sitting on the trunks of cars. And sitting on the hoods of cars, for that matter. And the people with whom I’ve sat on hoods and trunks of cars. And thinking about “who I am”—that, too, and I thought, “I’m going to do this forever”. This being, finding stillness. This being the places one can go while sitting on the trunks of cars. 47 I walk the campus just to drink from as many water faucets as I can. And the passersby pass by. I have more to read. “I need to talk with you,” Alix said, but I don’t really want to go, do I? Don’t want to hear what she might say. Ooo! That girl had a yo-yo! She should have come over here to show me tricks. I’d have said, “It’s okay, I’ve done most of my homework. Show me all that you know about the ways of the yo-yo. Don’t worry, I will devote myself honorably to this task; I love to devote myself to ridiculous things. ” But she only paused to look at the sign which has a sign pointing to it which reads “LOOK” and then points to the other sign. I keep checking my cell phone, like I want to make other plans. Meanwhile, the world is coming alive around me, and I’m lost within it. One of these days somebody’s going to offer their hand, to pull me in, and I won’t be able to resist, and I’ll come alive, and I won’t worry so much as I do now, here, celebrating then collapsing alone at the outskirts of my heart. 48 Helena messaged to see how I’ve been doing. She said that she and her friend had decided they were living in an alternate 2004. I asked if that meant I was in an alternate 2004 also. That depended on how I felt, she said. 49 Today I awoke around 4 AM, drove through the rain to the 7-11 to get cigarettes, organized some of my recent scribblings into the beginnings of a new archive, responded via email to a story one of my Creative Writing classmates wrote, went to UMass, walked through that pouring rain to class, went to Latin, found out that I’d scored an 80 on my Latin exam, which, okay, I can live with, though the professor is saying, “No one should have scored below an 88. This is by far the easiest test you’ll have. If you got below an 88, you should get to work to turn things around for yourself. ” I stood in the ground level space between Herter Hall and Herter Annex, and June came by. As usual, she was a bright contribution to the day, but today actually looked happy and not overwhelmed for a change. Then French class, where I understood everything that was going on but was too shy to answer when called upon in class. By the time I was out, the rain had let up and I went to Northampton. I ate a slice of pizza from Pinocchio’s. I sat in the Haymarket and studied French. I called Salma. She was working, but wanted to chat. The place where she works will be closing soon. How worrisome for her. We talked about this and that, said we should hang out this weekend. Then she had to get back to work. I walked through Uncle Margaret’s and Faces without finding any clothes to buy. My next stop was Gypsy Heart, and to my surprise, while I was in there who entered but Katie from Ware, and her friend, whose name I never remember, whom I’m never sure I recognize until she addresses me. “Stay in touch!” I made a point of saying to Katie. I found a shirt to buy, then went back to Chicopee. I went online for a bit and had the exchange with Helena. I found some guides to help me with some of the basic French skills I’ve forgotten. I called Alyson, who has moved to Hartford and is unemployed and has no car anymore. We rode around in my car. She had no problem with our lack of direction. We walked in downtown Hartford for a bit, then drove yet some more. The East Windsor Grill is no longer 24 hours, it turns out, so we went to Denny’s and played Rummy. We tied the first round. I lost the second round by far. Then, on the way home, we talked politics. The Kerry/Bush debate is tomorrow. 50 I was awoken by the phone just in time. In fact, it was my mom calling, to make sure that I was awake. I barely had time left to wake up and get to class. We were out of milk. I ran downstairs. Memé and Aunt Deb were down there. Who else? My cousin Kyle, I want to say. Maybe my cousin Katie, too. My hair was all still a mess, and my eyes half open. I asked for milk for my coffee. It was pretty funny. After that, I just remember drinking coffee and immediately hurrying to study Latin vocabulary before I left. I spent the last of the change I had on a parking meter in the visitor’s lot (because I didn’t have the time to park at the mall then ride the bus). On the way out from class, that guy who sits across from me asked me for a cigarette and then told me he loved me when I gave him one. Also, he gave me fifty cents, and insisted that I keep it, “‘Cause you never know. ” I drove my car to the mall and did homework at the little coffee shop inside (also skimming the New York Times. ) I took the bus back to campus and read more from the book for French Grammar. (When I’ve had the chance, I’ve been reading through it comprehensively instead of just bouncing around in the text and doing the assigned lessons. I need to do this to refresh my memory. Maybe I’ll be able to dig up my old textbook from the Elementary and Intermediate classes I had at HCC. Maybe it will still smell like Brielle and the Amherst Common. ) I was balancing myself precariously on damp soil while reading about verb formation, stopping to shoo bugs or poke at leaves. I watched all the nameless faces as they walked the campus and tried to make myself feel certain ways. I ran into Salma as she was on her way to class… hugged her, kept hugging her, and she let me not let go, and she said that was the best hug she had had in a while and I said that that’s what gets me through the days now, is drive-by hugs. But she wasn’t walking away just yet, so we talked for a few minutes, and would I be around when she got out from her class? (I have class in Bartlett Hall just after she gets out of a class in the same building. She’s taking classes, hoping and planning to re-enroll at Smith at some point to finish that degree she started. ) Alone again, I pulled my discman out from my bag. I have to keep my finger propping the cover open to a certain degree so that the disc will read, and I have to keep it there the whole time I’m listening to a disc, and it leaves little marks on the ends of my fingertips. Neutral Milk Hotel’s In the Aeroplane over the Sea was the disc that I had. I walked around without direction, bag over shoulder, listening to it. Stopped and studied some more French after I had gone the path around the duck pond and said hello to a swan. I met with Salma again for another ten-fifteen minute’s talk. Maybe we can still hang out Saturday, but maybe not, Johnny might be coming to visit her. We made up stories about leaves and she gave me a clove cigarette. I keep almost falling asleep during Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama, and this never happened to me before… because, like, this is even when I’m not tired. I’m not disinterested; he just talks so slowly, I guess my mind figures (correctly) that it can sleep between the pauses in his speech and still catch everything said. But even weirder is that it’s not just dozing, it’s my eyes coming unfocused, it’s me going cross-eyed, like I’m on some crazy drug. And little bits of dreams, where my mind thinks it’s understanding some analysis of a play’s text, but then I blink and I’m awake again and I think, “But… that was Latin vocabulary I had floating through my thoughts. That’s not even the right class!” but it had seemed to make sense, for a moment. I came home, filled out the application for admission as a real university student (since I’m enrolled through the Continuing Education department, currently). I did the application three times, actually, there at the web site, because the application would say that I forgot to add my zip code or that I entered a year in two digit rather than four digit format, and then I’d have to do it all over again, letting out a bellow of anguish, and oh well, I could remember the basic point of what I had written in those short essays… In the evening I watched the presidential debate. Now I want to sleep A. S. A. P. , because tomorrow is going to be madness of the sort that I probably won’t want to write about, since that would be whining. 51 Haymarket Café, Northampton, Massachusetts. And there is music playing. And yesterday was class, then… what? Study. And things like that. Then work. And all that. Got home at four in the morning… so I slept in. This is my day off. I just finished Latin homework. It’s Saturday night. Rainy. Beautiful. I am rainy and beautiful. Left my glasses in the car, by choice, because it’s just that sort of mood, and let’s see. Let’s see. let’s hear. I talked to Salma on the phone last night. Her boy was on her way to the area. She talked about feelings and relationships. On my cell phone I was, having time before I was due to deliver pizzas, standing in the parking lot of the 7-11 in Easthampton. 52 Then I went to Javanet and studied French. And Alix entered. And there we were, just happening upon each other. I was drinking tea. She got a coffee. I closed my French book, and we made pleasant conversation. I think I was looking good. We walked around Northampton. We bought her cigarettes, and we talked. I didn’t really want to talk about “us”, but we did anyway, and this was probably my fault. She said, “I really just wanted to be friends with you, but then I got caught on this path of becoming your worst fucking fears. ” “Well,” I said, “As someone who has on many occasions been confronted by his worst fucking fears, I’ve got to say it’s a good sign if that’s what you were, because you weren’t that bad. (Pause. ) Aren’t that bad. ” I hoped that she would argue with this and tell me more about how bad she was. She didn’t. She came across people she knew. These folks were going to the Elevens (formerly Harry’s). Alix invited me to go with them. I accepted the invitation. I wanted to be so okay, so cool and unphased in Alix’s presence, that it would trip her up and she would begin to look genuine to me again. At first, I said things confidently, and made her friends laugh. Then, I was just staring into space. I was texting Julian. I was planning to meet him, to go to the Whately Diner, to spill my insides to him. Alix was on the dance floor. In the car I didn’t know whether to hug Alix goodbye or not, but she hugged me, and she didn’t stop. She invited me up, though it was obvious I was prepared to leave. We had sex. Before we went to sleep, she said that she’d wanted for me to take her back from the bar and to stay over because of the scary dreams she had had during her afternoon nap. In the morning I came home and my mom saw that I wasn’t happy. I shut myself in my (my stepsister Alyssa’s) room and read the newspaper. 53 The Hampshire Mall, Hadley, Massachusetts. Where’s my cell phone? I can’t find my cell phone. I call Alix’s house from a pay phone. Maybe she has my cell phone. There’s no answer. Maybe I’ll drive over there. Northampton, Massachusetts. The five bicycles of the downstairs neighbors lie against the front of the housing complex. What’s with those neighbors and Alix having had a falling out? No, Alix’s not here, but the door’s unlocked. I feel strangely wrong about being in here. I’m expecting to be caught in the middle of something. Maybe I really want to come up with something that I would be afraid to get caught doing. Maybe that desire is what scares me. (When she and I were together, part of me always wanted to catch her in the middle of some evil conspiracy, some lie, some affair that she would otherwise have claimed never happened. But it wasn’t that I wanted an excuse to feel hurt. No, I wanted to redefine her evils until they weren’t evil anymore. I wanted to turn her skeletons into roses. And the more, the better. ) I call her at work from her own phone. I don’t tell her that I’m calling from her phone. She says that she hasn’t seen my cell phone. I guess my work here is done. DB Mart. I used to work here. It’s the dirtiest convenience store in town. I call my mom from the pay phone. She’s not able to find my cell phone. She calls my cell phone. I listen for the sound of a ringtone in my car. I hear it. It was under the passenger’s seat. "

    "body": "54 A walk seems like a good idea. I have a bit of spring in my step. I feel okay. “Levi!” I hear. Someone in a car that’s stopped is waving to me. She’s just let out a passenger. I say “Hey there!” even though I don’t recognize the person yet. Ah, it’s Britta. I haven’t seen her for a while. She points at me, then points to the passenger’s seat. I hop in and we ride. I help her to carry some of the latest carful of her possessions she has brought up from New Jersey. In exchange for my help she gives me cookies and iced tea. She remarks that the martini glasses her mother bought as a gift are labeled as “essentials”. She invites me to a gathering that her friend is having. Dress is “formal to extravagant”, she says. I have plans to visit Sarah X. on the same night, though, so I decline the offer. I put Neutral Milk Hotel on her turntable. It’s their first record, and I haven’t heard it. I don’t hear much of it before we go. She drops me off at my car, gives me her number, and leaves me to the oil change I’ve scheduled. I’m tired and ill-prepared for my Creative Writing class. After it’s finished I miss the bus, wait 45 minutes for the next one, then drive home. I’ve convinced myself that I might be going mad. I call Alix. Julian calls while I’m talking to Alix, so I put Alix on hold. When I switch back to talk to Alix again, Dark-haired Jill, who has been staying over there a lot, is trying to call her boyfriend.  (“BEEP BEEP”, I hear as she dials. ) It’s better that I should talk to Julian, anyway. I ask him if he ever thinks he’s going mad. As I’ve also said of/to Salma recently, I’m glad that Julian has emotions: it allows me to feel that I’m not the only one. I chat online with V. about how to spread goodness into the world. 55 My mother is in the hospital… for dehydration? No one wants to talk about it. I hate that, even though I know she’ll be fine. 56 When I become hopeful again is when I finish speaking about my hopelessness, online, to Julian. One day has become all days, with no beginning or ending. I’m not even talking about my mother, anymore. I’m talking about that terrible sense of meaninglessness that springs upon a person when the past is revised and thereby it’s hard to know oneself anymore. But then I shower and I’m thinking about “squishiness”. Squishiness! That desperate emotion—I want to call it an emotion—which in a bizarre and counterintuitive way is actually a lot like anger, only instead of being randomly destructive it’s randomly constructive. It’s still dangerous, sure, but that’s what emotions are for. Back at the campus, everyone seems solemn. June wheels her bike, seeking something to which it can be tied. She waves weakly, says that she’s dealing with a lot this week. She gives me a hug after, but it’s a sad hug and is nowhere near enough for her, for me, for this world. No squishiness there. She pulls away with what I’m sure is unintended sharpness when she’s off for class. Salma gives me a drive-by hug, too. She’s late for Women in Theater class. I missed my Latin class this morning. I have things to do sometime-when-I-get-the-chance, but not today. I’m hungry. I want good grades and a healthy demeanor. I want sleep. I should feed myself. I don’t think I’ll be able to visit Sarah X. after all. A stranger lets me use her lighter. 57 Sitting with Salma on campus, I hand her leaves. This is another new quirk of mine—I hand people leaves. She’s breaking them apart as I hand them to her. We’re sitting on that stone wall thing, under that tree, outside of Bartlett. We waste no time in having deep conversation. When does deep conversation stop being an event and start becoming an addiction? But no, this really does feel good, feels good like coming home after a day of work. This and talking and being prompted to talk, and do I, boy do I need to name people by name and explain where I’m coming from. The truth only seems honest once you can tell it to someone. Usually we’ve talked about her, and we do today, yes, but I can tell by the way I don’t make eye contact and stop smiling that I’m communicating again. “When the past gets revised, and I’m supposed to agree to this, but I’m agreeing to this with people I’m not intimate with anymore, so there’s no security in it, and it’s like, what am I supposed to do when suddenly I’m not supposed to think of the past for the way it felt at the time anymore?” and “I haven’t intentionally skipped class in years. ” and “Yeah. Let’s go get food. ” 58 Visiting the hospital is unfamiliar to me. Bruce parks his truck on a curb, because the lot is full. On our way to find my mother, we pass through an art gallery of sorts. My aunt Kim and uncle Phil arrive soon after we do. On the ride home, Bruce asks for one of my cigarettes. 59 The morning wasn’t very exciting. I didn’t do very well on my French exam. I remember to buy that floppy disk I need. Julian has invited me to see Shaun of the Dead with him and his friend Morte. Hampshire Mall. Julian is playing Dance Dance Revolution with a stranger. He’s gotten photos developed—mostly of me, some of him. We eat Chinese food and sit by the statues of naked babies, which were parts of an active water fountain back in the 1980s. The movie is better than I expected. They leave, then I leave. Helena calls me, and I’m on the second floor porch, pacing, while she is in Somerville and waiting for a bus. “You’re funny! I forgot that,” she tells me when I make her laugh. 60 Rocky Horror. After 3 hours of work. My mom has returned from the hospital. I don’t think Ellie (Julian’s girlfriend) talks to me at all while I’m at the theater. I’m not wearing my eyeglasses. I always go to these things with people who know all the responses to shout at the screen. I don’t have anything to shout out, but I dance the Time Warp. I’m surprised by how few people I know here. I finished my Latin homework already, and printed out and commented on my Creative Writing classmates’ poetry and prose. Alix called while I was asleep. She just sold a bunch of her clothes at a tag sale, and maybe I want some of the leftovers? My aunt Cheryl’s boyfriend is loud and charming, which I can’t handle if I’m groggy, just waking up. 61 Inside Britta’s car. Curtiss didn’t feel like coming. I pick out Alanis Morissette as driving music, which Britta says surprises her because I’m a boy. The person she knows who is reading poetry at this Flywheel event, yes, I’ve seen him before. I saw him at an open mic event at a house in Hadley. Which Alix took me to, though I was scared to be in public, at the time. Scared of everything, everyone. He remembers me too. It’s intimidating how many people remember me. Anyway, this guy is one of the warmup acts for Michelle Tea. Julian has texted me nice things, and he’s getting out of work, so we pick him up. Britta’s driveway, we all give hugs. Julian and I go to the Whately. Robyn is working. I’ve talked with her a couple times recently, around campus. She seems well. She’s still with the same boy, since just after the last time she had me over (in 2002). She brings us our burgers, which arre drippy and sog the buns. Before Julian exits my car he scritches my head for a long while. 62 Latin class went well enough in the morning. There’s some extra time I left on the parking meter, so why not explore the library? I must not have been looking up; I didn’t realize that the school’s library is twenty-six stories high. I step from the elevator to a random floor, and there’s no one else in these aisles. Books, books, books. A woman who seems scatterbrained on the “art floor”, helping me to use the computer system that indexes this all. I track down a French-language copy of Camus’ L’étranger and figure out, then, how to borrow it. So tired when I get out from Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama. I drive home, then nap, then do homework. I’m realizing that I’m sick with a cold or something. 63 I’m on my way to get a slice of pizza at the Blue Wall, Campus Center. Beep beep! There’s a text message from Julian: “I gotta say this. In a totally platonic way, I love you. ” I read it. But don’t respond quite yet. I only smile, looking at my choices for pizza toppings. “Right back atcha,” I eventually respond, “You soothe me. ” A number of people aren’t in Creative Writing class. Those of us who are there digress a bit in conversation, and the women are saying, “It’s possible to be attracted to someone of your own gender… (“without being GAY” goes unsaid) and it can be a different sort of attraction, like wanting to be a person. ” That’s different? Why would that distinction matter? I’m weak and tired. 64 I catch only the end of the third presidential debate. I should sleep, but don’t feel like I can. I also should do Latin homework. I feel able to do little more than to lie still and to write in this journal. Last night, I thought to myself that it feels like there’s less magic in the world as I know it since 9/11/01. Society used to feel more loose and improvisational, at least here in America, as recently as the summer of 2001. I know I shouldn’t think too much about these things so much, let alone write about them. I feel like all this writing I’ve been doing these past few years has helped me practice doing it safely, though. 65 So dazed as I’m walking into Latin class. But I like it here, like the professor’s sense of humor, so I laugh a little self-consciously at her asides, but this morning my hair is wet, I left early but not early enough. I drove forty minutes but still I’m squinting my eyes and blinking before I put my name on the exam. Flipping the pages, doing a translation here and a parsing there, back and forth, then I’ve finished. Exhaling all the way through, it feels like another B, which would have seemed well enough in another time and place but not now, not here. Finally getting into the swing of French Grammar. Good that we’re simply reviewing the finer details of using articles this week. On my own I can focus on everything I need to review because I learned it so long ago or never learned it at all. 66 After I nap—oh, sweet bliss!—I feel vaguely awake. Julian asks what I’m up to (via text) and this is great, we’ll hang out, and because of this I will have enough motivation to de-caveman-ify myself. I’m running a few minutes late, so we’ve arranged to rendezvous at Haymarket. He immediately scritches my head and my face dips to the tabletop, squished against its hard surface, and it hurts a little bit at this position, but, good, I’m being scritched. Then he gives me a back massage, just forceful enough. “That was… transformative,” I say, then we bounce to my car, to the Route 9 Diner (formerly The Sit-Down Diner, how long ago was that?) and he reads a bit from my old journals, circa the year 2000, and we eat, then drive around asking each other questions. In the parking lot of his apartment complex in Sunderland, we’re parked and hugging as though for goodbye, but it doesn’t turn out that way. Randomly, I ask him to sing me a Billy Joel song. He picks a really nice one (“Lullaby”?) that I haven’t heard before. When prompted to sing for him I start, then give up; maybe it’s just that I feel so much more like being sung to than I feel like singing. Maybe it’s because my nose is stuffy. I don’t know. He insists on putting one of my CDs (The Map You’ve Got) in my CD player. He sings along to some of it. He likes my music. Then he has me listen to Phish, because I haven’t really listened to them before. I lean my head against his puffy jacket. 67 I wake up to a call nearly begging for me to to work until close tonight. I agree to. When I then go online, Britta tells me that Curtiss is throwing a party and asked for her to invite me. I tell her that she’s just ten minutes too late in letting me know. Alix IMs and says that we should hang out sometime. Last night, I managed to get my mother’s computer online for just long enough to download some recording software. As for the necessary hardware and wires, I have everything I need except for my one power adapter. How annoying—it’s just that one missing component that’s keeping me from recording again. 68 It’s as if my body has noticed that on some nights I’ll be working until 3:00, and that most mornings I’ll be waking at 7:00, so to avoid confusion it’s set itself on a schedule of only sleeping between the hours of 4:00 and 7:00, no matter how tired I get. Today I went over to Britta’s apartment, ate Little Debbie snack cakes and drank water. Some of Lydia’s things were there; depressed and bearded, she visited and brought them, according to Britta. There were records that I recognized. Some clothes. C’mon, Lydia, be okay. Britta and I danced without music, and hugged, because, she said, there needed to be more hugs in the world. This was like something I would have said. I dropped her off at Smith, then parked and walked by CVS, spying Julian through the window. I was strangely too timid to go in and disturb him at work, even though he had invited me to. Creative Writing class, particularly the instructor, I thought, liked my poems. I begin to think, Oh, shit. I could maybe, like, be a poet. After thoughts like that, I have to hide somewhere… hide somewhere far, far away… because I don’t want to be anything. It’s three in the morning now. I still can’t sleep, so I’m drinking beer. There’s stuff I want to let out. How it’s raining. How I don’t want to miss this autumn. How I’m satisfied, don’t want to rock my own boat. How I should stop coughing, take care of myself. How I’ve brushed away the guilt. How there’s nothing, nothing wrong, yet nothing, nothing right. How I’m at a loss for words, yet so eloquent as I plug up my heart. 69 I use my cell phone to find Alix online, say that I’m coming over to get my coat. I do. She’s drunk by herself, chatting online and speaking mean remarks to the computer screen. She says that she’s not going to Haven, then she says she’s going to Haven. Keeps changing her mind. 70 In the morning Julian texts me, comes right out and says that he would like to kiss me. You see, he’s talked to Ellie about his “kiss drive” and she’d surprised him by saying she didn’t mind if he kissed people so long as it wasn’t going to compromise their relationship? Which is all well and good, just, let’s not get too excited now, y’know? There are plenty of people out there I could kiss, but not so many people who are a good influence on me. Let’s tiptoe. 71 I’m at Denny’s reading The Malcontent when the Red Sox beat the Yankees in the play-offs. The people in the dorms at my college are probably rioting right now. 72 Thursday, I miss Latin class. I see Salma on the way to Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama. We haven’t really been able to talk during our usual 15-minute time slots the past week or two, so we do this time. I’m underwhelmed by the class discussion on The Malcontent. Then I do homework at Haymarket until 9, when Julian gets out from work. We see Napolean Dynamite, which is okay. I drive him back, and again in my car in the parking lot of his apartment complex we sit. This time, we eventually kiss. He mouths my ear. I moan. When I get back home, I do still more homework—after all, I’m to take a Latin quiz in the morning. My mom looks concerned that I’m still awake, still studying. I wake up. I think I ace the quiz. I turn in that overdue French assignment. I go home, check my email, chat online a little bit. Go to Easthampton to do homework. Read and write notes on the works of my Creative Writing classmates. Start a response paper for that Michelle Tea reading I went to. Somehow, though, I’m feeling distracted there at Cottage St. Café, and go to Northampton.  Sit in Haymarket. Nim talks to me. I show him random pages from my notebook, where I’ve been scribbling down definitions of Latin vocabulary. I start the assigned imitation of David Foster Wallace, for Creative Writing. I get some done, then, having finished my tea, I walk toward my car. In the crosswalk, Nellie runs and flings herself onto me, arms around my shoulders, feet around my legs. I’m like, hey. Haven’t seen you in a while. Then I’m standing on the streets of Northampton. She’s showing me that she has her artwork on her cell phone: “See? That’s the all-seeing eye, between chaos and order. ” Then there’s Charlie. We kiss each other on the cheek. He says I should go to karaoke at the WWII tonight. I say maybe sometime, but probably not tonight, no. But I love you, I love you. The sky is getting dark. I’m tired, but thinking about staying awake. I wrote on the schedule that I can’t work next weekend. Hey. It’s the weekend now. I’m so tired, but I’m right here, right now. I’m in Northampton. Just a shard of the old times, back for me to look at for an instant. "

    "body": "73 I rode along with Britta and Becca to the Dresden Dolls’ Halloween show in Boston. Although I was exhausted as a result of my always messed up sleep schedule, I had a great time. The show opened with the two band members (singer Amanda Palmer and drummer Brian Viglione) dressed as Sonny and Cher, playing “I Got You Babe”. The two then performed a strip tease slash costume change as they each changed into Britney Spears costumes. They played “Baby One More Time”, then did another on-stage costume change into their usual white face makeup and Dresden Dolls garb. It felt like the most rock and roll thing I had seen in years. Becca, a regular at this band’s shows, wanted to wait around and chat with Amanda Palmer for a bit. I was really tired, though, so Britta and I went and waited in the car until Becca returned. (On the way home, I half woke up as Becca pointed out Amanda’s place on Massachusetts Avenue. ) 74 I woke up in the evening sometime. Paid for coffee and french fries at Denny’s. I studied there. Night came and went. This morning, I considered napping. I couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t make the alarm set. The morning after George W. Bush had been elected to his second term, the radio alarm had voiced a program of bible study.  This morning, there was more bible study. Revelations and prophesy. We are all afraid. That was why Helena called me a night or two before the election. She was feeling scared by the notion of four more years. I watched the television at Salma’s place. Julian came over, too, and when the first network called Bush the projected winner of Ohio and therefore of the election, he sobbed. The radio voice spoke over a strange and harsh buzz about the Antichrist and the Roman Empire. Rome never fell, a voice says. How did the Greek gods feel? The leaves have fallen. The meteorologist predicted rain for tonight. That’s not prophesy; it’s science. Some days I have only myself to hug. I look at myself in the mirror. 75 As much as I thought that I would be majoring in Comparative Literature, I think now that I’m going to go for English instead. Probably best in the long run. 76 My grounding has been Julian. We text each other as we prepare to leave our respective homes in the morning, then text each other sporadically through the day, and maybe talk each other to sleep. Sometimes we even meet up and kiss, which I usually like. My drive for intimacy finds some fulfillment. I have a friend, and yet I’m not in that uncertain territory of ‘relationships’. I’ve been to some parties, which have been pleasant. I see Charlie occasionally. I didn’t see Salma at all last week. I missed her. No more work. Somehow it all comes down to what it’s like when I run into June on a Monday or Wednesday between Herter Hall and Herter Annex. That’s life: a bold hello, a sympathetic character, a spark from the static of my sweater. Everything I feel gets fused down into a certain number of words. The rest of it explodes in an atomic blast that’s called life. We part ways, I move on, and my thoughts travel elsewhere. 77 Bits of homework scattered throughout Thanksgiving break. Like, reading The Duchess of Malfi for the first time today. OMFG. 78 It feels like my life’s been a big long game of the original Legend of Zelda without a strategy guide. A person learns a lot when they’re lost in the forest. Mostly after it starts to rain. And they have to find a place to sleep. And they still wake up in the morning. There’s no reason to keep going, but for some strange reason you decide to keep going. And then you realize that there are limitless reasons to keep going. 79 Dec. 13, 2004. Weather gets cold again. I need to write a little assignment in French tonight. Then tomorrow, between classes, a little response (in English) to a poetry reading. Then it’s just a break, before finals. But there’s something else I need to do, and it’s just as important. I need to go for a walk—however cold that might be. I’ll walk to the store and buy a beverage or something. Then, I will have walked. 80 There’s a hill. Some trees. I stop and look. Crossing railroad tracks. It’s no good to panic when I think of water; there is nothing to be afraid of. We keep singing the same old songs wherever we go. And we do it in disguise. I am a metaphor that I am intimidated to write. You will call me impression without profit; I will call you profit without impression. 81 Starting words. Quick, arbitrary grounding. I’ve been going on for years. Haymarket Café, Northampton, Massachusetts. Yesterday was the last day of classes for this semester, excepting finals (which are next Monday and Tuesday). I did pretty well. I will probably be living in dorms next semester for the first time in my life, at the age of twenty-three. I’m less wrapped up in Northampton now, or so it feels. Certainly, at another place in my life, I’d be planning to go to Haven tonight, referring to it elegantly as a “goth function”. Maybe I’ll cut my hair again. It’s getting long. I notice this, because I’m sitting across from a mirror. I think I’m bored tonight. Hopefully I’ll finish revising my portfolio for Creative Writing tonight. Maybe I’ll go home and do that (or something else) now.  I’m really only here to get my fix of being-around-people-ness. 82 Cape Cod with Julian this weekend. There was walking and sitting along marshes. Book shopping in Provincetown. Teenagers in the mall. Movie watching and pancakes. Lying awake in darkness, in an old house. Bowling. Hugging people I’ve never met. And we’re almost to the end of another year. And before the trip, he told me that he wanted to have sex with me. I don’t want to have sex with him. 83 The night before I left I rented Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind because the box said the girl’s name was Clementine. And, you see, there was an empty box of clementines my mom had taken out, because she had stored the Christmas tree decorations in it. And when I bought Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael and Madeleine L’Engle’s The Arm of the Starfish, it was because Ishmael reminded me of a certain type of person, which reminded me of the couple days I spent in Astoria, Oregon, and that town reminded me of Cape Cod, where I was. At the register, the bookstore owner gave me a clementine. The weekend was like that, reminding me of that vision quest, which reminded me of playing guitar for the trees, then exiting from isolation, and having that guy play “In the Aeroplane over the Sea” on my guitar. So I listened to Neutral Milk Hotel on the ride home and bought the Cat Power DVD that is just her playing on a guitar in the forest. So, now, I’ve spent a lot of money, but at least I’m surfing memories, which is a fun thing to do. 84 Wrote then walked in the snow, where I had proof that no one else was walking the streets (seeing my footprints). Streets that are easy to own for a night. 85 Julian’s sleeping. I can’t sleep, of course. And writing, it’s that thing I did. Writing is the thing I did on Liv’s porch, as the leaves fell, and I did it in Boston with ducks. And when I had left Julian to sleep I slipped outside and had a cigarette, there was a constellation, or maybe it wasn’t a constellation, that Julian had pointed to earlier—”Maybe that’s the big dipper… no. ” I can look around finding patterns in everything and call it a life. My New Year’s Eve for 2005 was at Whitehouse’s gaming store. It’s funny how funny it was when that store first opened, and hearing the commercials he made, played on the radio, and I hadn’t been there since the early days. But before that on New Year’s Eve I was with Amelia and walking Northampton. It was good. She wanted pizza and she ate slowly at Nini’s. Then Zella’s mother came in, and Amelia said, “This seems appropriate, somehow. ” Then Amelia figured she would go to a party somewhere, but it was with a certain crowd and I just didn’t feel it was right, she asked if I’d be interested and I was like, “Hm,” but eventually said no. Julian had invited me to the gaming store, in fact he’d said that he would like me there, I was scared, scared because I had drilled into my own head a fear of being unwelcome. I played dutch blitz and a had a dixie cup of champagne at midnight. 86 I had a plan to get myself back onto a conventional sleep schedule. It’s been complicated, though, by Julian’s invitation for us to get a hotel room tonight. 87 Denny’s. I left Julian asleep in the hotel room next door and walked here. I’m going to eat breakfast food, although it’s not breakfast time according to my schedule. Julian had me meet him at Britta’s apartment. That’s a strange connection, Britta hanging out with Julian. Britta made us noodles, yum. Then we went for ice cream at Herrell’s, then to the movies to see Closer, which had its good moments but really seemed to drag on. I forget what happened in it, already. Maybe the fact that I just watched We Don’t Live Here Anymore, which also tried to examine lust, romance, and infidelity among four characters, made me feel so much like I had seen the movie before. Also, I’m annoyed by movies with spunky-cute love interests with strangely dyed hair. That’s why I waited so long to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind—I really feared that it might suck for its inclusion of such a character. These characters seem like composites of everyone I’ve been close to, as interpreted by a certain type of person. And I worry that maybe, in the future, that’s exactly the way I’ll remember the people I used to hang with. Then Britta went home and (finally) Julian and I began our search for a hotel. Best Western was too expensive. We went to the place on King Street around the border between Northampton and Hatfield. Because it was getting late there we had to ring the doorbell, and the guy came from his place in sleeping clothes through the cold. We felt badly about that. Then Julian was asking for me to use a card, saying he’d contribute cash, but I didn’t have enough in my account! So we had dragged the poor guy out of bed for no reason. The two of us sat in the car, then—I was driving my mom’s car—and tried to figure out what to do. Eventually I decided that we could try to find a place around Chicopee. I would grab my checking account number from home, then find a hotel. Inside the hotel I gave Julian a full telling of my life story. We had a bath together. Then his consciousness was ready to give, and we curled up under the covers. I couldn’t sleep, but I thought theoretical thoughts, about… what if dreams are just the same processes we run during the day, our creativity, but with sensory stimulation minimized? Doesn’t that make it weird that a person from the future doesn’t reach back to us when we’re sleeping? Not that I know the science of such stuff. My angels certainly won’t explain anything like that to me. "

    "body": "88 A snowstorm the night before move-in. Never mind that I’m twenty-three years old, that I’ve lived on my own, that I’ve traveled and all that. Never mind that I took a full course load at this college last semester, that it’s only a half hour from my mother’s house. I’m still going away to college, still packing my things up, still nervous, still uncertain about how it’s going to be. It’s still the episode of a sitcom where one of the kids is going away, and you know it’s because they want to pursue a film career but you tear up anyway, you sappy television junkie, you. I make the first trip on my own, in my stepfather Bruce’s sport utility vehicle. I say that it’s because the truck will do better in the snow and that anyway, the car I was driving was almost out of gas, but really, it’s because I already said goodbye to that car, the afternoon before, when the snow was just beginning, with one last dangerous trip to the video store (where I waited behind a dozen other customers preparing for a snow day, just to rent Monty Python’s Life of Brian, as if I had never seen the movie before). I drive slowly and cautiously over the poorly-plowed roads, knowing that the driving conditions will improve once I’m shadowing the bus line between Mount Holyoke and UMass. I enter Hamlin, the house to which I’ve been assigned. I ask the first person I see about where I need to check in. “Go to the Leech”, I think I hear him say, but I don’t want to repeat that in case I heard him wrong, so I simply ask, “Where’s that?” He tells me that it’s the house next door. The house is named “Leach”, it turns out, and there, a nice young woman checks my identification, has me write my student identification number over and over onto various forms, and hands me my room key. Awesome. When I open the door, I’m somewhat surprised, for no reason in particular, by the fact that my roommate’s possessions are very well settled on his side of the room, while he’s wrapped in a blanket in the dark at two in the afternoon. “You must be Levi, twenty-three years old, from Chicopee, Pre-English major. ” I know that his name is Yuwen, but not much more, so this is a slightly unsettling greeting on his part. Then I notice the 57” television set. I had decided not to bring a television set, figuring that fifteen credits of coursework, high-speed Internet access, and thousands of middle class kids between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five would fill my time sufficiently. This was a good choice on my part, it looks like. Yuwen says that he’s used to having this room as a single and that last semester it was a common place for others to visit whenever sporting events were being televised. He segues this rather quickly into an explanation of how he has in the past found better rooms for those who have been assigned to live with him. Already I get the clear impression that he wants me out and that it’s nothing personal against me. Driving back to Chicopee, I get stuck on ice while driving up a hill, and the driver of a car that’s heading in the opposite direction needs to explain to me the mechanics of putting a vehicle into 4-wheel drive. 89 Julian is forced to wait at Campus Center, because it’s taking longer than expected for Bruce and I to get things packed for the next drive to Amherst. Yuwen and his friend are watching a football game on that huge television. Bruce carries multiple boxes of my possessions at a time, with far more speed than I ever could. In the lobby of the dorm house, Julian and I sit. Most of the residents haven’t moved in yet; the school’s official suggestion was that students postpone their move for a day because of the snow. Passersby are few and far between. I have my laptop. He teaches me to play solitaire. We walk to Campus Center, which is open late, and grab some food and drink from the vending machines. 90 Julian leaves, having arranged to get a ride home from June. Yuwen finds more angles from which to try to convince me that I would rather live in a different dorm house. I walk in the cold, listening to Radiohead in headphones, around the campus. Sleep is soothing, although it’s not deep: I’m not used to sleeping in a place that I don’t feel guilty for sleeping in. 91 In the morning I want to shower, but I don’t have shampoo. I go to the University Store, pick up an Ethernet cable while I’m at it. Back in my room, I try to connect to the Internet, but have problems. This disappoints me, because I was planning to find out more about my meal plan options online. I figure that I’ll need to pay cash for my lunch, then, somewhere, wherever. But first, I go to the Textbook Annex, and buy my books, but I notice that the anthology for poet Martín Espada’s workshop course isn’t there. I figure, then, that it’ll be fun to head into town and to search for it (Poetry Like Bread—I’ve seen it in stores before), and to eat out while there. When I return to campus, I walk towards the Whitmore Administration Building. Salma calls. It looks like she’s managed to get back into Smith College, several years after dropping out from there. Our conversation gets cut short because her mom calls on the other line. The Bursar’s office is closed; I hoped to talk to them about meal plans. I ask a few questions at the Financial Aid office. I go to the library and use a computer there to go to the website for OIT—the university’s Office of Internet Technologies, or something like that—where I find some troubleshooting suggestions for connecting to my dorm’s network. I finally connect to the Internet and decide that it’s time to shower. Then I realize that I don’t have any body wash, either, so I go back to the University Store and buy some. Then I go through the process of showering here for the first time, which is so ridiculous that I won’t even try to explain it. Then I brush my teeth, and, since I packed some, decide to try to floss, which I haven’t done regularly in years. My gums bleed instantly and the floss gets so stuck between my teeth that it takes me a full minute to finally break the string and pull it out. I spit blood into the sink. Then I notice that I’ve spat into a sink in which the faucet doesn’t run, so I have to turn on the faucet of the sink next to it and scoop palmfuls of water from it to wash away the blood. 92 Yuwen is watching Terminator 3 on that huge television.  I sit and watch with him. Arnold Schwarzenegger, as the good terminator, picks himself up, after he’s been left for dead by the bad, female terminator. His cybernetic head barely hangs on. “Sometimes, it’s better to be dead than alive,” Yuwen says. “Like when your head is dangling from your neck?” I ask. “No, like when you’re a slave. ” He doesn’t clarify any further. We keep watching the movie. 93 I pick up the two new Bright Eyes albums, I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, plus the new Ani DiFranco album, Educated Guess. It’s morning, so I listen to I’m Wide Awake… first. I finish listening to it just as my wanderings lead me to the dining common. I already settled everything I wanted to do/to know about my meal plan, so I’m ready to eat there for the first time. I’m swiped in. I walk to get a tray, then immediately see June. She has just finished her first shift working here. She gives me a tour of where things are. I’m excited, even though I’ve arrived at the end of breakfast time and before lunch food is out. Fruit! And muffins! And eggs! I have very low standards when it comes to food. 94 I return to the dining common in the evening. Lucky is working there. She says hello to me as I’m pondering tortellini. I begin to eat and am ridiculously happy with the experience of doing so. I’m so busy thinking about how well taken care of I feel here at college that I don’t even notice, until she speaks, that she’s wiping down the table next to me. I explain that this is my first day eating here in the DC (Dining Common), yeah, it’s my first time living on campus, oh, I was living in Chicopee, a little over a half hour south, with my mom, yeah, but before that I had an apartment in Northampton. Upon hearing this last part, she asks, “Oh, are you old?” I laugh, and say, “Yes, twenty-three. ” “Well,” she says, “I’m young, so most people are old to me. ” Then she figures that she’d better get back to work. I thank her for stopping to talk. 95 Yuwen says that he’s found a room I can move into. I don’t understand the details, which leads me to believe there are things he’s purposely not telling me. He seems to think that I should speak to the appropriate administrators and tell them that I should move into this particular room. “Who’s the roommate?” I ask. “He’s Asian,” he replies. “Well, does he have a name?” He doesn’t answer, and I don’t like repeating questions. 96 Yuwen wakes up before I do on the first day of classes. I fall back to sleep, but not for long, because apparently I’ve somehow set the annoying buzzer part of my dual alarm clock, which jars me into full alertness earlier than I would have liked. It’s snowing, and the snow is sticking to the ground. It’s a bit of a mess. I walk to Campus Center and get a coffee from the Starbucks stand, then go outside with it, light a cigarette, and sit down where the snow doesn’t reach. I return to the Starbucks stand and ask the lady there about campus jobs in food service. She refers me to the Blue Wall. The guy I talk to there says he’s in charge of hiring, tells me where I should go to get an application, and says to come back to him on Sunday. I take the elevator, as he has instructed, and figure that I should follow the signs to the Food Services Office. Once there I follow a series of posted xeroxes reading “Students Jobs”. The final sign points directly into a wall, but after a moment I notice that a stack of work applications are resting on the carpet next to this wall, so I’m all set. It feels good to return to Latin class. Strange, but true. 97 Thirty people show up for the morning section of Martín Espada’s workshop course. Apparently they’re familiar with his work. Fewer than half of the people there are actually registered for the class. He tries to move as many of us as possible to the afternoon section. I’m nervous because I couldn’t open up that time slot and, having communicated in advance with this professor about taking the course, I’m relying on being able to officially enroll. Otherwise I would need to revise my schedule completely, sell back books, and the whole thing would be a giant mess. He reluctantly signs me up for the morning section, which is a big relief. After attending the introduction to the discussion section of American Drama, I walk across campus to the lecture component. It’s taught by Professor Donohue, who boosted my self-esteem with his positive evaluation of my essays in the Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama course last semester. Of course, that was a seminar, while this is a fairly large lecture. 98 Yuwen is whistling a tune. He asks if I recognize the song.  “Yeah,” I say, “That’s ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’. ” Excited, he downloads the version he’s familiar with, the ukulele version from the movie 50 First Dates. He downloaded the Judy Garland version, he says, but that it sucked, and sounded “all, like, 1970s”. This is cute, but when he goes to sleep with the version that he likes playing on repeat, well… that’s less cute. 99 The first day of Medieval Studies. Larger than I would have expected for this particular course. Full of expressionless faces. I get there early and read from my old, battered Johnny the Homicidal Maniac collection. I get the impression that this course will be less demanding than I figured. Should be interesting, but still just a survey of the field: major texts will be a bunch of excerpts photocopied together. Short answer mid-term, final, and a couple of quizzes. I’m sort of expecting to hear from Julian, I think we’re going to meet up at some point, but I’m not sure when. He has a new cell phone and seems to be unable to text message me now. I’m getting used to eating dessert in the form of sundaes at the D. C. The weather is very cold, still, and prevents me from wanting to leave the campus. Now that I have the syllabi for all of my classes and I’ve gauged what to expect from each of them, I’m surprised to find that I feel my workload is insufficient. I don’t want the amount of free time that living on campus with this particular schedule would allow me. I’m thinking about those six credits I was planning to earn over next summer and/or winter session. Credits that can be earned during breaks tend to be from limited, low-level courses, taught by grad students. Wouldn’t I rather be studying within my fields of interest? Wouldn’t that be better as preparation for graduate work? Hey, when did I start planning to go to grad school? Julian calls while I’m busy thinking and plotting. I haven’t showered, and I’d like to. So, while he’s saying that he’s on his way from work, towards UMass and ultimately to Sunderland, and he’s saying that I should get on the bus with him as it comes by my house, I’m saying that I need to think, and I’m having a tough time communicating, too many thoughts in my head, thinking thinking busy thinking, but I tell him that I’ll call him back later when I’m ready and then I’ll take a bus on my own up to… …his girlfriend Ellie’s apartment, oh, he meant for tonight that Ellie had invited me over to play Scrabble? Okay. And Yuwen’s asleep, he sleeps at random times for random lengths of time (putting the awry nature of my sleeping history to shame; he says that the naps are a Chinese thing, although he says that about a lot of things) and I go online and register for Studies in Modern Fiction, which sounds like it will do its best to occupy any time of mine which might otherwise have been free.

    "body": "100 So cold. Still cold. Always cold. But riding the bus at night is peaceful, one of my favorite pasttimes; at least, this is enjoyable to me once it stops being overcrowded, once the bus has moved away from campus and is on its way up to Sunderland. Ellie’s place is cozy. I feel welcomed. Ellie’s very mellow; she’s playing Final Fantasy VIII and continues to do so once I’ve arrived. Her roommate, Long-haired Ashley, has a guest over and is making some sort of ginger noodle dish with mushrooms? Some food I don’t understand. I’ve already told Julian that I forgot to eat, and he sees that I turn down an offer of some of this dish, which I imagine plays a role in his asking whether we can make some macaroni and cheese. So nice! But it’s really not just me who’s hungry, it turns out, because all of us have some. Julian gives me a nice backrub. Long-haired Ashley plays for us all an absurd bit of music on her computer, which is a bunch of Queen songs put together translated into Japanese. Her room is striking, with its framed page of original artwork from Strangers in Paradise and certificate of achievement in Latin on the wall from high school. After Julian tickles me Scrabble is played in the living room, five of us playing. The words are impressive, but the game is low scoring. The rules are bent, but we have fun. Julian wins, Ellie takes second place, Ashley’s guest takes third place, I’m fourth place, and Ashley is last place. I hear the Tori Amos b-side “Never Seen Blue” coming from Ashley’s room, and go in to confirm that I’m hearing correctly. She hugs me, because this is somehow her first time realizing that I’m a Tori fan. Eventually, Julian and I give each other a squeeze goodnight, and I take off to return to campus. 101 As I’m ready to go outside for a cigarette I look over curiously at the Chinese characters on Yuwen’s computer. He sees that I’m looking, and I tell him I’m just curious to see. He starts to talk about the Chinese language, then, and keeps talking for quite a while. He scribbles characters onto an envelope and has me guess at their meaning to show how much sense they make. “Can a person be a master of the English language if they know 5,000 words?” he asks. “No, I’d say not,” is my reply. “Chinese is hard to learn at first,” he continues, “But once you know the characters, you can understand anything that’s written. ” He goes on to say that in the East there’s not the jargon that there is in fields of Western study; that languages like English have been getting larger and larger, more and more difficult to understand. “So the magic works less and less of the time,” he says, “And by the time you’re in college it’s, like, random where you can and can’t use it. Because a word means one thing to some people and another thing to some other people. So the smaller groups come up with different words, but there’s less magic in each of the words, because less people are using them. In the end, everyone is weak. It’s a bad idea. It’s a really bad idea. It’s going to kill you someday. I’m serious. ” 102 I’m sitting with my laptop in a common space of the dorm house when a guy named Jim who lives here says, “Hello, person I met once when I was drunk who I forget the name of. ” We introduce ourselves to each other again. “You’re Julian’s boyfriend, right?” he asks. “Uh, yeah,” I reply, although this is not technically true. “That’s what I heard,” he says, “I met him once or twice. I know Kurt. He’s a friend of mine. ” Julian happens to call me immediately after I’ve had this conversation. “I don’t know who that person would be or how he would know anything about you and me having a relation to each other at all,” he says. 103 Julian comes by. We hang out in the Campus Center. He tells me that I’m welcome to come over, so I do. The next morning I’m invited to join in fast food eating with his mother, who happens to be in the area. I say no, choosing instead to go back to UMass and to study. But that night we do go to Smith College, for Brianna’s birthday celebration in one of the dorm houses. I’m drinking one of Draya’s Magic Hat beers and a good deal of Brianna’s mead. Draya is singing and being silly as she DJs from her iPod. Agatha is there; she’ll be graduating this year. When she leaves with her friend Brianna seems offended, figuring that they’re having “hot lesbian sex” and leaving her out of it. Smoke break outside with Brianna, a girl named Kate, and I forget the other gal’s name. Talking about how easy it would be to have a sense of bisexual community, except that bisexuals seem to rarely want to define themselves. A cuddle pile inside—Julian giving Brianna a massage, then bringing me in for cuddles, while Morte is massaging the Kate. Then the Kate is giving long, intense bites to Brianna and Julian while I watch the resulting expressions. Brianna and I kiss for a little bit. Morte drives us back to Julian’s. I’m in the backseat with Julian resting on me. Morte is playing the CD of some band that’s pretty good, whose singer he has said reminds him of my vocals. 104 Nothing really happens on Sunday except that I finish reading The Great Gatsby. I forget to return to campus early, so I don’t get to talk to that guy about food service work. 105 Julian sleeps over Monday night. Yuwen has a new comfort mattress he’s putting on the bed; he’s making such hideously large amounts of noise as we’re trying to fall asleep and wow, seriously, it takes a lot to bother me at all, but even so, it’d take even more for me to say anything about the matter. All he talks to me about now seems to be what he thinks is my inevitable departure from this dorm room. 106 The week goes by, full of study. Wednesday night I go on my own to Koffee Haus, which is the basement of the Van Meter dorm in the Central area of campus. The trek there involves the climbing of a rather steep, high hill, and my U-card doesn’t let me outside (as a resident of a different dorm) so I have to wait for someone to let me in. I’m there for the open mic. I’ve met a couple of people who are there. I’m third on the list. I play “Aldous Huxley” and “Everyone Here in the Scene”. Then, I go to check out this Koffee Haus’s selection of teas (after all, they appear not to have coffee), and I’m considering the menu—the teas are designed according to which chakra one would like to clear—when there’s a fire drill. I really wanted some tea, too! Waiting outside, I check the time. I need to read 1/3 of Beowulf and memorize a chapter of Latin vocabulary before I go to sleep, so I walk back to Hamlin. As soon as my books are opened, our own fire alarm goes off… but fortunately, this drill goes quickly. Someone who was in my Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama class last semester, and who is apparently dating June, happens to be in several classes with me—my Modern Drama (lecture and lab) and Modern Fiction (lab only). He likes to greet me by saying “Salve!” although I don’t think he knows I’m taking Latin. Thursday evening, I nap. Yuwen’s also napping at first, but then he’s awake and coming in and out and the light’s on and the pipes are making lots of noise and so I’m awake then into the wee hours of the morning some reading chapters from A People’s History of the United States I had barely noticed were assigned for Modern Fiction. 107 Weekend = sleep. At my mother’s house, then at Julian’s house. And on Sunday I feel a bit sick: throat is dry, back is feeling achey all day. And Julian, I don’t know, but sometimes the way he looks at me seems to show something so different than what I feel when I look at him. I suppose my instinct was always very positive about him, that things will be okay, whatever happens. But he seems to try so hard in his mind, sometimes, and then it’s tough for me to relax, because I don’t feel like he’s relaxed, and I feel like there’s something he’s hoping from me, some sort of reassurance for something, something I don’t understand. And whether I show it or not, I worry a lot about his feelings, and I’m accustomed to him being in my life. 108 Sore throat. Feeling lonely in the day. I see Katie from Ware at the DC, with a somewhat annoying guy from one of her classes. Then I take a bus to Northampton and visit Alix. Eric is there; the two of them have been dating. Alix and I play a game of Go. She wins. I meet Julian as he’s getting out of work. I ride the bus with him to UMass. We sit at Campus Center until it’s time for him to catch a bus back to Sunderland. 109 Wednesday, remaining vacancies are available from the Housing Assignment Office on a first come, first served basis. I skip my poetry workshop to wait in line. I keep re-reading passages from Thorstein Mansion-Might for Medieval Studies class because the students around me are a bit loud, saying the sorts of silly things that dorm residents tend to say. I’m reassigned to a room in Baker, which is in the Central area (a couple houses down from Van Meter, where I went to the open mic). 110 I’m with Julian when I meet the guy to whose room I’ve been assigned. Julian is less frightened than I am by the half-naked-lady beer posters and merchandise from professional sports teams. 111 Yuwen has seen me as quiet and studious, well-tempered. From the start he was trying to “help me” to move out so he could have the room to himself for another semester. Then he finds that I’ll actually be moving, and he wonders if he hasn’t made a mistake. He says he imagines my new roommate will appreciate me, because I can be a good influence. After all, he says, this semester so far he’s really been more dedicated to coursework and the room hasn’t been so much a place for people to hang out and watch his big television. Maybe that kind of a social life isn’t much of a social life. You must have an angel, right? Or angels, he says, and I sort of laugh. He says that I don’t have to say it, he can tell from what I’ve said already, like that I went to community college and I’m here for the education. Maybe more people would be able to try so hard if they had had troubles in the past, he says. The ones who have it easy, they don’t need guidance from the future any more than they need guidance from the present, because their life is already planned out and there’s only so much they could do differently. Well-to-do, Yuwen knows that he’ll earn lots of money. It’s been seven years since he came to this country and began to learn the language. He says he wonders what it’s like to feel that your decisions make a difference. Howsoever few of my friends I have around me these days, at the age of twenty-three living in a college dorm for the first time because I can for the first time, and why not?, I think there are different kinds of loneliness. Mine is a pretty good kind, really. I am a very fortunate person. “You know the angels are Chinese, right? But we won’t tell you that. But it’s going to be us. No one else could change the timelines in this way, systematically, so you can see that it’s organized. ” “I never thought about it,” I say. “Probably America invents the technology. But we’re the ones who use it. ” 112 Bruce is very cool about helping me move, again. We get things in before long. The roommate isn’t there. I fall asleep listening to the laughter of the kids outside. Then I wake up to a couple of guys entering the room, chatting. It’s like 2:30 in the morning. Probably back from some party. They don’t turn the light on, don’t make too much noise. One is using my roommate’s computer to show pictures to the other one. Overhearing, I gather that what they’re looking at is pretty gory. Okay, I figure, they must be at one of those sites with pictures of accident scenes and stuff. Then: “Did you take these pictures?” “No, there was a guy whose job it was just to take the pictures. ” No Iraqis left alive. Corpses chewed up by dogs. This is a soldier showing off pictures of what happened after his unit went through somewhere in that occupied country. The guy who has been shown these pictures says, “This just makes me respect even more what you guys do over there. Keeping us free. ” The soldier says, “You know, when you’ve been hating these guys for so long, it’s great to see them die. ” My roommate and another friend come in. I get my shoes on, grab my bag, smoke a cigarette outside, wander the house looking for somewhere to hide, but there is nowhere for me to be. All I smell anywhere is weed. What looks like a study room is empty but for a table and a cup-littered floor and a girl looking disoriented hunched in the corner. Our eyes meet for a second as I walk by more quickly. Afraid of everything, I call Bruce and say that I don’t want to live on campus anymore. 113 A little bit cold waking up. A desire for coffee, of course. I was lucky to remember that there’s a bathroom down here: I don’t think I’ve ever sneezed so much snot from my body in one sneeze before, so I rather needed that tissue. In Long-haired Ashley’s parents’ basement in Connecticut. Julian’s on the couch. I’m sitting on the floor with this journal. It’s quite early—8:50. I could sit and stare at my copy of The Beekeeper. Alix called me yesterday while I was re-arranging my mother’s porch to be livable, and she told me that B-Side Records in Northampton was selling copies of this, the new Tori Amos album, already. (Its release date is Tuesday. ) I’ve listened to it once, but not closely enough to have a real opinion yet. I met with Julian at 8 PM and waited in the hallway in front of Ashley and Ellie’s apartment. About forty minutes. I kept asking silly and/or deep questions, missing the experience of conversation, feeling like I’ve been having no one to speak with, no occasions to speak. Then we were at a bar in Manchester, Connecticut. A band was playing. And Julian fed me peanuts. Everyone took turns wearing his hat. 114 I text messaged Helena to mention that it’s something like an anniversary for us—since I have The Beekeeper now, and I met her when we were both buying Scarlet’s Walk. 115 Television is harder to watch now that all the news anchors are Archie Bunker.

    "body": "116 Quote of the day comes from a guest speaker in class, there to talk about the Crusades: “I’m sure you can imagine, it’s surprising and a little worrisome to Medievalists when they start regularly being asked to speak in front of a general audience because their field of study is relevant to current events. ” 117 Julian: “I’m selfish. I wanted to keep the way we talked and were friends and were open to each other… but I also wanted to have the physical side of things. I guess sometimes these things just don’t work out. ” Me: “Maybe we’d have needed to save up more… karmic credits… before hoping to get out of that compromise. (Pause) I’m sorry my nonsensical metaphysical metaphor made you start crying again. (Pause) I’m also sorry that I’m congratulating myself right now because I like the way that last phrase sounded. (Pause) But I’m not sorry that you’re smiling now. (Pause) But I’m also not sorry that you’re crying, if crying is helpful. (Pause) I know that at times like these it can feel good to have the sting of tears in your eyes… but by now, I think you’ll be feeling that anyway, no matter how many tears I wipe away. ” Julian. : “No. No, that’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever done for me. ” He said that he fell in love with me quickly, because he never entertained the possibility that I might fall in love with him, too. Because, ‘No one ever does’. And he doesn’t understand when people have reservations about getting into heavy emotions. “I think you should remember,” I said, “That when people have reservations about these things, they’re asking for something. They’re asking for you to say that certain things are okay. It’s just sometimes really hard to figure out what those things are that people want you to say are okay. ” 118 Julian messaged me to say that he had overreacted and that we should still be friends after all, even if we can’t be lovers too. 119 Last night was a Friday. Visiting Alix, sitting and chatting. Me, I’m doing better as far as keeping myself satisfied, although I feel like ghosts are trying to seduce me and I’m needing to run away from them. Writing a lot of poetry for the workshop course, and stories also. Alix needed to pretty herself up for a night on the town. She was going bowling, I think, with Laurie and someone else. I, meanwhile, had made plans to go over to Salma’s. Janelle was at Salma’s with her sister. It was intended as a sort of movie night. I forget Janelle’s sister’s name, but she was cool. Johnny (Salma’s boyfriend) showed up with groceries, he has basically moved in with Salma now. And two other people, a male and female, were present. Johnny blew smoke rings with a plastic trash can whose bottom had a hole in it (using some sort of chemical) and with a water jug made little bursts of flame that were startling and amusing in the dark. Beer and pizza. The DVD player wouldn’t work, so no movie was watched. Lots of hetero-woman anti-male sentiment, with apologies to me. Then to Lydia’s twenty-fourth birthday party, which reminds me the two of us have been acquainted for going on five years now. Julian was there; we greeted each other with a great hug. After he left with a guy whom he’d met before (and Britta was looking to start to clear people out anyway) I left. Still very immersed in coursework. Today, read The Emperor Jones before short story writing. Alix put together her first demo CD to give to friends. It’s good to have something of hers that I can listen to. She has lots of new songs; I don’t. Last week was an Oscars party/not quite party at Britta’s. Charlie and Tina were there. Being around them, I feel like I suddenly can remember who I am. After that was the event of Julian really breaking down crying in my car. I’m finished with my tea, so I’m going to stop writing now. 120 Well, here I am at The Thirsty Mind with a coffee. I just finished up Latin homework. Monday night, or more accurately I should say Tuesday morning, at around 1 AM, Marie invited me over. I felt up for just such an irresponsible adventure, so off I went. Ellington, Connecticut. She had coffee ready. She had shaved her head. Oh, we talked about everything, as usual. It seemed out of nowhere to me, but she told me that she had gotten into Paganism, inspired by her birth mother. (She was reunited with her birth mother only… two years ago now, perhaps?) The two of us also discussed music. I told her about the new Tori Amos disc; she told me about the new R. E. M. We were on some frivolous topic when I decided to ask, “What is love?” which sent her, and us, into an extended, deeper, somewhat philosophical talk. Partway into it, I asked her to connect what she was saying with the topic of religion. She spent some amount of time (forty-five minutes?) talking about The Celestine Prophesy while I sat on the floor between the coffee table and the loveseat and we smoked cigarettes and drank coffee. I fell asleep on the couch at about 5 AM. Around 6, I woke up from a dream. I wrote down what I remembered: “Apartment, unidentified. I keep knowing this scary woman is going to come. I don’t know it, I feel it. The scary woman and Mandy storm in. I’m forgetting what happened. Mandy + the woman in bathroom. I hear them talking about me, targeting me, focusing hostility, engaging in sex acts. ‘Hello?’ to Mandy and the woman in bathroom but they don’t hear. I enter, Mandy is standing naked with a bath towel, looking emaciated and surprised that the other isn’t there. Post on Internet: Tori Amos is looking for songwriters to meet. I think to myself, maybe when she’s back in Chicago or Cleveland, because we’re in the Great Lakes region for some reason (me + Alix). An investigator (police) and psychic help me out of the house. I feel the essence of the scary woman from earlier, driving by. (We’re in an enclosed porch, out the front door). ‘There’s someone behind us,’ he said, ‘He’s either going to attack or retreat because he doesn’t know _____ (something about what this kind of attack is). ’ ‘No,’ I say, ‘She. And she’s a ghost. ’” I fell back asleep, then awoke soon after? to Marie saying hi, and would we have coffee before I left? But I must have just been falling back to sleep. I missed Latin class that morning, finally woke up around 10? 11? Found that I was supposed to be meeting Julian at UMass, he was texting me reminders (his phone disconnected so I couldn’t respond, somehow thought he could still send messages) so eventually I got to campus, it was starting to snow, I met him at the Game Hobbyists’ League office. Ate some food while he watched, then he left. Medieval Studies class, the snow outside is getting worse, someone says class is canceled. “Class is canceled?” the girl next to me asks. “That’s what it sounds like,” I respond. It turns out that this is the Jill Z. with whom I’ve been chatting online. I could have suggested—this would have been the perfect occasion—that we hang out, then, with class being unexpectedly canceled and all… but I felt like acting ‘responsible’ again, driving home ASAP. I knew that because of the weather the drive was going to suck. And it did. It was terrible. I slept for like 12 hours starting that evening. I have two days left before Spring break now. Spring break, which means about nothing to me at the moment. Did I mention that I have tickets to see Tori Amos in Hartford? I wrote for the in-class assignment today (to write an ode) “Ode to an Ice Cream Sandwich” because I started writing “Ode to King Kong” and it wasn’t working out. 121 Well, here we are—my Spring break. This involves no travel for me or anything. I have a play to read—Machinal—and a part of the Res gestae divi augusti to translate. Part of me wishes there were more, because it’s just like that. I’ve been journal-writing and doing poetry… but there’s no ongoing project to get down to, nothing that’s been itching at the back of my mind. I’m not even reading start-to-finish through any books on my own, only skipping around through a volume of Borges. 122	It’s tough when I spill my tea and I’ve just settled down at a table. I’m disappointed that Zella didn’t end up coming out here from Boston this weekend. (Her trip was canceled due to the snow. ) This tea is good but still a little too hot. Conversation I am overhearing about pro- and anti-war sentiments in churches. “Other cultures had that before but (…) Indian culture believed in that but (…) Western type mind (…) ironic we’ve come so far (…) understand how connected everyone is (…) is beautiful. Even though (…) faith in God, God is perfect. It’s going to bring people together. ” “I like your optimism. On the other hand (…) problem (…)” “Complex issue (…) yeah I’ve heard a lot of some people want to go backwards in time (…) gospels (…) Jesus said to look forward. Can’t go backward, then you’re not progressing (…) talked to some Muslims (…) I have problems with some of the rhetoric they preach (…) What is the actual conflict? Everyone wants compromise, but (…) we haven’t learned much from history. Why is the Middle East always (…) lots of tribes in the area (…) constantly fought (…) diversity is a good thing (…) change is always good (…) how our country was built (…) Fundamentalists (…) freedom is an important fact. We don’t want to lose that. Media needs to do a better job (…) Republicans (…) Democrats (…) as a Christian nation, when did God become pro-rich? (…) I don’t like to complain too much (…) using every possible resource (…) I really have (…) mistake in Iraq of trusting intelligence (…) hold onto what I know (…) lot of problems. Big business is a problem. ” There’s that. They’re still talking, but I’ve taken what I needed to. Passion tea. Though I admit, I’m still stuck eavesdropping and it’s a challenge to stop. “Reassurances (…) pessimistic thinking doesn’t work (…) I used to be a pessimist (…) it kept going in that direction. ” (“Across the Universe” performed by I don’t know who. ) “Have to look beyond that (…) national pride (…) Germany (…) big example of that (…) hard for people to be persuaded (…) wouldn’t it be ironic (…) the very place (…) things started (…) Middle East becomes the place where it all comes together beautifully? (…) Mark, huh? I love the gospels (…) get filled with reassurance (…) everything’s gonna be okay. ” I guess I’m not actually going to write about myself here. 123 Thinking of why I leave these stories, this documentation thing. I tried giving it up. And I haven’t even worked out what exactly this documentation thing is… but I tried to give it up, circa 2003, decided that I would get rid of all what I was starting to think of as baggage—all that writing. And I figured that I would just write one story, just one book, one autobiography. But I was writing it, and after a point it didn’t make sense in that format. Somehow, the story of my life—and for some reason, I want to keep it written down—for some reason, that story is more than just a sequence of events. It’s a sequence of methods, it’s a sequence of paradigms, it’s a sequence of big words discovered. It’s a progression from love as life to art as life to love as art as life to nothing as life to everything as life to I don’t know what life is to it doesn’t matter. Not necessarily in that order. But here I am, keeping so much of this secret—posting small bits, small bits posted to the Internet, but not much. And then there’s more here. And will there be anyone else to hear? I wonder whether there will ever be anyone else to hear. Even when I pay to own books of the journals of dead writers, how far do I get into reading those books? Sometimes I poke around. I start at a point, maybe the beginning, think that I’m going to read through it all, but then I don’t. I was reading Lydia’s notebook on the floor of what’s like her studio room there in her mother’s house in Greenfield, Massachusetts. I was early, picking her up, we were going to a party, she had called unexpectedly and said, “Would you be interested in going to a party tonight?” and I had said, “I would. ” And I forget what I was writing about. I forget what I read in her notebook. And blah, blah, blah. I want to exercise and lose weight. I want to hold a love and spin them around and be spun around and be validated in my self-esteem spin spin wheeeeeeeeee oooooooo yeah baby do it that way what am I talking about I wonder who’s online. I recently had a dream, another dream. Once you start keeping track of your dreams, you start keeping track of your dreams. There is a woman—a therapist—and me. She’s being pursued by people in power, for a mystical practice of hers? I don’t know the reason, and I ask her why, she almost tells me, then she’s like, “You know what? No. ” Because there’s no reason to tell me. She is somewhat comically not-cautious (she is given advice where not to go, she goes there) but stays one step ahead of pursuers. She is savvy, urban, queer, beyond my reach. At the same time, I am this woman, which is a confusing point. 124 Well, okay. At Lydia’s place. She sets me down in her art studio room type thing, says I can play her records to entertain myself, and I can peek through her notebooks too, notebooks that ponder art, living, the universe, with notes for community college courses interspersed. The snow’s sticking up there in Franklin county, but not as we drive south toward Easthampton… to The Spiral Gallery, the house I first saw while picking up Kerrin, a little over a year ago I think, although also I’ve been to one or two of these parties. First I wait for people who already have accounts to log themselves in (done at a counter just inside the door, someone with a laptop). Last time they were doing this on paper. Some of the guests at the party: Tina, Long-haired Ashley (Julian’s girlfriend Ellie’s roommate, remember? She liked Tori Amos and wasn’t very good at Scrabble?), Fuller, Graff, that guy who recently was dating Alice, and plenty of others. Tina was particularly nice to me on this night. (Her words: “I’m being so nice to you tonight!”) A gal I hadn’t met before, who with me was chatting on the smoking porch for a while at one point said to me and Tina, “So many compliments! Does this mean you two are going home together tonight?” and I said, “Ha, no, she’s just going to give me a hug right now. We’ve known each other a long time. ” And Tina said what she always says: “Levi’s the reason I came to the Valley. ” I chatted with Fuller’s roommate, asking her general questions about what graduate school is like. Ashley and I shared some witty banter. (“We’re Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are Dead-ing the meta-ing of our verbiage. ”) There were three people at the party who each had a turn twirling fire outside, where a circle had been made out of the snow; people watched and clapped. Of course, there was that nice dance floor in the basement, the house’s own personal nightclub, and I danced to some goth/industrial tunes. Drank wine. Graff was nice to me. I readied myself to leave around 5 in the morning, but Lydia wanted to stay and found someone who would drive her home in the morning. And she made funny looks at me as I was leaving, so I kept looking at her with a quizzical expression, and she was like, eh, uh, I dunno what that was. Because that’s Lydia’s style. And I woke up still before noon on Sunday. Ate some food with Alix in the afternoon, Friendly’s in Northampton. Wrote a poem at night. Now it’s Monday, all I’ve done is (waking up was hard) gone to Amherst, sat in Starbucks trying to write the beginning of a story. Bought some comic books in Northampton, and here I am in Haymarket, overhearing Theater Instructor Sheryl Stoodley’s distinctive voice loud among the chatter, upstairs here, in a place I’ve been a customer of so many, many times. Oh, and at the party, that guy who recently was dating Alice got very serious and emotional to me. And he said he always heard good things about me from her, that “it was always ‘Levi this’, ‘Levi that’” and that I’m a good guy. 125 That was a surprising night. Tuesday, during my week of Spring break. Pretty much going crazy from boredom during the afternoon. I was so bored, in fact, that when my hopes of getting coffee with Jill Z. from Medieval Studies were thwarted I did something that I really wasn’t sure I wanted to be doing—I went to Haven. My night was surprising because it was just so good. Saw Tina, Tingley, Laurel, Julian, and Evan, his longtime friend who’s visiting from Cape Cod… what am I doing? As if I can list everyone I know at that club on any given night. It seemed like a very old-school crowd, there were several people who said they hadn’t seen me in a while, whom I pretended to remember. Maurice was there, looking to inform people that he’s selling tickets to Jim Carroll, for whom he’ll be opening with his slam poetry. Tingley and I talked about the movie I Heart Huckabee’s. Tina was sad because she feels like she can’t make people swoon the way she used to—a rough thing for her because that’s, like, what she is spiritually. When Julian and Evan were leaving, Evan and I had big hugs. He remembered that I give the best hugs in the world. That guy who runs up to people, talks intimately with them, then runs away was there. He remembered my name. Oh, and Jay from Collapse Into Reason, he was nice to me by noticing that I hadn’t been around and sort of questioning me on it and saying it’d be cool for me to get out more often. Also, Harvey wears glasses now, which is a fucking random and unimportant piece of information with which to finish this journal entry. So I won’t end the entry here. When I left the club and returned to the car, I found text messages from Helena (with whom I had also recently spoken online. ) Isn’t it dumb for me to even think about writing that down? Is that creepy? Not as creepy as she is, all mysterious yet that other quality that’s not mysterious at all at the same time. Look at all these words. Where am I going with this? I have a date with a nineteen year old tomorrow. Now that I’m getting older, I’ll call anything a date. (Oh, and I danced at the club. A lot. Still not enough people dance when they play “Girl Anachronism” by the Dresden Dolls. ) (Dancing I really, really miss when I don’t do it for a while. Keeps me a little more in shape, even. ) Is this stuff unreadable by now? La la la I’m totally going to type this up waste words frivolous garbage thee words don’t matter don’t matter (yes they do).

    "body": "126 I thought to stop for a drink on St. Patrick’s Day. Being alone, I figured it best to go somewhere familiar, where maybe I would see some friendly faces. I pulled into the Diva’s parking lot. It just so happened that my cousin, Ken, was pulling into the spot next to me. (He goes to the club somewhat regularly. ) We went inside, talked about the family. Some time passed, he danced, I people-watched. Then I found him on the smoking porch, talking to a somewhat annoying guy. I forget what brought the conversation to this point, but my cousin mentioned to the somewhat annoying guy: “I have an identical twin. He’s straight, but people don’t believe that his identical twin can be gay if he’s not. ” I grew up with Ken and his brother Chris, and of course I knew that the latter was straight, but I had never actually thought about how confusing this fact might be. I sat alone at the bar and started another beer. I was tackled by Erik. Pretty drunk at the time, he included me in a round of kamikazes and introduced me to his current co-worker, we’ll call him A. , a guy who immediately began flirting with me. Erik said to A of me, “He’s as straight as they come. ” And I think I made a face. And Erik was like, “You’re not?” I acted shy and was like, “Well, no. ” And he said, “Are you gay?” And I said, “Nah. ” “So you’re just trying to mess with me. ” “No…” Erik vanished. A. kept calling me beautiful, slurring his speech. I liked the attention. He said, as if looking for someone who’d relate to him, that he was straight, but that hanging out with Erik was confusing that. I decided that I had had enough flirtation with intoxicated strangers after A. suddenly said something like, “Bring me a beer, bitch!” to the bartender, who shook her head because he had been yellow-lighted two kamikazes ago. 127 Anyway, I didn’t write about how on Wednesday, I hung out with Jill Z. It was weird. If, as planned, we had hung out at night when I was feeling terribly bored and lonely, that would have been one thing… but we had rescheduled it to this next day and so it really did feel like a date. She’s nineteen, a freshman, and her mother was looking out the door to watch her get in the car with me. Bizarre. That would have unnerved me even four years ago. I took her to The Blue Moon on Sumner Ave. in Springfield. We played Scrabble Deluxe there and then her friend came by, who perhaps was even younger. Age isn’t the most important factor. They’re just in a different world, a Mom-is-looking-out-the-door world. Jill said that we should do it again, but we shouldn’t. Chatting online is fine. Then Friday, I went with Julian to Grandstands in Northampton for Karaoke. A couple gamer friends of his arrived. I had vaguely encountered them before. I sang “Tom Sawyer” and “California Dreamin’”. Then Julian and I went to the diner, encountered another group of her friends and sat with them. Robyn was getting out from her shift. She said hey to me. 128 On Alix’s floor. Listening to Extraordinary Machine, the shelved Fiona Apple album leaked to the Internet. Alix is in pajamas looking at a cookbook, Leigh’s going to come over with butter. 129 Easter. Little cousin Kelli sleeping on the living room couch. Cousin Chris, he’ll be off to Florida for school soon enough and is anxious about it. “Jesus loves prostitutes,” he’s saying, and his mother/my aunt Brenda is saying, “Heh, wouldn’t your father love to hear these things if he were here. ” (My father, always ready to be set off, and seriously Catholic, he often lectured my mother’s side of the family on, ‘How can you not know the Lord’s Prayer?’ and such) and some guy a couple years younger than I am, I feel it would be rude to ask who he is and how he’s connected to the family, he’s talking about the thrill of driving fast cars and the glories of binge drinking. People talking about the little kids picking up cuss words, and my mom points to me and says, “My son doesn’t swear!” and I think, “Hm, I don’t very much, comparatively, do I?” and another aunt of mine, is she really planning to go to the casino today? I don’t know, but I had a slice of apple pie and some coffee, watched some of Crocodile Dundee, cozied up in a chair reading Our Town between snippets of conversation. 130 Last semester, when my Creative Writing instructor found out that I had been working in a convenience store, she was like, “Oh, wow, that sounds great!” in a way that could only be said by someone who had been in school all her life. 131 A headache left me huddled on the couch watching multiple episode of Strange Love, the reality show of Brigitte Nielsen and Flavor Flav. It started off seeming forced. Then it was exciting. Then there was my favorite of the episodes, when their respective characters started to break down; Brigitte’s face, as she drank whiskey on the way to a church, showed the same thing that Flav’s did after three of his children had crashed the show to call him a deadbeat dad—a sort of nothingness. I was like, “Now here are humans as I know them—indistinct when they can no longer effectively perform for the show. ” 132 I was going to hang out with Alix, but she called back to say that she heard Eric was coming home to her to do something sweet, “And it might not be best, then, if he came home to find me and you sitting around with a bottle of wine. ” True enough. So I went to Diva’s—it was Thursday night, mind you, and my only Friday class, Latin, had been canceled in advance because of the professor’s need to do something out of town. And I had seen my father. Funny how that’s not at the forefront of my thoughts, but yes, he bought me lunch and we walked around Amherst center, and we walked around the Hampshire Mall. And it was okay. He’s not bad like he used to be, I can stand being around him. And, of course, it’s sad that I don’t have a better relationship with him… but I have to take what I can get and not dwell on what’s not there. But, back to Thursday night. Diva’s. Cousin Ken is there again, because an ex of his is back and town and he came to hang out with him, I think. And Maurice. Liv. Katie. It was okay. Best was when I could stand at the bar with Katie and Liv and Shamus, someone new. Then I was crazy—my mind a fog of emotions, it’s something I’ve been struggling with in recent weeks and it’s based largely on loneliness, and on an unfulfilled want to “open up to people”. And when I got back into my car (rain drizzling onto the windshield) my cell phone beeped with a text message. It was Julian. I called him back and we talked for something like a half hour, which was strange, especially considering that he was at Ellie’s. And I eventually said I really wanted not to be alone, and really it was like that. And he said I could stay over and I did. In the morning we went to the Route 9 Diner to eat, then saw Sin City at the Hampshire Mall. Whitehouse was at the new kiosk of his, whose first day of business it was, selling “random crap” like bouncy balls and Cat in the Hat hats. Ellie was there, too. Julian and I were going to move on and do something else. I said “Are you sure you don’t want to stay with Ellie?” and he said yes, but then as we kept walking he changed her mind and said that, on second thought, he’d like to stay. Which only reminded me how complicated that romance he feels for me is, and how strange it is that I’ve been blaming my feeling of “distance” from him on that very romance. I got an oil change in Northampton. While it was being done I went to see Alix at work. She works at Hayfields these days, which used to be the Vermont Country Deli. We arranged to meet up at a certain time at Haymarket. I started homework on the steps of City Hall, then ate at Quizno’s, then got my coffee at Haymarket and once I had added my cream and sugar Alix was there. “Meet me outside,” I said, and I sat in that storefront in front of the mirror, looking at myself. My hair was still unwashed, I don’t look so bad, but I look less bad in Northampton where everyone’s a colorful character, where things are different than they are at UMass. There was Maurice pacing nearby but not really saying much of anything. Back to Alix’s house; while she changed in the bathroom I sang songs with her guitar in the living room, and afterwards she was like, “Are you okay?” and I was like, “No. ” I had already been talking to her about how it’s been feeling, something that I can’t actually describe right now as I’m writing these things down, but that I feel I managed to communicate there in her messy bedroom. Jonny arrived. Yeah, I hadn’t seen him for a while. He’s been in Florida. Things have changed. But I didn’t wish to aggravate that rift, had no reason to fear seeing him. He was driving some big van. We picked up a gal named Heather in Easthampton, who seemed nice, and who was quiet, and when I found out that she was my age I had a secret moment of strange excitement like I had found some other person who was in the same rare category of person as I’m in. Which just goes to show that being a tad older than the people you’re surrounded by most regularly (as in, at school) creeps into your consciousness. And we went to The Thirsty Mind, waiting for Eric to close up. And this guy Garrett, whom I’d met once before there at The Thirsty Mind, came later. We tried to play Scrabble, but it was half-hearted for all of us involved (me, Alix, and Heather), so we canceled it. Drank some wine. I decided to show Heather how to frolic, because she said she was getting strange bursts of energy? And I suggested it would be a good way to let that out. And other people were laughing at my presentation of How To Frolic, which I think I only ever did before for Alice, who certainly remembers it, it’s one of her favorite anecdotes about me. The dynamic between me, Alix, and Jonny… it was larger than life. Standing outside of the coffee shop, Alix hugged me, then Jonny hugged us; then Heather hugged us all. We were standing there, then, outside after midnight, huddled in a circle, when we began to sing songs—”Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer”, “You are My Sunshine”, “The Birthday Song”, “Eternal Flame”. For minutes. Who knows how long. I think we were singing “Somewhere over the Rainbow”, still in a group hug, when Eric and Garrett came up, the shop having been closed for the night, ready for us to go to the diner. That moment reminded me of how much time makes disappear. Time makes everything disappear, including histories. No—especially histories. Which is why, when I had spoken with Cousin Ken at the club the night before, when he had confided in me that he’s been writing poetry all these years, stuffing his poems into shoeboxes, never getting rid of any of it, he had needed to emphasize to me: “Looking back, I cringe at everything that I used to think I knew. ” What happens today will be re-interpreted. So few moments do we actually hold onto as models for our own future; the rest we would rather forget. We call this latter portion embarrassing and think that these embarrassing memories are of some archaic proto-self. Every day we need to justify ourselves to someone, so we sacrifice what we used to know in order to be more secure about today. The number of moments that seemed… intimate (in the non-scandalous way) between Alix and me. The number of those moments surprised me. When she was moody, bitchy to Eric, somehow I was the one who noticed what she was doing. Somehow, I was the one who understood without explanation. Before driving back to Chicopee, I stopped at the Cumberland Farms where I used to work. To get a coffee. And it felt like home. 133 Let us twist our tongue to extend this labyrinth in which we wander. 134 Those romantic images that Julian conjured, text messaging me about how I should, with him, see the White Mountains, and the place where that story of his—when he watched a meteor shower, alone—took place. Our last trip together, to Cape Cod, to his old stomping grounds and to a mostly empty (wintertime) Provincetown… that was a good time, but part of me is still so conscious of the differences between us, and the power dynamics, which I may not be ready to stare down straight in the eye, not just yet. Again, tonight, I hung out with Alix and Jonny (and after a certain point also with Eric and Garrett) and got lost in that universe, that being-around-people universe. We were so obnoxious, in our way, in public. 135 Waking up at two in the morning because sleep is a funny thing. Not sure how I feel. I got a voice message from Julian saying that he ran into Maurice, from whom he has purchased that Jim Carroll ticket on my behalf. Funny, because I’ve been seeing Maurice repeatedly and we’ve just never gotten around to making the transaction personally. Also, now I have lots of events coming up, which is nice. I have to see one of the UMass performances of Angels in America, Part One either this weekend or next. And this Saturday, maybe I’ll go to see Sonic Youth with Cat Power; Alix really wants to go and I admit that I’d like to go, although I’m not excited about paying for the thing. Sunday is Tori Amos. The weekend after that is the Jim Carroll show. The weekend after that, Friday, April 22 is my birthday, when Alix seems to think she’s taking me to the Ani DiFranco concert Eric bought her tickets for (because he doesn’t really care for Ani) although I’m going to ask and make sure he really doesn’t want to go… just because, I mean, it’s his birthday gift to her. And the 24th is The Dresden Dolls in Boston. Next month is The Dresden Dolls again, opening for Nine Inch Nails. On my drive home from campus yesterday I left funny messages on Alice’s and Salma’s respective voicemails. I was tired, which explains my bizarre mindset at the time. I had been coming close to falling asleep during the lecture about The Glass Menagerie. Also, over the course of the day, I had dropped off entries for the undergraduate writing contest (one entry for fiction, one for poetry), and my submissions for the “English Society’s” journal, Jabberwocky. Last night, something provoked me to take a walk to the 7-11 and back. I was thinking about What I’m Going To Do after I finish my B. A. , and browsing through old writings had taken me to strange places, and the truly artistic side of me felt sentimental yearnings for the way I used to be. When you’re in a specific period of your life, sometimes it’s hard to forget what you’re like the rest of the time. Oh, what am I talking about? What do I know about who I am?… 136 Today I saw a dachshund wait for traffic to pass, then cross at a crosswalk. That was more or less the cutest thing ever. 137 The Tori Amos show in Hartford. I finally went to a “Meet and Greet”. I had nothing better for her to sign than my Latin text of the Res gestae divi augusti. By then I was slightly sunburned. I also ate dinner with strangers, which is one of my favorite things to do. 138 I need to find a place to live. I am officially an English major—by special arrangement, like everything else I do. Getting ‘A’s in everything. Writing productively. Still set to graduate next year. When I visit the old convenience store it feels like it’s the home I can never go back to. My maternal grandparents celebrated their fiftieth anniversary; with their eight children and fifteen grandchildren present it was difficult to find a place to sit, so I sat on a plastic table, which broke underneath me. 139 Alix has started a writer’s group that meets on Saturdays. Not much has happened so far except that exercises have been done, which I haven’t been able to get into at all. This Friday I saw Margaret Cho perform at Amherst College, then saw The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy that same night. A bunch of Phoenix Games regulars were at the same showing, and other familiars like Tina, Harvey, Kelsey, and Eric the Vespa Guy. "

    "body": "1 I hung out downtown today with Lyric and Kelsey, then with Vespa Eric. It was raining. Not as nice a rain as it could have been. Things are still humid and uncomfortable. When I got home there was a message on my machine saying that the realty people want to show my apartment at 9 AM. This is a rescheduling from yesterday at 9 AM, when the guy who shows the apartments entered to find me asleep in my clothes. He said no, no, we’ll do it some other time, that’s okay. But yesterday morning would have been better than tomorrow morning: I work graveyard shift tomorrow night. So now what do I do? If I nap tonight, and then I have to wake up for 9 AM, I’m not sure that I’ll be able to fall back asleep during the day. So, yes, the responsible thing to do would be to stay awake all night. But I’m not sure that I want to do that. And I definitely don’t feel like doing it. No, I feel like sleeping. What I’m avoiding writing about right now is the fact that I’m no longer in a relationship. This fact makes me feel like bears are going to come eat me—in the most optimistic sense, of course. But still. Definitely bears eating me. 2 I fell asleep as the sun was starting to rise. I had shuffled around a few things that were cluttering the floor—under the bed with you, oven pan!—to make sure that strangers could walk an unobstructed path and examine the air conditioner, and look outside at the small patch of grass that comes with the apartment. I was woken up around 1 PM, although theoretically the showing was for 9 AM. Prospective tenants seem about as punctual as repairpersons. This time it was a woman, 40-ish? younger? And also her friend, who seemed just there for moral support. Maybe the woman was planning to leave her husband, and was planning to move herself out from the place she has been sharing, and she was considering this apartment as the first place she would live on her own. And maybe this friend has been the one who’s saying, yes, do it, leave the bum. (I like to invent stories out of thin air like this. ) I’m so bad at answering questions when I first wake up. I have to say what I pay in electric? Oh, God, but that’s different every month! Now I have to estimate an average? Math? I was only just thinking about my dreams, how they feel somewhat distinct this morning. More organized, and sort of more peaceful than usual. Peaceful dreams. Then I sleep until, like, 6 PM I’m satisfied with that. In fact, I probably should have waken up earlier, since I work both jobs tomorrow night. And it starts to turn dark again. I cook some chicken nuggets and french fries, make some coffee, check my email. 3 She argued in the fashion that I imagine Oprah would, and I responded about the same. So many times she would open her mouth and what she said would sound like, “I hear your concerns and care about them. I think that you might feel better if you could see where I’m coming from, too. Is it okay if I explain to you some of how I’m feeling right now? It feels like you don’t care how I feel when you I tell you how I feel about the way you feel about the way I feel about the fact that you’re needy and whiny and that your presence in my life is too much of a responsibility when I’m just looking to have fun. ” To which my reply would be something the basic gist of which would be “I do understand where you’re coming from. I know that you deserve to have fun and I’m sorry if you’re in a position where your dedication to our relationship is interfering with your fun. I know that you only want to feel like you can suddenly stop talking to me, stop touching me, stop eating, talk about how miserable you are and how this is the point in a relationship where you start to sabotage it, imply that I’m being controlling of you if I ask for reassurance that you and our relationship are going to be okay even though you have been starting to wear yourself down and you’ve no longer been finding solace in talking and spending quality time with me, but rather you’ve only been finding solace in drinking on an empty stomach in the sort of nightclubs where, when I go, I am very nervous and you ignore me and around which, with regard to you, not to put too fine a point on it, I have reason to feel anxious. I know that I overreact to things, like the things you didn’t see fit to tell me about your past. And I know that you want someone who will empathize with your feelings in the way that I do but won’t respect you enough to be hurt by the way that you don’t respect the people you date. I know that I don’t make you feel like a woman—that I’m too effeminate for your tastes. I wish you would just break up with me, because I can’t bring myself to break up with you. ” Yeah, so, our arguments would feel a little something like that. Eventually, she did break up with me. 4 I woke up last night and realized that I was late for my overnight shift convenience-ing… although, at least I wasn’t terribly terribly so. As if to make myself feel less guilty about this, I slacked less than usual through the night. Except, I caused a bit of a scare in the morning when it was revealed that I had signed for some five thousand dollars worth of cigarettes which hadn’t actually been delivered. These were tracked down, fortunately. I’m throwing my life in a multitude of directions, hoping that in some place I’ll stick… but thus far, I’m just clinging to what I have, and barely. I spend hours writing cover letters—I’m such a great match, see all that I know about your company!—for places that won’t call me back. Temporary agencies speak to me in vague riddles such that I don’t even know whether I’ve completed the application process. Meanwhile, academic references vanish into thin air. I find myself wanting to go back to school some way, any way, anywhere. I go to offices and talk to people. I make phone calls. Consider finances. Consider scheduling. Consider careers. I keep looking for the back door. I’ve always needed to sneak in through the back door of any school—nay, any community. Any path. Any of my various fleeting identities. It feels like I have to hack into society, because no one would grant me admittance through the usual methods. The usual methods being, somebody sees your potential and pushes you to be the person society expects you to be. I’m so stupidly underemployed, it’s not even like being employed at all. If I were working M-F 9-5 at a crappy job, that’d be one thing. But I work Sunday 6PM-11:30PM, Tuesday 4PM-10PM, Thursday 11PM-6:30AM, Friday 4PM-8PM and then 11PM-6:30AM, Saturday 11PM-6:30AM. And you know, there’s lots of random stuff that I have to take care of during the day. And it’s not like I can sleep very soon after a shift. If somebody were holding me every night and wanting to talk to me about all the crap I have to keep straight in my mind to try and make things better for myself… then it would seem more worth it. I think then I wouldn’t get so insecure about my ability to get through. I thought I had someone who wouldn’t mind holding me when I was overwhelmed. Didn’t she say that she liked that? Didn’t she say, “It’s nice that you don’t push me away when you’re feeling upset”? I keep thinking of that random guy on C-SPAN who was saying that everybody finds a mentor; where the hell has he been not to see the evidence to the contrary? Comfortably hanging out with his mentors, I presume. I work at a convenience store; I know what happens to the mentorless. I serve poor customers who will lose hundreds of dollars over the course of twenty minutes through buying scratch tickets. These people are, of course, not entirely unlike myself. The problem with my current mindset is, I find myself thinking, “I would work myself to the bone… I would push my resilience to its limit… for years… for some true, honest shot at security. ” “Looking forward to the weekend?” a customer asked me. “Ah, see, I don’t have weekends,” I smiled. He laughed. “I don’t even really have… days, anymore. ” Which is true. Maybe I would feel better if I didn’t want to sleep sometimes. I hate the feeling that I’m killing myself, and I don’t even work 40 hours a week. I earn better wages than some—seventy-five cents per hour above minimum wage—but I’m in a constant state of emergency. All of my days center around trying to research how to continue to survive. I just get so afraid. Because I’m a loser. A pushover, a turn-the-other-cheek type of guy. And I know it. And so much of the time, I’m awake, when others are asleep. And I don’t want to go to work, and I’m supposed to leave now. 5 Lyric works with Alix, so while I was texting back and forth with her today I asked her what Alix’s schedule was… because, maybe we could meet up and I could hand over the post-breakup collection of stuff that had been left in my apartment and car. I was told to call after Alix was at work… and I did, and I talked to her, and she sounded so mean to me, I couldn’t stand it. She said that she would let me know what she was doing tonight. Later, she left me a voice mail when I was in the shower, making nonsensical explanations about why she couldn’t meet up with me and that maybe I could just drive to her work during her shift and leave the stuff there. I ignored the voice mail, because I was angry and didn’t want to go that far out of my way for someone who, during our relationship, I felt had taken me for granted. This was petty, but it was important for my own self-respect. I had asked Lyric what she was up to tonight, and I learned that she was supposed to hang out with Alix and another of Alix’s friends. I figured they probably wanted to go to the same place where I had wanted to go tonight. Realizing that this was a case of post-breakup drama that was putting people in the middle and making life complicated, I decided to show up there. And I acted casual, which for the most part wasn’t an act because, aside from Alix, I was among friends. There were points where I started to get emotional, but I was able not to let that show too much. Alix took me aside, though. She said, “It’s weird and I feel awkward, without having talked to you one-on-one and then to act casual…” We spoke candidly and civilly. She was the one who broke up with me, but still she seemed relieved that I was talking to her like a human being. Clearly, she had been waiting for me to get in touch. To still be friends. And I was explaining to her exactly how it was that I was needing time… …how I needed to claim my independence… …because I would be too inclined to keep feeling, emotionally, in love with her… …even if I wasn’t with her. Because I give too much, even if I’m not getting what I need. I was saying things along the lines of, I don’t feel like I’m entirely done with the process of getting over it yet, but I didn’t want things to feel so weird, and I want to deal with things maturely, and I don’t want to be unfair to our mutual friends, so that’s why I came here. And then I remember I was saying, “I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to… obstruct you…” when she started crying and ran away. I wanted to give her her space, then. I didn’t know what to do. But she came up to me and said, “I reacted that way because I hate myself for what happened. ” At the end of the night, I gave Alix her stuff. And drove Lyric home. Lyric said, “You say that you have to adjust to knowing that to her, you were just another relationship gone wrong. But you weren’t like her other relationships. ” “What do you mean?” I asked. “She doesn’t hate you. ” And she said, “She keeps asking me if you’re seeing anyone else. ” This surprised me. I figured, though, well, okay, if she’s asking these questions, I may as well: “Is she seeing anyone else?” “Not as far as I know,” Lyric said. “Ah, but you wouldn’t know. ” “No, I think I’d know. ” “Okay… but she’s sleeping with other people. ” “Again, not as far as I know. ” ”. …I’ve just been figuring that the best thing is not to think about what she could be doing with other people. ” “That’s probably a wise decision. ” And she said, “She’s just bad in relationships. She needs some time to be herself. ” “It’s just hard,” I said, “Because I was ready to make her family. ” “She is family. There’ve been times when I’ve just wanted to slap you and say, ‘Call her! You have to be in her life, somehow!’” 6 July 29, 2006. I’m having an emotional breakdown or something. 7 Montreal, Quebec. This far north and the weather still has been too hot for me. Amelia left me a voice mail on Monday while I was working at the convenience store—a busy, busy shift, but between customers I managed to listen to the message inviting me to ride with her up here for Wednesday and Thursday. As these are my days off this week, I agreed, happily. I replied with a text message: “Yes to Montreal”. 8 There has been too much happening recently. Too much work, that was the biggest thing. At the end of the month the lease on my apartment in Amherst will be up and I’ll need to be somewhere. I’m determined to at least be able to take one class this Fall. I’m looking for places to live in Northampton, although the smallness of this area overwhelms me and I would love to spend the year somewhere else. 9 I’ve never really been able to spend much time in Montreal before. I know that lots of people love the place. 10 I saw Alix again, soon after, briefly. She was with Lyric and Leigh in front of the Haymarket Café as I was going to get a cup of coffee before work. Everyone was awkward because they knew things I didn’t. Like the way she was getting some other lustful man excited about the opportunity to date her. When she didn’t like him at all, of course. She was just drunk that one night, at one of the parties that I was quietly not invited to, and she did another meaningless, stupid act, the same way that so much of what men have done to her has been meaningless to them. 11 Lyric had been visiting me during the overnight shifts at the convenience store. On Thursday night Alix wanted to come along with her. It was another night of everyone knowing things that I didn’t. “Now’s the best time to visit,” I text messaged Lyric, “Drag her over here now. ” They had gone to the 80s night at Diva’s Nightclub. It took them a long time after I messaged. 12 That night, I came over to Alix’s at six in the morning. She and Lyric looked dead tired, both lying down on the mattress in Alix’s apartment, into which she had still been moving basic furnishings. They were so cute, all bare legs and messed-up hair and horizontal, but with obvious detachment. Alix was strumming her acoustic guitar. Before long Lyric had left, leaving us a condom just in case. 13 Lyric and I had become closer friends since my and Alix’s break up. The two of them were spending a lot of time together, too. Alix, once she was interacting with me again, emphasized this point: “Lyric has been like a surrogate lover to me.  I’m sick of boys. ” 14 I am awake on about a half hour’s sleep. I’ve been sitting in front of this one coffee shop in Montreal for quite awhile now. I suppose I should walk and explore, although I could write for days right now, I think. 15 I definitely just ordered milk and cookies from a Tim Horton, without thinking about the fact that I was getting “milk and cookies” and that that’s kind of funny. Now I’m very tired and spacey. I always like about Canada that I can make so many purchases using only a two-dollar coin. 16 So then there was the time I was expecting to hang out with Lyric, but then Alix came by, while I was working at the convenience store, and she said that she was planning to hang out with Lyric and Leigh at her place. So that was what we were doing—though, I was really in the mood to go out and not to start worrying about Alix and what the two of us were becoming again, since I had been doing so much to accept intellectually that she wasn’t ready for a relationship, that she shouldn’t be in a relationship. So I thought of skipping out, but instead I showed up and had a good time, chatting on the outside porch and in the kitchen. I noticed that I was being accepted in the company of “girl talk”, which in this case involved the three of them relating what had been some of the more horrifying situations that had happened in their lives involving men when they were younger. 17 Amelia has mostly been running about conducting her business here in Montreal while I’ve been left to wander and entertain myself. Which I really don’t mind, at least so long as it’s light out, which it still is. She attended an orientation session for Concordia University (which, to walk through, at least this one building, looks like ten or so high schools piled on top of each other and connected by frequently broken escalators). Now she’s meeting with potential apartment-mates. I stop writing, plan to sit inside the shopping mall once I’ve finished my cigarette. A man comes and sits next to me. I infer that he wants a cigarette, although I can’t understand what he’s saying. I hand him a cigarette and a lighter to use for it. He’s speaking, but I don’t understand a word. “I’m sorry,” I say, “My French isn’t very good. ” I can understand some of what he says then in English, but only roughly through his accent. He asks me where I’m from.  Massachusetts, I tell him. He says that he’s Muslim and that the United States hates people like him. He says that the United States is doing wrong. He says, “We don’t want war. ” He says that the United States has done right before. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, he says, and the United States entered that war and that was right. His father, he says, saw American soldiers, when Japan was bombing India and the American soldiers came then. Then, he says, that was good. I tell him that I often disagree with my government’s policies. “My interest in the United States,” I say, “Is that it’s where I was born, and where my family and friends are. ” He wonders why I’m in Canada. I say that I’m visiting, but he either doesn’t understand or doesn’t believe me. He asks, “You don’t hate me?” I say that I don’t. He talks about Israel and Egypt. He talks about U. S. history as if hoping to teach it to me: how the United States gained Alaska, Louisiana, California. He says that since Nixon the presidents have not been doing good things. He says that Canada is a peaceful country, explains their medical care. He says that he has family in New York, they drive taxi cabs, but he prefers to stay in Canada. When I tell the man, after perhaps forty-five minutes, that I want to go to find my friend, who is taking longer than expected, he tells me where the local shelters are and which of them permit smoking. 18 Alix and I walked inside from the porch. Our conversation was too loud, really, to be acceptable outside. Lyric and Leigh didn’t immediately follow, and my and Alix’s talking quickly became about “us” and what we “were” despite my (and, I think, Alix’s) attempts at avoiding too much grave conversation. We’ve made the mistakes before, biting each other’s heads off, and even when we don’t do that we end up spending so much energy on discussions. It always ended up seeming like we were a threat to each other—a threat to each other’s identities, although it also feels like we’re both the same person. "

    "body": "19 Nightfall in French Canada. The Montreal inside my head used to always be night. “I’m not going to want to come back,” I predicted to Amelia while she drove us on the highway up there through Vermont, “I’m already sad that I’m going to have to come back. ” Now Amelia is saying on the phone to me that it took her longer than expected to find the apartment she was to see: she’d gotten lost on the Metro again. I don’t understand what could be so confusing about riding the Metro, but I plan for these sorts of mishaps when I tag along with Amelia. She’s smart, and she has more to say about things like literature than a lot of folks I know (she’s a child of academic types), but she’s also scatterbrained. 20 Ever since getting the DVDs of the first season of The Muppet Show and listening to some the analysis of Kermit’s character on the commentary track, I’ve been thinking of myself as a sort of real life Kermit the Frog—surrounding myself with chaos and then battling it, always just barely able to keep my situations from falling apart entirely. 21 It takes us well over an hour to find where the car is parked. With Montreal being ill-equipped for hot weather, I have been sweating all day, still carrying a bag full of clothes and other travel items. Neither Amelia nor I speak French well, although both of us can try. She always tries before I do, with an enthusiasm and humor that is probably lost in translation. In one of the parking lots, where we believe that we may or may not have left the car, a security guard approaches. After we’ve had some trouble understanding him he asks, “Do you speak French?” “Non,” says Amelia. “Do you speak English?”—this one rudely. “Oui,” says Amelia, languages still crossed in her mind, “Uh, si. I mean, yes! We do. ” I feel that we are stupid Americans. Not able to understand how to use a parking garage? After finally reclaiming the car, our next step is to find the motel where we’ll be staying. Amelia drives; I try to help navigate. We turn a corner and stop at a green light. A man in a suit with a briefcase who is waiting to cross the street assumes a neutral stance and screams, in clear English well-enunciated, “Why don’t you go back to your own country, you stupid… FUCKING… IDIOTS!” Amelia is meanwhile looking down and consulting our map. When I mention this man, she doesn’t seem to entertain the possibility that he had been referring to us. 22 What Leigh was doing was talking to Lyric about Joe. Lyric had been text messaging me a lot lately about her attempts to contact this recent ex-boyfriend, or about times when she doesn’t make attempts but still wants to. 23 “The room kind of smells funny,” says Amelia as we enter. Soon she applies something or other to her feet, which are cut and blistered. We decide that the best plan for the night is to buy some beer, then have a pizza delivered to our room. She has changed into pink shorts and an orange shirt—appropriate for sleeping, but not inappropriate to wear outside. She looks at herself in the mirror and says, “I’ve been concerned about my boobs. ” She examines her profile and pushes up her breasts: “I used to wear a bra, but then I stopped, and now it seems they’re not as pretty as they used to be. ” She is thin with short, disheveled hair. I have noticed during this trip that the summer has brought out her freckles. She adds, “I also have what looks like stretch marks, though that doesn’t make sense. I’ve gained and lost weight, but not more than like ten pounds. You can see them in the mirror. ” “Well, I can’t see them,” I said, “For what that’s worth. ” 24 Lyric thought that my co-worker Dan was cute, so after Leigh left, and after I mentioned that he was currently working the overnight shift, Lyric disappeared into the bathroom to pretty herself up. Two bottles of wine had been split between the four of us that night, and Alix and I had recently finished the last of it. “Oh, wow,” said Alix when Lyric had emerged, ready to flirt with the convenience store clerk. “How do I look?” asked Lyric. “You look amazing,” said Alix. “Hot,” I said. “It’s the hair,” added Alix, “You should let your hair down like that more often. ” 25 At the gas station, Amelia and I consider which beer to buy. I say that the choice is up to her. One of the clerks closes off the barrier that is placed around alcoholic beverages when it is too late in the night for them to be sold. He pretends to be locking us in. I push the barrier back open. “Don’t worry,” he says, “I’m a joker. I’m only fooling around. ” “Is it too late for us to buy, anymore?” “No,” he says, “You can still buy. You just have to decide within the next thirty seconds or so. ” He was being silly. I thought at first that he was being rude. “Sorry if I looked scared,” I say, “It’s been a long day. ” We purchase some Brazilian beer and go back to our room. 26 I think because Amelia and I are both so tired, the beer gets to us pretty easily despite its having a low alcohol content. We’re excited when the pizza is delivered. “I’m glad you decided to go with actual Montreal pizza, instead of Pizza Hut,” she says, “Which reminds me, did you notice when we were driving…” “Boston Pizza? Yeah, you mentioned that. ” “I never thought of Boston as a place that was known for having good pizza. ” We don’t quite finish the six pack of beer. She turns on the TV and hops onto the bed. I’m on the bed, too. She is drunk and running out of things to say. I close my eyes and roll over. 27 Aug. 26, 2006. I had the right idea about Alix after our first falling out, about two years ago… and still when, after that, we started to be friends again. I hadn’t forgotten yet that she was the sort of person who would maliciously hurt a friend and break all promises to them so long as she could figure out a way to argue that that person had provoked it. I saw her as charming, intelligent, highly capable of adapting to new lifestyles, but a ticking time bomb for anyone who came too close. Fortunately, my identity had been blown to bits a million times before, so I was used to having to rebuild it. I think the fact that she could do that, too—rebuild her identity at a moment’s notice—was one of the reasons we respected each other so much, for so long. Not many people have that talent, which we shared, and which kept us from ever really devastating each other. We could always rebuild ourselves, so there was only so much to fear. This lasted until we wanted to build a life together. Then our foundations just kept getting blown to bits, too. Honestly, I think we grew aggravated and desperate, trying to find each other in the rubble of our attempted relationships. 28 Sept. 9. I think the most painful part is gradually coming to terms with the fact that what I said to myself after it happened, just to make myself feel better, is entirely true. And that I really am such gullible person. When I see her, and she tries to hurt me… because she just wants me out of her life, and doesn’t want to run into me anywhere… the actions themselves are meaningless. In the moment, when she does something to spite me, I just roll my eyes. But the greater implications… how she can be moved to do these things at all… when I wouldn’t be able to bring myself to hurt her in the same ways… it’s terrible. Bit by bit, the woman she had convinced me she was falls apart. And the scared, superficial girl, who would destroy a lover before she would let herself care for him in any consistent, genuine way… is all that’s left for me to see in her. 29 Oct. 8. I wonder what I should eat this morning. I don’t know. This is too difficult to decide. Too difficult to decide what to eat. What do I eat? I wish that someone would decide for me. What is there here that I like to eat? I’m hungry. Should I eat first? Have coffee first? I don’t know. What should I do? It’s all too difficult! 30 Oct. 27. Sleeping the wrong way again. I hate when I do that. And those dreams about familiar places, although they’re not actually places. I don’t hate them. Dream-people were both annoying to be sitting next to and new and lovely. One tried squeezing my hand too hard, until her arm fell off. I was thinking of getting a job, in the dream. A job I used to have, in the dream. So nice to be there again… or maybe I would work in a different department. 31 Nov. 7. Waking up at two-something in the morning after maybe 4 hours of sleep, not able to fall back to sleep, I drive around, lonely and embarrassed for myself and confused, not able to make much sense out of anything. 32 Nov. 8. According to exit polls, 40% of American voters think that “life will be worse for the next generation”. (AP) 33 Dec. 11, 2016. I look at a photograph knowing that the camera, the eye was I to you.   Here is a perspective of you, light sullied when it touches there and bounces off like little podlets.   I moralized and hoped for you to be vain, beneficiary, to make love in the ranks, to never mind the bullocks.   You don’t have to steal anymore, I was hoping to say. But I guess a hustler never settles for a wage.   You ran off with this photograph, pimped your likeness to the loving, trusting few.   I have to go to see them and apologize for you. 34 Dec. 15. I am again delivering pizzas and again working at a convenience store (now in a different town). Overnights are very slow, so I’m basically being paid to slowly ruminate the new Pynchon novel, Against the Day. (300 pages down, 800 to go!) 35 Dec. 16. An elderly man called me a motherfucker today. I ignored him. A phone pervert yelled, “Why won’t you tell me if the cover model is a blonde or a fucking brunette!” and I hung up on him. 36 Dec. 19. “Well,” I say to Daisy, “You seem to be talking less about how you’re a terrible person than you did when I met you. ” “Ha. Yeah,” she says, “That’s how I try to make friends. ” Nighttime on a front porch. There aren’t a lot of smokers at Britta’s party tonight. Ella joins us. Filling her in on where our conversation was: “Do you have moments, sometimes, where you’re happy?” “Hm,” she says. Silence, thoughtful, thinking about it. “Hm. ” 37 I had to leave that party early: I’m at the convenience store for the overnight, working at the Cumberland Farms in Granby now, on the phone. Discussing rattlesnakes and coyotes. The house she’s looking to live in: “I’m ballin’!” She, Marie, the old friend, living now in Arizona and working for a bank. She hears my transactions when I put the phone down. “Wow,” she says, “That one sounded like an asshole. ” She doesn’t hear the woman who jumps for joy when she finds that the store is open—”I love you!”—comes in looking for something else, and when we don’t have it, assures me, “Don’t worry, I still love you!” 38 “Yeah,” says Dan at the Cumberland Farms in Northampton, after I’ve poured my coffee, when I happen to stop in late in his shift. He’s changing the trashes and saying, “This woman called and was asking me questions about dog food, and I was just telling her, I don’t know what she should feed her dog, so I really can’t make a recommendation, because I really don’t know, and she kept me on the phone asking questions, and I said, like, I’m not the person you should be asking, you should wait until you can ask at a pet store or something, and then she started saying how she appreciated my honesty and we should get together and watch the sunrise? So I said yes. So I may have a crazy woman coming in this morning for a date…” "

    "body": "39 Jan. 1, 2007. That was a very long year, but I hardly wrote about any of it. 40 Jan. 14. Thursday, convenience store, working during the day, which I detest doing and will not do anymore. Only overnights for me; they’re easier and less aggravating and I get to read. The days make me grouchy. A woman comes to the register. I’m thinking unusually bitter things as I ring her up: Yes, sure, throw away your money on a bunch of crappy purposeless novelty items. Oh, I see that you’ll be redeeming some lottery tickets. And then you’ll be spending whatever you earn on more tickets, of course. I’m scanning her novelty items. She starts to say, “I need…” and I think, Oh, yes, I’m sure you “need” whatever you’re about to ask me for. Then she stops and says, “…Levi?” I look up and say “Oh, hi,” to be polite. Force of habit: I don’t recognize most of the people who recognize me. I understand who she is immediately, but my brain has to go through a process in order to assure itself that it’s not insane. I need to look at her about four times, scan her lottery tickets and ask her if she wants anything else before I accept the fact that it’s Brielle, my ex from seven years ago, now thirty years old. “I didn’t recognize you at first,” she says. I’ve been wanting to catch up with her, to see how she’s doing, for years now; but now that she’s in front of me, after so long, I find myself acting just as I would if I loathed her. But as she turns to leave I blurt out something honest like, “I hope you’re doing well. ” She turns back around at the door and says, “It was good to see you again. ” Then I say, “Yeah, you too. ” And she walks back out to her car. 41 Jan. 17. Karaoke. I never much enjoyed karaoke for itself. The first time I remember going to a karaoke night, I was holding hands with Katie, just after we first met. (One of those people, it’s hard to think that we dated at all, that she pointed me out to our mutual acquaintance and he said, “I know him, you should talk to him, let me introduce you”… that she took me to a pond and we stared at the water. I remember looking up to her, feeling so lucky to be one-on-one with someone so smart, well-spoken and confident. Waiting for her to inevitably, quickly move on. She did, but we were friends at least, housemates for a year. I remember her better that way, her using my computer to email professors. Sitting on our front steps, her talking about grading papers for the course that she was TAing. Putting me in my place, maybe during a party, when I would say something disparaging about movies in general. ) I would occasionally go to that same karaoke night, off and on, through the years. For some reason, a moment I remember is when I sang a duet of “Feed the Tree” with Tina… (…who astonishes me still when she’ll introduce me like this: “He’s the reason I came to the Valley. I met him on the Internet and I came to visit him and we fell madly in love and it didn’t last for long, but I loved it here and never went home. Well, I went back home a couple of times—never for too long—but my heart was in the Valley from then on. Pretty much I’ve been in the Valley ever since, and that was something like five years ago. ”) Then, my first semester at UMass, weekly trips to West Hartford for karaoke with a crowd including Julian, who would sing “Friday I’m in Love” and tell me that it was for me and play with my hair or hold my head tightly between his hands while licking my lips, somebody singing “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” or “My Way” as a backdrop, while his primary partner stayed at home and slept. For Alix it was always “drunken karaoke”, never just “karaoke”. She would sing “Down by the Water” or “Angry Johnny”, but so softly that you couldn’t hear. I saw her there mostly after we had broken up. She, I, Lyric, Leigh, and maybe Daniel would be dancing to “Hips Don’t Lie” or “Gold Digger”, the top 40 songs played between karaoke numbers. Spending blocks of time by myself, I would maybe strike up conversation with a Smith College student, whose friend would then walk up and ask, “Is everything cool?” looking at me, and the girl I would be talking to would say, “Oh, yeah, it’s fine” and I would just be alternating between small talk and silly questions about the meaning of life, forgetting her name anyway. A guy would engage me in conversation until he would discover that I was bisexual, and then he would laugh and walk away. Or I would sit at the bar and talk to a thirtysomething man while he bitterly complained that so many of the girls around here are queer that you don’t know who you can go up to, to ask if you can buy them a drink. Technically it’s a private club, making it one of the few bars where smoking is still allowed, so the smoke would be increasing as the night progressed, while everybody was also getting more drunk. Alix might have told me how little she had eaten that day; Lyric might have talked about Daniel and how that relationship was going. Last Wednesday, having to decide where to go, I take Julian out to Diva’s, knowing that there’s karaoke. What I don’t know is that it’s also a drag show night, popular enough to command a $7 cover charge. I pay for myself, for Julian, and also for Salma when she arrives. Julian is taking part in the karaoke competition. I’m at a table in the other room with Salma and we’re talking about I don’t even know what. We can always talk and talk and talk. Presumably it starts on her boyfriend, Johnny… then the conversation brightens and we’re laughing… then it gets serious again and she’s speculating about what she should do with her life. She has never seen a drag show before—we’re heading outside to the porch so that we can share a clove and she sees a queen dancing and her eyes open wide and she’s like, “Can we watch some!” and I laugh, “Of course” and we watch. I don’t mention that I usually find drag shows to be sort of boring, because then she would say oh, we don’t have to. I enjoy watching her smile. We watch Julian sing “Hallelujah” under spinning colored lighting effects, eyes closed facing the audience, awesome. He loses to the only other contestant, but still he will be welcomed back the next week for another round of the competition or something, I don’t know. With Julian in the front passenger’s seat, Salma in the back, we sit in the parking lot and read to each other from an anthology of modern poetry. I drive to Salma’s car. Out on the street is our goodbye hug, which knocks us down. We fall, me on top of her. In the moment I might have seen a guilty romance in this, if I hadn’t been too busy thinking, Holy shit Levi don’t crack her head open on the pavement… trying to cushion the fall with my arm and hand… but she is only laughing. She says, That was wonderful. We spend fifteen minutes in the street, talking into each other’s hair. She doesn’t respond to my text messages for a week afterward. This isn’t out of the ordinary. Julian is half asleep in the car. I drive him back to Sunderland, where he lives with his fiancé. Monday, Julian and I are again at a karaoke night, this time at Packards. As usual, I invite Salma along via text message but she doesn’t respond. I have a cold, but I sing, and unlike most of my attempts these past couple years or so, I enjoy myself. There is something about karaoke that for a long time I never enjoyed. Performing my own material, or playing my own instrumentation, that was amazing… but karaoke seemed strange. It bothered me that my voice could only complement somebody else’s arrangement… that I had no say in the tempo, let alone the satisfaction of producing the music myself. It kept me from being comfortable. I would try to sing outside my range; my voice would crack and waver and sometimes fall silent… but I’m beginning to learn my range now. If there’s a song that I want to sing, I can always adapt it, sing it within a different octave… and there’s something original in that, I suppose. 42 After graduating from college, mistakenly thinking myself in a serious relationship and being proven wrong, I move back home. Sleeping in a pink-framed bed, the head of which bears the name of my fifteen-year-old step-sister, who lives (except for on certain holidays) in Florida. I work at a convenience store, there by myself selling lottery tickets… also delivering pizzas to the Air Force base, to the strip club, to my little cousin when he’s over his friend’s house playing video games, to deteriorating apartment complexes where McDonald’s wrappers roll about in the wind and the kids play catch and on one door is a poem by Langston Hughes… my fellow driver railing against liberal causes and candidates, trying to offend me because he knows that the car I drive gets good gas mileage and so he infers that I must be both a Democrat and easily offended… and I set the alarm, roll out of that pink bed and substitute teach for kids out in the sticks, where the problem students are more docile than any student at all where I come from, and the kids give me a confused look when they learn that I didn’t attend school there, the aides wander off to I don’t know where and the students follow into the hallways so that the classroom is then completely empty and I am alone to think of what a terrible teacher I am and to wonder in that case what the hell else I can hope to do with my life that will pay the bills, and the lesson plan says, This student will probably be tired, This student can do the enclosed crossword puzzle. Meanwhile I’m taking a grad course in literature at UMass as a non-degree student. People there are laughing, talking about youth spent obsessed with famous poets, a professor’s agenda, tense disagreements, citation. I’m wearing ratty old clothes from Christmases past, trying to wake up for office hours and then when I go the professor is not there of course, innocent eager faces, working on Ph. D. s, sometimes M. F. A. s, I could have been elsewhere doing that myself, I guess, except I turned one not at all exciting offer down and didn’t make it into any of the programs that I really wanted to go to, so I’ll try for the next academic year here and there, my portfolio now better anyway, and I have other options too, sensible ones, will try for everything, see what sticks, until then I figure just don’t talk about it to anyone, they’ll see everything in terms of success or failure rather than what it really is, a pursuit of happiness. My mom keeps cooking for pay, step-father lifting cargo and driving freight, I haven’t seen my father-father in years… I work at a different convenience store, see the same customers all the time… I don’t want to have a gun to my head (although the downtime behind the counter is nice) so I buy The Republican for the Careers section… singing karaoke… my laptop’s broken, still under warranty, a month and I still don’t have it back, wake up in the morning and immediately I’m in my car, get a coffee and just drive… too awkward to hang out at my friends’ places, either their partner or their roommate, there’s always something awkward, so instead we’ll just go out and dance, talk until sunrise, the car idling but there’s an exhaust leak, should let the window down a crack… faces on the street and their addictions… men use women so women use men so… “solidarity”… I think, No dates, no Giving yourself to me… let’s talk about you, Levi, for a change, and let’s be friends forever and I say yes, yes, but what is there to say about myself until you tell me what I am to you? And it’s just me talking with myself, or doing what would have been understood as me talking to myself to people of previous generations, and that familiar voice says there’s nothing more for me in Massachusetts, that I need to leave by any means necessary, that I should pretend it’s 1998 or 1999 again and just go, go. Well, okay, then! Don’t have to tell me twice when that’s what you’re asking. But if there really is someone who knows what would happen to me without intervention, someone, as we say, from an unspecified point in the future, if they know some version of me that has played out they must have read some version of me, right? And it’s not that I expect you to answer, Reader, but where we don’t yet have the science the best yet we can do is use the magic we have, ‘cause I missed you, yeah, when I stopped posting everything to the Internet, and I found that I didn’t believe in you and so I didn’t want to look at myself. I’m going to have to find a way to make the way survive the day, to make it to you, Reader, you in the distant future, who in this permutation are not my angel, because I said goodbye to that permutation when the angel arrived, so even the angel that was commissioned to nudge the trajectory of my life doesn’t have a way of knowing you, do they, Reader? Now that I am leaving, now I know that I did something right in this furtive escape, this magic reality fantasy novel, Reader, and it’s just for me and you, wink, for the Brontë-esque, wink, just, for me and you. So, I’m moving to Philadelphia! I have no idea what that’s going to look like, but it’s happening, yay! "

    "body": "1 Mar. 11, 2007. I’m not a regular, but I’m memorable. The bartender is picking up the glasses from the eight or so of us who have squeezed around one of the tables. Finds out I’m leaving town, says my next drink is on the house. I’ve been an anxious mess all day because I didn’t want this. I didn’t want this gathering. I’m such a jerk! I had just wanted to sneak away, to move suddenly. The people who needed to know were going to know: one-on-one time with various friends, as I’ve been doing, but no going-away party, nothing like this. I especially didn’t want to have friends watching me around Julian, who already has been gushing to everyone about how he’s in love with me. Never mind his already being engaged! I’m so frustrated by this feeling. I’ve encountered it before and it’s scary. And alienating. When there’s nobody left to confide in—small town, everybody’s heard the other side of the story. I’m too slow to confide; I’m too tentative with everything. Not that there’s much of a story: he just thinks I’m an angel. Maybe that’s a recurring theme. Tonight, standing outside the bar, cigarette-smoking, arms linked with Salma, my head on Daisy’s shoulder. “He’s an angel,” the former advises the latter. Didn’t I write a song about this?: “I heard the voices, they were calling me ‘angel’. ” I just wanted to sneak away from this town, but the news has made three people cry. And Daisy tonight for her goodbye—I never really got to know her—told me, “I could have been in love with you. ” And a momentary lip-kiss. The other day, when I met Britta for coffee, the topic was raised: “Yeah,” she asked, “Who are you close to? I don’t even know…” and I just looked at her like finally, someone is asking that question! 2 “You don’t mind if Bruce drives you to the bus station, do you?” asks my mother. “I want to take a shower. ” “No, that’s fine,” I say. Outside the bus station, Bruce says, “I love you, kid. ” I’m half-asleep and paranoid, then. The same old birds are pecking. A Dr. Pepper bottle is squeezed between the seat and the side of the bus. Then I’m feeling better. “This is the local schedule to New York City. ” Departing Springfield. Baby crying. Jury pool parking three dollars. My mother calls? Not really supposed to use phones on the bus, I turn off the phone, wonder what she wants. She’s left a voice mail saying that I received a letter from the University of North Texas. I already know that they accepted me into their M. A. Writing program. I never had any desire to move to Texas, although I might still have accepted an offer if the pieces had fallen differently. I’ve taken with me two duffel bags and a plastic shopping bag. The shopping bag rips by the time I’m in New York. Hi, New York. Hi, Port Authority. I buy an issue of Rolling Stone so that I don’t have to beg for a free plastic bag. This replacement plastic then immediately rips. I walk a few steps; things are slipping out of my hands. I plop everything down and pick it up again. Repeat this over and over. Then I realize that I am not walking in this direction for any particular reason. I ask at the information desk and then I’m like, Oh yeah. The gate I’m looking for is where it has always been. I walk across the street from the bus terminal in Philly to where I’m going to catch the rail. It won’t come for another fifty minutes and so I go to a pub, sit at the bar. I slept maybe two and a half hours last night, maybe twenty minutes on the bus; now I’m reading a sentence by Don DeLillo: I took this as a sign that he was warming up to speak. I wanted to bolt, make off suddenly, run. The man who had asked “Is anybody sitting here?” I notice nudging his stool over. I’m sitting and drinking a cola, having finished my water. I was going to finish reading the chapter, but this guy in the corner of my eye is making me want to leave immediately. As I’m about to go he finally asks: “Where are you in town from?” “Massachusetts,” I say. Where we’re assholes, I think to myself. I leave and go back to wait for the train. Alice and Franklin are watching the first episode of the series The Riches and both are clutching their cell phones, texting. The episode runs again. Franklin goes to bed. Something else is on television. I’m asleep before long. The next morning, Franklin’s mother is taking Alice and baby P. to the supermarket. I’m still asleep, mostly. They leave. I walk to the Wawa convenience store and buy a coffee. They return as I’ve picked out a change of clothes. I’ve found my toothbrush and my hairbrush and my razors. I clean up. I walk a ways until I get to Panera Bread, where I get a coffee and open my laptop. But their wireless is down, ugh. Waiting for the train, I call my own mother, tell her that I arrived safely and whatnot. I ride to University City and walk through the Penn campus. The only place I find that has wireless is Cereality, the cereal bar. My mother calls again to tell me that I was accepted into the M. A. in Writing program at Johns Hopkins. Using the Internet, I apply to a job at a call center and also to something else, I forget. I’m listening to music and walking until I get lost until I realize that I know exactly where I am after all. I walk through Drexel University. Students play soccer and volleyball on the designated courts. I’m happy. I go into CVS and ask whether they’re hiring. Yes, replies the employee who has been standing in one of the aisles, who is failing to look busy. He says that I should apply at the company web site. I say that I already did. I should call on Monday and ask to speak with so-and-so. Not that I really want to work at CVS. I take the train again. I go to Panera Bread again. The wireless doesn’t work again. I get back to the apartment. We watch the show Dirt—twice—and then the first episode of The Riches for a third time. At various points P. is crying and neither of her parents can soothe her. Alice and Franklin go to bed. I watch The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, reading during the commercials. The next day, the weather is beautiful. I hear that it’s also beautiful in Massachusetts. We all walk to the train, go into the city, walk to South Street. We look inside a couple of stores. P. gets cranky. Franklin is on his phone, frustrated about problems with a show that’s being put together, Bella Morte and a bunch of other bands. Back to the Morton station. I take my leave to try Panera Bread again. This time the wireless network is functioning. I head back to the apartment once they’ve closed. I am very happy. Peeling off my socks, I request that we watch the new episode of South Park. Then the television stays on. I alternate between watching it and reading Proust. On Thursday I wake up later than I would have expected to wake up. I go to Panera Bread again and use the internet for several hours. It’s raining by the time I leave. I ask Borders if they’re hiring, having already applied there online. I’m referred to the manager, who says that they don’t need anyone but that if I write down my name for her, she’ll “keep me in mind”. I do as I’m instructed, then I walk back to the apartment. Over the course of my being awake I find myself sneezing and my nose running more and more. I finish reading White Noise. P. has a grumpy day. It takes Franklin awhile to get home after a long night of work, because the driving conditions are poor. Friday, we are essentially snowed in. Saturday, I take the train again to Market East and walk again to South Street. This time on my own, I have my eyes open for “Help Wanted” signs. One place looking for help is Condom Kingdom; I decide that I’ll go in, have a look around and then apply. While I’m inside, one of the employees calls out, “Does anyone want a job? Is anyone over eighteen who is looking for a job?” I walk up to him and say, “I am!” so he hands me an application. “What does it take to work at Condom Kingdom?” I ask. “Basic customer service, cash handling,” he says, “And not being stupid. You don’t do drugs, do you?” “No, I do not,” I tell him. I hand him the completed application. He says that he’ll put my application in the manager’s folder and that if I don’t hear anything within a week or so to give a call or stop in. I continue to feel happy as I walk the streets. I have several other possible job leads. I fall asleep early, then wake up early on Sunday. I go to Panera Bread just as they’re opening and I sit around for a few hours, using the Internet and going over the job listings in the newspaper that I’ve bought. For lunch I eat half of a ten inch hoagie bought at the Wawa, then I realize that I’m already full and I stick the rest in the fridge. I edit writings while Alice, Franklin and P. are visiting at Franklin’s parents’ place. I start to think again about what was happening to me in Massachusetts. The cloudiness of the brain that I was feeling. (Telling Julian that I was leaving… he cried and soon after, started talking about visiting me: “How often, ideally, would you like for me to visit you down there?” I started responding less consistently to his text messages. ) I start thinking I want to accept the offer at Johns Hopkins. Around 8:30, I get out the other half of that hoagie. In Massachusetts, we called them “grinders”. Gunshots on the television. Common. This is the next night, when I think this. Baby crying, I’m on the pulled-down futon. I’ve been here for a week now. Gunshots surrounding us, gunshots from imaginary life, television programs with gunshots. Today I again wandered Philly, where people hold doors for you but it’s dangerous for a big city. Now I’m thinking of Baltimore, where Johns Hopkins is. Violence there. In my life still the violence is mostly on television, in the background, and I take happiness from my ability to walk through it all to the fridge to get some water, to refill the Brita filter, or to scrape the Ellio’s pizza from the pan after it’s done cooking. Noise. There is noise, yes, but freedom is loud and annoying and astonishing like a crying child. I interview for a Petsmart that’s opening. The interview is for a position teaching “pet parents” how to train their pets. Part of the job, I gather, is also is to wander around the store doing this and that. I figure I’m pretty much hired as soon as they get the results from my pee test. I am hired. I’m told to visit the store on Monday to do paperwork. I see Bella Morte at the Trocadero. Franklin was somehow involved in setting up the show. Alone, I find my way from the backstage to the rest of the venue. Attendance is disappointing. Drinks are expensive, and although I didn’t pay to get in, at $5. 50 per cup of beer, during the show I can only justify to myself buying one drink. After, in the area of the second stage upstairs, music is playing and goths are socializing. I sit texting and IMing on my cell phone. Franklin texts me: “This is terrible”. I was attempting not to look annoyed or anything, being grateful for having been taken out and all. In a dream I’m working at someplace in Philadelphia, but it’s also a city in the Middle East, but all the while it’s definitely America. There is an emergency situation. The technology of the city is keeping a disaster at bay? It is as if reality itself is disintegrating, but there is something built into the city’s infrastructure that keeps everything within together. My supervisor at work whispers to me that she’s leaving so that she can get the hell out before everything falls apart. I tell her that it’s been nice working with her. I tell this to some other people, too, who are confused to see me leaving and who are also, it seems, a little bit hurt, because they can tell that I’m not coming back. I run a mostly-sheltered path, some of it inside, some of it outside. My shoes are floating in the air, following me. This is technology as well: my shoes chase after me so that I won’t lose them. Maybe it’s because I’m feeling a bit paranoid, but I want to outrun them. I do so. I reach Baltimore City, although it is also some other city completely, although it is also a university. A student there asks me what I’m doing and I say that I’m going to be starting school there. They kind of laugh, wondering why I would be a student at my age, or something. Some of the faculty see me and recognize me, remembering me from some other time. I share a knowing look with them. How do I expect to find anywhere to live in Delaware County when I only plan to stick around for five months? Maybe I should just move to Baltimore now, take my first class in the Summer instead of Fall. Or should I go to Hopkins at all? Whenever I’m employed, I feel like I’m barely employed—that I’m getting away with something, something that could be taken away at any moment. Of course I would love to be studying and writing around other people who are studying and writing, but there is the employment issue to consider. Stressed, I’m outside, smoking a cigarette. Franklin is emerging from his office. “How was your day?” he asks. “Eh, I’ve had better. I’m just stressing out,” I say, something along those lines. He says, “Yeah? I’ll be right back, I’m going to grab a smoke. ” I start talking about all that I’m considering—work, transportation, living arrangements, roommates, leases, sublets, what cities do I live in and when. My brain is in Craigslist-land and I’m angsting to myself that at the end of the day, I feel only slightly more employable than a felon with a drug habit. I’m expecting him to offer me advice on the logistical questions, which are all that I’m mentioning, but he surprises me: he starts talking about being an artist. He says that you just have to do it—just let things work themselves out. When I think of the phrase “just let things work themselves out” I think of what someone once said to me about their boyfriend: “When it seems to him that things are ‘just working themselves out’ it’s really other people working things out for him. ” But even that association in my brain doesn’t stop me from finding an appeal in what Franklin, the photographer and college instructor, is saying. The next night, I find a certain place on the futon where, if I sit with my laptop, I can connect to somebody’s wireless network. I download a leak of the new Bright Eyes album, Cassadaga. I walk around the suburbs listening to it. From this point on, I no longer feel that I have to spend all my days at Panera Bread. 3 “WELCOME TO ART,” read the letters on the wall. The man moves the ladder a bit to the left, from right to left placing the letters that spell “Petsmart”. My first task this morning was to remove out of cardboard boxes little aquarium rocks with little aquarium trees, to hose them down a little and to leave them drying in shopping carts. I, along with other trainees, was given a ride to another store, one that’s actually open to the public. There, it was just me and this other kid who were going through the training booklet and its endless worksheets. We wandered through the aisles, getting to know the merchandise, writing down the answers to the questions. We didn’t finish. After lunch, a whole group of us are working through the hundreds of little cards that have the names, pictures and SKU numbers of the different fishes for sale. Printouts tell us which fishes go in which tank. When we match a card to its tank, we put it into the plastic clip and place it on the tank. Six or seven of us work on this project for about three hours. Our method is not efficient. We don’t finish. “So you were hired as a Pet Training Instructor? Do you have experience with that?” asks a co-worker. “No,” I say, “It’ll be my first time doing this sort of thing. ” “Are you ready to get bitten?” “Um, no. ” “Remember to ask people if their dog is aggressive. Although a lot of times, they’ll lie and say no. ” My wait for the bus is long. The wind is cold. I’m reading, standing there at the curb of a three-lane street in the suburbs. A bank across the street, a couple of strip malls in sight. Around the corner and many feet down, the highway cuts through. After taking the bus back I find Alice singing “The Itsy Bitsy Spider” to calm down P. . I take over singing, singing it deeply and loudly. P. is smiling and staring at me as I talk about to Alice how my day was, about the guy who was coughing every two seconds who had sat next to me on the bus. The cat, Marquis de Sade, meows. I nuzzle his face. On the futon I sleep through the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. The last month’s rent for the sublet I’m looking at in University City can’t be negotiated, an email says. I can still manage it, I know. It’ll just be tight. 4 My second day at this job, I spend a long time using my fingernails to scrape off remnants of stickers from plastic hamster wheels. 5 Tickets having sold out for the VNV Nation concert, Franklin convinces organizer/promoter/person Joanna (whom I’ve never met) to let me in. “Just so you know,” he tells me, “You’ve been promoting for tonight. ” When she shows up, I’m handed fliers: “Here’s the deal. When the show’s over, you’re flyering for the after-party. ” But when the show is over, I’ve handed out two and Franklin has handed out none when she says to him, “You don’t really have to flyer if you don’t want to. ” Franklin throws his handful back into the box and seconds later we’re ready to go to Shampoo. Franklin and Alice and a friend of theirs stand around in the room dedicated to the after-party. The other two rooms of the club are for Shaft, a gay night. I hang out there instead and dance to pop music, watch the gyrating men onstage in g-strings, and buy a drink from the shirtless bartender. Returning to the roomful of goths, I say to my crew, “We’ll have to turn it up a notch to compete with the gays! How are we going to compete with the gays?!” They give me a look that says I’m a moron. Finally enough goths start dancing that I join them. Then I’m dancing wildly, thinking that it’s been too long since I’ve done this, haven’t danced in a club space since I came out to Pennsylvania. Wait, why the hell am I in Pennsylvania? Whatever. I’ve been drinking. When I leave the dance floor, Alice has messaged me: “Meet us outside?” I am loquacious on the car ride back. I fall asleep in the time that it takes three people to walk across the street to the Wawa and to buy an assortment of food products including three Cow Tails (caramel treats from heaven) which are left on the futon for me to consume when my cell phone alarm wakes me up. 6 Picture me up on a ladder, merchandising cat food in a store that’s not open yet. Thinking back to earlier in the day, when the co-worker with whom I felt most able to talk began staring into the birdseed in a way that seemed familiar to me. She was young, in community college, not prepared for this sort of work. She said something about how it was hurting her and she didn’t want to keep working, but she also didn’t want to get fired. She went to talk to somebody and soon another co-worker had taken her place with me in the bird aisle. During the lunch break I see the overwhelmed girl sitting, looking unhappy, away from everyone else. I watch her climb into the passenger’s seat of a car in the parking lot and eat her lunch there. "

    "body": "I finish the first edit of the Portland segment of my Life Story. If each of us carries around a life story, one we believe so as to explain and flatter where we are today, shouldn’t it be damning to remember how needy we have been at times, how annoying, how arrogant, how spoiled, how self-defeating, how unstable? But my journals should encompass all of this. The Story should be a comedy about someone who writes his own life, writes it over and over again, polishes it, lives it over and over again, sometimes beautiful and sometimes broken, sometimes understanding and sometimes mistaken, showing himself for a time and then hiding himself for a time. I’m writing in a diner. A flat-screen television broadcasts a report about the socialite and heiress Paris Hilton returning to prison. Diners jeer and laugh at her while I smoke a cigarette and write into a bound journal-book. Emily is going to drive from Reading to come with me to Bluejay’s birthday party tomorrow night. I’m really not convinced that Emily and I will get along at all. Truth be told, I’m sort of confused as to why she still chats with me. Saturday, June 10, 2007. Early in the day I walked, having showered for the first of what would be two times this day. I was trying to deposit my paycheck. I reached the Sovereign Bank at JFK and Market, then thought to myself, “Crap! I forgot a pen. ” So I walked down to Walnut, thinking that I could buy a pen at the CVS there. Well, what do you know? I realized that I had brought a pen, after all. Whatever, I thought to myself then, while I’m at the CVS I may as well replace the razor that I forgot when I went to Massachusetts the last time. I’ve been using a Mach 3, right? I called my mom. Yes, it was a Mach 3 and by the way, she was at Sunset and Dawn, in the house where I grew up, which now is the home of Aunt Renee, Uncle Mike and my cousins Michael and Keith. There was a gathering happening for Michael’s graduation from high school. “Oh, cool, tell him that I say congratulations,” I said. I was in CVS, deciding what I would like to drink. I chose a SoBe Power. I’m sort of surprised that these SoBe drinks still exist: it’s been more than a decade since their heyday and the market for soft drinks has been changing all along. It seemed important at first, the rise of SoBe drinks, some underdog company cutting into the sales of Pepsi and Coca-Cola and A&amp;W Root Beer, Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper and all the other dozens of flavored, carbonated corn syrup put forth as different varieties of the same thing, different breeds of the same animal, that animal being called “soda” or “pop” or “Coke” depending on where you live. SoBe tapped into our superstitions, selling vitality instead of flavor: “Energy tastes really good,” one was suddenly able to say. Nobody mistook it for medicine, but we figured that it couldn’t hurt to drink Power when feeling weak. SoBe was, I think, the beverage that set the stage for the convenience store coolers that we know today, coolers catering to a public that is not as in love with soda as it once was. Still, by now we have seen the rise of Vitamin Water and fitness water and energy drinks and enough SoBe-like products that I wouldn’t blink an eye if I were to notice the original SoBe label vanishing. The brand is still hanging in there, offering new Life Water, which is an imitation of Vitamin Water. There will be a last SoBe bottle, just as there will be a last Coca-Cola bottle, just as there will be a last and evaporating droplet of water. My mom handed the phone to my cousin Amy, who had driven up there from Virginia for her brother’s graduation. “Now you’re starting on, what, your Master’s?” she asked me, when I mentioned my impending move to Baltimore. She’s been enjoying Virginia, she said: “There’s a lot of history there—the plantations and everything. ” By the time our conversation was finished I was just reaching the ATM again. In addition to making my deposit, I withdrew some cash. Back in my room I sat in the air conditioning for a while before shaving, showering again and cleaning. Emily was late in arriving; she was standing in front of the by then closed Green Line Café Powelton Village when I met with her. We went to the same pizza restaurant (next to the Wawa that I always go to on Chestnut) where I had eaten with Alyson. Bluejay text messaged: “There’s no party. ” No elaboration. Emily was not as mean a person as I had worried that she would be, but it was difficult to keep a conversation going with her and when I asked random questions, she seemed weirded out. “Well, that’s exciting,” she would say sarcastically about anything else that I tried to say. It seemed that nothing was good enough for her, but she had no suggestions for anything that we could do and she raised few topics of conversation. Among the ideas that I put forth for things to do tonight I said, “Well, I was sort of invited to go out to this lesbian bar, Sisters. ” (Claudia had finally invited me to hang out with her and her friends. ) “Oh my God, no. My sister goes there. ” I asked her why she wouldn’t want to go out to where her sister goes out. She said, “You don’t understand. My sister and I are on different levels. ” Back to my room, I looked on the Internet for ideas of what we might do. Emily just stood around awkwardly. Eventually (wanting, I suspect, to be anywhere that was not my bedroom) she said, “We could just go to a bar, I guess. ” I tried driving us to South Street, but after far too much time trying to find a parking space I gave up and drove us back to University City. Then Bluejay texted back, “I’m feeling better, if you and the Internet girl still want to come over. ” Because Philadelphia is insane it was too late to buy liquor or wine, so we stopped at a pizza place, where I bought a six-pack of Yuengling and Emily bought a 40 oz. or whatever of Smirnoff Ice. At 17th and Manton we find parking, walk inside. It’s just Bluejay and Rob. There’s no explanation for why the gathering was originally canceled. It’s not long before Mindy and Jim come over. (I met them when Bluejay took me out for my birthday, wow, that was like six weeks ago. Mindy has since turned twenty-one. I wished her a happy birthday via LiveJournal. ) At first Emily isn’t talking, but the girls welcome her into conversation and then Emily’s saying, “I’m from Reading, but I’ve been going to school in Rochester,” and Mindy’s asking, “Do you know someone by the name of __? Wait, I’ll log into MySpace and show you a picture. ” Emily walks over to the computer. (Bluejay is sitting nearby, cooling themselves off with the fan. Meanwhile, Rob is talking with me about video games and comic books. ) At the computer with Mindy, “Yeah,” says Emily, “The girl in that picture? That’s my old suitemate. ” Later, after Rob has taken Jim and me to the kitchen to pour us each and equal share of a beer called Fin du Monde, Bluejay enters and says to me about Emily, “We like her!” “Yeah,” I say, “I’m glad that you invited us over after all. She wants to move to the city and I was hoping to introduce her to people. ” “I hope that this is, like, a dating thing between you and her. ” “No,” I say, trying to keep my voice down because Emily is in the next room. “No?” asks Bluejay, “No on her part, or no on your part?” “I sort of… never thought of it that way,” I mumble. I sit on the steps out front when I want to smoke a cigarette. Earlier I texted Arden to ask whether she knew of anything fun to do in Philly on a Saturday night. Now she responds that she’s sorry she missed me, she’s in the city and just saw a show, but it wasn’t that good. I tell her that I’m at a small gathering, that she’s welcome to come, but she says she’s had some beer and is not about to drive anywhere. I’m on a dark, narrow street, where several of the buildings are abandoned and have broken windows. I’m tilting a beer bottle to my lips—I’ve been told that I always drink from glass bottles as if I’m wearing lipstick (although I rarely actually am). It’s amazing to me how we all inspire each other, most of the time forgetting how much of an impact we have, how we impress the people who in our life story maybe don’t seem to play that big a role. Aren’t we coming to see that we each and all have invisible tentacles? Adria, an Internet friend of mine, moved from Minneapolis to NYC, starting a Master’s in English. She recently posted in a friends-locked entry about a guy who seems to be following her around. She linked to a comment that he had left in one of her public posts. I read this comment, then switched to a different browser tab into which I had open a friends-locked entry from Marybeth—remember her? And there was the same guy, leaving a comment in Marybeth’s journal. Where was Marybeth these days, anyway? I remembered that she had invited me to a party where she had been living at the time, and I had arrived to find several strangers finishing a game of Strip Twister. I hadn’t seen Marybeth that night—she had already gone to bed—nor have I seen her since. But Marybeth is in Richmond now. We all are wanderers, whether we admit this fact to ourselves or not. We are wanderers through time, wanderers (stuck to the Earth) in the solar system. Wanderers in our age. Julian has texted me to say that Ellie may have a job in D. C. , maybe they’ll move there. I need to enroll in my classes at Johns Hopkins. Has enrollment begun? I checked this week. The course schedule was up. Enrollment was beginning soon. Part of me wants to stay in Philadelphia, but I know that it’s just my current happiness (which will flow away if I don’t follow it) that is making me think that. (Never stop running. ) Upstairs to what looks to be Bluejay’s office, I say, “Bluejay! These are your books? How much of Proust did you get through?” (The very beginning of the first book. ) And the Anaïs Nin and Henry Miller. I already knew that she loved Tom Robbins, of course. “No wonder we’re friends, right?” said Bluejay. Do they know? I had to wonder to myself. Do they know? “I love your hair,” says Mindy to me. “Oh, thank you! You love chaos, then,” I say. At the end of the night, after I’ve given Bluejay a huge hug, Mindy says, “We should hang out sometime, since you won’t have a friend in Philadelphia anymore after Bluejay leaves. ” (It looks as though Bluejay and Rob are going to move to Portland, Oregon after all. ) “That would be great,” I say, “Definitely. I’ve already added you on LiveJournal. (And to Jim) I looked for you on LiveJournal, too…” “I haven’t posted in a long time,” he says. “Yeah, I think I saw that you weren’t using it. ” We’re outside, by that point. Emily and I go back to my place, where she had left her iPod plugged in. Then I drive her to her car. “You look tired,” I say. “Yeah. How long have I been here, now?” “Not too long,” I say. “Right. Well, goodbye. ” She’s out of the car in a flash, unpleasant. I spend the next day writing. I drive Baltimore Ave. to the Baltimore Pike to the old Panera Bread, then I walk around downtown Media for a bit and get a slice of pizza, then I stop at Starbucks. This weekend really flew by for me. Okay, this time for real, I’m going to start focusing on my moving to Maryland. Registration begins tomorrow morning. Salma is feeling down. I sound down, too, when I talk about moving on from Philly just as I’m starting to feel like I could stay here. Trying to hold on to people never works out, I say. “Love to you,” she says. This is what we say to each other instead of “I love you”. In the morning after 7 AM, the Hopkins online system lets me log in but says that I can’t register. I don’t get it. I drive to work. It starts raining. At 10:30, all the employees stop what they’re doing to meet and discuss the company picnic, which is happening on Wednesday. The itinerary includes a water balloon relay and other such fifth grade activities. Brian, the twenty-year-old with whom I tend to chat during smoke breaks, says that there’s no way he’s going. As for me, certainly there’s no way that I’ll be participating in the… competitions. Instead of meeting up with my fellow “yellow team” members I walk to the bathroom, then attempt (and fail, due to my not having the appropriate change) to purchase a candy bar from the vending machine. Back at my cubicle, a woman from the “yellow team” has been looking for me. She tells me that they’re all going to be wearing yellow tee shirts and so she needs to know what size to get for me. How does this all not seem ridiculous to anyone except for me and Brian? I can’t help but to smile, saying, “You know, I don’t think I’m going to participate. ” She looks like I’ve just shot her dog while she crosses my name off from the list. The people sitting in the cubicles behind me talk to each other, “Levi’s not going. ” “What!” As we’re leaving for lunch, Asia says to me, “How can you not be going on Wednesday! You’re trying to get hired, not fired!” Apparently, skipping out on the company picnic is one of those things that a person just Does Not Do. You know when you’re stopped at a red light and someone rear-ends you? Not badly, though, no one hurt, no damage, because they were already slowing down for the light but then they got distracted or whatever? That happened to me again today. I was just out from work. I didn’t like feeling that I was in the way of traffic, stopped there after being hit, with my hazard lights on. “I was getting my daughter her sippy cup,” said the woman. It was raining, but not slippery. It still is raining, but not slippery. I should be getting home for various reasons, including registering for courses if possible and handling the fact that the commonwealth of Massachusetts now is expecting a lot more from me than really seems fair, considering that I’ve been living in Pennsylvania for three months, that I’m working and paying rent here: I’m supposed to go to jury duty, plus Mitt Romney left as his gubernatorial legacy a law imposing tax penalties on anyone who does not have health insurance and so I have to figure out how that’ll affect me. Basically I’m expecting an evening of clicking through a lot of poorly-indexed web sites, calling phone numbers only to discover that it’s outside their regular business hours and so I’ll have to call sometime during my lunch break while I’m munching on my sandwich, and so on. Even the slightest car accident can be a downer—especially on a rainy day—so I stop at the mall and buy myself an ice cream cone. I get it cherry-dipped. As soon as I get home, Salma calls. She wants to know what I think is the purpose of being alive. We talk for about two and a half hours. By then I’m lying down on the mattress and feeling tired, I think that I’m going to fall asleep. As it turns out, I can’t actually sleep. I’ve already “pre-registered” for two courses—Fiction Techniques and Contemporary American Writers, the former in Baltimore and the latter in D. C. Now I’m awake, drinking some iced tea that I just picked up from the Wawa. Zella sent to my phone a picture of the guy she’s seeing, so I took a picture of the french bread pizza that I was about to cook and added the caption, “Oh yeah? Well, this is my sweetie!” Meanwhile, poor planning on my part results in my eating Smartfood and a Twix bar for lunch. The idea of taking on loans is now scary, but I think I’m going to go through with it, yes. Yes, I’m going to go through with it. Now I’m focused. "

    "body": "25 I skip out on the company picnic, run errands instead. Thursday, I’m late for work. I stare at this notepad, eating ice cream again. Waking up wouldn’t be as difficult if I were living with a lover, I think to myself. 26 “Consider it a nice little one-week vacation,” says the guy from the temp agency, telling me that the company won’t have any work for me next week, that I should return the week after that. I get the message at 5 PM on Friday, as I’m in the men’s room at a urinal before leaving the building. 27 Flashback. Thursday, Jonny calls me just as I’ve parked, as I’m walking towards my apartment. Not for any particular reason. He’s had a few beers. He and his girlfriend Jenny will be moving to a bigger, nicer place soon. A house that they’ll be renting. Still in Orlando. After that I take a call from Lyric, who is just calling to say hi. Bluejay IMs to say that they’re bored and Rob’s asleep, so we should go out to the Philly Diner. I bring my nice-looking paperback copy of The High-Speed Dub. They start reading it, express interest. They eat buffalo chicken strips and an omelet. I eat a bacon cheeseburger. Then we’re standing outside of the diner and I’m saying that we should do something else. “Let’s drive around randomly! I’ll drive!” I’m pushing the idea. Finally they cave in and I drive us onto 76 North and they suggests going to the Valley Forge National Historical Park. It’s after one o’clock in the morning. I think this is a great idea. So, we’re off to where George Washington’s army camped out when the British had seized Philadelphia, or whatever. The place is nice, well-maintained, and completely, ludicrously infested with deer. It’s not okay to hunt in a National Historical Park, apparently. I park the car and we stand next to the arch, then walk a bit. We find a firefly—just one. I scoop it up into my hand. “I’m holding a firefly!” I say to Bluejay, “This is amazing to me! You have no idea. ” Then I drive them back to her car, move their space heater from my trunk to theirs, go home and sleep and wake up in time to call in late for work. 28 I text Zella, asking her to tell me a secret. Then I nap and wake up to her calling. Sorry Zella, I’m pretty groggy. Then Bluejay is texting that I should come over. I head over. A couple of their friends are there, but they leave after a little bit. By then Diamond has come over, though, and then it’s mostly her and me talking while Bluejay and Rob slowly begin to seem more and more tired. I haven’t yet thought too much about this whole “nice little vacation” from my temp assignment. My initial reaction was that I should immediately begin to look for something else—a job for what, six weeks? But it could happen. That other temp agency I applied to—the one that was supposed to email me a data entry test and whatever but didn’t—has been emailing me job openings (mostly ones out of my league) but maybe they’ll have something. A little sheet was passed around to the people on our work team today, about a “party” during lunch break someday next week, partially as a “welcome” to the new people. People were supposed to bring in “real food” and hang out in the break room at a certain table. The call from the guy at the temp agency made it sound like it wasn’t just me, they just didn’t need the help of the temps next week. Oh, well. Diamond talking about her “mallrat days” again. Wow, she meant at the King of Prussia Mall. Talking about loss, tragedy, directionlessness. Bluejay is lying I guess on Rob’s lap. They’re reading The Zinester’s Guide to Portland, a gift from Diamond. I text Alice because I haven’t heard from her in about a week. I tell her that I’m hanging out at somebody’s house. “How do you make friends so quickly?” she asks. In the morning, graduation robes are up in the bathroom of the apartment where I live. It’s the day of graduation ceremonies at Drexel. I already knew this because Rob is graduating from there, too. I drive to Route 1, get some gas, and eat at McDonald’s. I go to the old Panera Bread, add various Baltimore and D. C. communities to my LiveJournal. I’ve finished my coffee from McDonald’s; now I’m hydrating myself with a Green Apple Jones Soda. Jones Soda still always makes me think of my times in Bakersfield. Bluejay the night before still thought that it was sad, me having a college degree and not really using it. A degree has to be part of your greater plan, I told them. It’s not a key to the city; it’s a key to certain doors. You have to prove your residency in a particular city first. (“We are not responsible for lost or stolen valuables. Always beware of you surroundings,” reads a sign at Panera Bread. ) 29 I’m unclean and unshaven. These past five or six weeks have been my first time ever working the same shift five days a week. It has been amazing. I’ve been high on it. Now I’ve been dropped from that high. It’s a temp assignment, remember? Fine, then, I think to myself. I didn’t leave anything important in my cubicle. I now have Craigslist ads open in my browser. See? That one says that I could start on Wednesday. Another temp assignment, I can come up with a story about why I will have to leave after… two months? I have two months to move to Baltimore? Calm down, Levi. That’s plenty of time by your standards. It was less than two months between your deciding to move to Philly and your actually moving into a room in the city. And you had already been working for a while, then. I have to keep running. They always find out that I’m not like them. They see my anxiety. Then I’m Superkid again, on my own and saving the world… 30 I hang out at Alice and Franklin’s place. They have a Jack Kerouac poster on the wall. Hi, Kerouac. I like the mad ones, too. I was born destined to make no difference in the world, born to fantasize, playing my video games and reading my comic books. I was destined to accept my sad place and to think it natural, but then somebody from a future timeline came and talked to me and made me feel important. There was a tear in the fabric of whatever it is these things make tears in, and I was self-aware, sentient, and willfully moving in new dimensions. Everywhere but not everywhere I looked saw I new magic, saw I that we were talking about it, saw I that there were messages from before I was looking and after I comprehended. Language is a proton pack and magic is the ghost that evades a particle beam. It is also a particle beam released in another direction. I have a car. I could just drive to anywhere in the continental United States right now. I could drive to Niagara Falls. The Grand Canyon. My friends in various cities. New York. Sunny Florida. The Deep South. The arid desert. The Pacific Northwest. I think the waiter at this diner wants me to leave. I’m staring at the page. “Believe in yourself,” a voice in my head is telling me, only it’s a not a voice—it’s an idea diluted into solution, bromide handed to the future and then sent back by the self-aggrandizing “angels” who work under the “fates”. And ideas are themselves just strung-together words. Identities are ideas. If a word is typed that does not imply a narrator, does it possess a meaning? “Identity” and “narrative” are synonyms. This story is my identity. This story is what I believe to be true. I can’t post this to the Internet anymore. I haven’t been able to for some time. Salma text messages me: “I like it when u talk/write a lot! So, sleep problems, anxiety, n awkwardness, huh? Well my friend, I think u r wonderful… aren’t we all messed up to a degree?” 31 Back at my apartment, I’m at blogs where people are writing about the academic job market. What is it like to teach at community colleges? My laptop seems to be dying. The battery—or maybe just the cord?—is going kaput once again. (Here is what I think of when I think of people teaching at community college. I think of people floating, first of all. Did you inherit that house? It’s your ex-husband’s. Your friend says to come adjunct here. How do I pay the medical bills? He flew away, couldn’t take it anymore, staying with his friend in another country. Day in and day out in this same little apartment with the cat. We’re different: we’re artists. Family back home feels so distant. Never wanted to move here. Drink, but not too much. Is this professional? With some gallery owner, this is the continuing fun of… but we can still have fun, you whisper. Like being a teenager. Sleeping well and having so little guilt over what you do. ) It almost sounds good. Keep smiling. The art is now. The ideas are now. Besides, I want to move to Canada. What would I do there with this degree? See, I’d like to do broadcast captioning or something. Still have to look into… how’s the job market for… whatever in Canada? College instruction in another country? That may not be super-feasible. “You’re not looking for a roommate or anything, are you?” I text Zella. “I love you,” she responds. She further clarifies, saying that I should come to Seattle and that she has always been in love with me. I take that as a “no” to the roommate question. Bluejay already suggested that I should move to Portland, Oregon… but I would rather not be where V. is, if only out of politeness. For places with court reporting programs that leaves me to choose from Virginia—where I’d be around family, but I would also be in Virginia—or… I could stay in Philadelphia. 32 A morning headache. Blame last night’s consumption of wine. I awoke, cleaned myself up, it was off to South Street to meet Claudia in person for the first time. She was there with four others—her sister, two males and one other female. The males were named Damian and Steve. We actually didn’t spent very long at the club. At first we were all sitting on a couch, I was at one end next to Claudia and of course in those situations it’s impossible to hear anyone except for the person next to you so I always find that a little weird. Claudia and her sister, the former thirty years old and the latter twenty-eight. Everyone dancing and I don’t want to yet. Claudia’s sister standing alone. This is the same club, Fluid, where I went to Sex Dwarf, the ’80s night. I recognize the bouncer from last time. Questlove from The Roots is DJing. I stand and talk with Claudia’s sister for awhile. Already Claudia and I have gone out for a smoke and then Claudia’s sister texted her, “Did you go to smoke without me, bitch?” and then joined us and I saw the photographs of her artwork. We’re all going to the South Street Diner. I ask Steve for his life story. I don’t learn much, but it’s him I’m talking to as we walk. We all eat, then part ways. Walking back to the car, I call Salma. She’s at a party at Janelle’s. Lyric’s there. I talk to Lyric for a while. I’m still on the phone once I’m driving. Salma takes the phone back. Lyric is convinced that I should go to Johns Hopkins instead of staying in Philadelphia. Salma, too, sounds shocked and disappointed when I tell her I think I’ll be staying here. Alyson will be coming down again, Tuesday and Wednesday, will be crashing at my place. She says she’ll know by then whether Courtney is going to be moving too, and if not then we can look at places together. “Are you going to look back with regret at not taking this opportunity (to go to Johns Hopkins)?” people have been asking me. I don’t think so. Salma said to me, “But I see how people react when they know that I went to Smith… and especially how they treat to people who’ve gone to, like, Harvard or Princeton. It’s the name of the school, the association. And Johns Hopkins is a good one. ” 33 Start M. A. at twenty-six. Graduate at twenty-eight. Then? Continue toward an M. F. A. , we will imagine. Graduate at thirty. Part-time instructor? Other cash-earning strategies? Impressing the right people? Out of debt when? When I write a best-seller? What happens to the economy? Big Brother is watching, but nobody cares about that, so I guess I may as well not care, either… 34 I wake up dreaming about Arden, actually, this morning at 4 AM. Yesterday was sitting around with, walking through a nature preserve with, and lying on separate spots on a living room rug picking at cat hair with her. The dream was her asking something like, “We’re seeing other people still, right?” when in reality we’ve only hung out in her apartment twice and taken the aforementioned walk through the preserve. (In the dream I tried to be obliging, the same way I usually have been with people in real life, saying, “Oh, well, sure…”) I feel a bit embarrassed to think that my mind is there; although, I don’t know who would blame me for thinking these thoughts if they had seen her leaning in her doorway while I was leaving: “Hang out again soon?” After hanging out with her it took about twenty minutes of driving before my brain chemicals could feel normal again. I try not to get excited when I feel like this. This is just me starting to get to know someone and increasingly being attracted to them. I will try to turn the feeling off like a faucet if I start to get the impression that it’s unwanted. Until then, I will enjoy the not-knowing. These things usually don’t lead to much, but theoretically, one day, with one person, they might. 35 Arden said that she had a habit of waiting to see what would happen to her—of wanting to see what her options would be, then “hoping that there aren’t too many of them”. Maybe, she said, she should take an approach more like mine—making things happen. I said that I think I, on the other hand, have been devoting myself so much to trying (albeit awkwardly and not always with success) to make things happen that maybe I should relax a little more, to see what happens to me. It’s a rainy morning now. I’m in the parking lot, back at work. I’m looking forward to finding out what happens. Will Alyson and I look at places together, to be roommates? Arden… do I dare even think it? (Barely. ) Will I be gainfully employed? Will I write anything notable in my life? Will work today be awkward? Stay tuned. "

    "body": "36 Lunch break. I’m wearing my long hair down today, not tied back into a ponytail as usual. People are commenting. Mostly they’re giving it the thumbs down. I left my lights on this morning and now my car battery is dead. 37 Maybe I should go to Baltimore after all. 38 One of my co-workers gave me a jump start. Then I drove around. Then I went home. I checked my email. I chatted for maybe a half hour and then went to sleep. I slept until 3 AM then got up, had some coffee, looked at apartment listings in Baltimore. Alyson had left a voice mail and text message. Courtney does still want to move to Philly with her. Would I be interested in looking for a 3-bedroom? It’s 7 in the morning now. I really should hop in the shower in like twenty minutes. I’m trying to decide what I’m doing with my life within these next twenty minutes, so that I can call Alyson and know what to say about why they should just keep looking for places without me. Why do I now feel so sad about the idea of moving from here? I never felt that way about Massachusetts, no matter how many wonderful people were around me, no matter what I had going for me. I wonder why it feels so different now. Okay, it’s time for a cigarette. Then I’ll be rushing… talking to Alyson on the phone while I’m on my way to work? I don’t know. 39 I guess it’s because I feel like there’s the possibility of a future here. In Massachusetts I never saw a future unless it was linked to a relationship with someone. I’m not sure why it always seemed so imperative that I leave the Valley, but it did. Alyson might bring Courtney with her. They might be coming today. I’m not sure. I cleaned my bedroom just in case. The idea of leaving here is heartbreaking, but I also sense that there would be a heartbreak on the horizon if I stayed here. There is heartbreak everywhere. I find it difficult to trust any vocational, technical or “career” school. I find it intimidating to learn those sorts of skills when I know fully well that fitting in and being “the right sort of person” are the only ways to find a spot that is at all secure in any profession. 40 June 27, 2007. After work I come home and chat online for a bit, complaining about my increasing certainty that my laptop is not long for this world. Considering how much I’ve used the thing in the past two and a half years, I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. I do something that is in between napping and sleeping until I get the call from Alyson and Courtney saying that they’re nearby. I stumble downstairs, sit on the steps and feel like I’m on a new Spring Garden Street, the Spring Garden Street they’ll both be seeing as their first impression of where Levi is living now. Getting out of the car, Alyson squeals. I give each of them a hug. 41 (I didn’t write about my last trip up to Massachusetts. My excuse for driving up there this time was that I had to pick up my contact lenses and also because, having a week off, I could think of no better time to go. And maybe I felt like I had nothing better to do with all that free time. Free time, ha, as if it was free. It was expensive. I went to Janelle’s with Salma while I was up there. Several people I didn’t know were in the house, discussing social justice. Mostly I just sat around. It occurs to me that I left a half bottle of white wine either in my trunk or in the spare bedroom—the old Chaos Room—of what is now my mom and Bruce’s living space. I went to Haven with Lyric. Jesse the UMass student, Shepherd’s boyfriend, and I talked about academia. He’ll probably be applying to grad programs next year. ) 42 Courtney rolls over slightly, there on the floor. I’m still sleeping on the mattress that was left for me. “Good morning,” I whisper. She groans a little and scratches herself. “Do you want coffee?” I whisper. She snores. It’s 6:20 AM. Magnet, the kitten (so named, I’ve been told by my roommates, because he is a “chick magnet”) meows outside of the door. Last night he didn’t want to leave the room, even after the lights were off and we were trying to go to sleep. He kept wanting to pounce on my head. Now he chases my pen and leaps on top of Courtney. All things considered, letting a cute little kitten run wild isn’t all that bad a way to wake up houseguests who I’m sure would have preferred to sleep in for a bit longer. 43 As it happens, though, they do manage to sleep in for a bit longer. I tell them that it’s okay. More of my upper-right wisdom tooth falls out. Work is just fine and dandy until 3:00, when I’m pretty sure it’s all of us temps who are let go, already again, this time for a week and a half. So I need a new computer, a job, and somewhere to live by mid-to-late August. And I’m not sure what city I want to be in. 44 Now it’s Thursday afternoon, hot and humid but you know what’s special? The sporadic breezes, which cool you off and then it’s just the sweat, but if you wipe the sweat then it just might seem okay. I feel like it’s time for me to go somewhere, to write my way through this. Magnet is climbing around on the computer chair in my room, being amazingly cute. I pick him up and nuzzle him. He climbs onto my notepad. I’m sitting on the mattress. I pick out some clothes—all black, perfect for a summer’s day—and head downstairs to shower. 45 This is how the story went. Alyson and Courtney in my room, bantering with each other. Figuring out what they’re going to wear. Alyson finding parts of her skin that are peeling, then saying, “I’m Peely McPeelerson!” The three of us were planning for a while to go out for dinner. Really this was Alyson’s idea. As soon as you put me in a place that has cloth napkins to put in your lap, if I’m feeling the slightest bit awkward I will be pushed into super-awkward mode, a mode in which I only do and say stupid things. Meanwhile, of course, I’ll be thinking, Did I just spend eleven dollars on a plate of spaghetti? But checking out apartments in Philadelphia is a special occasion for them, I have to remember. (Anyway, Alyson pays for us all. ) The two of them are having a conversation about whether they have Jew Noses while I’m using my phone to send Alice a picture of Courtney, Do you remember her? (Yes, from a long time ago. ) Mindy had just added me to her MySpace friends. I had messaged her, saying that she should come out to Nocturne. She had said that she’d like to go. I had given her my cell number. She called while we were at the restaurant. I said that I’d give her a ride, that she should text me her address and I’d map it once I was back at my apartment. Ugh, Alyson and Courtney and I were driving around for so long before settling on a parking garage. Soon they’ll be going to a place called Whiskey Dix, near Shampoo. Pick up Mindy before you come over to drop off the space heater remote, says Bluejay via text. Alyson and Courtney have left already for Whisky Dix. I shower. The cute little kitten is following me around wherever I go. I can’t find Alyson’s skirt, which I was going to wear out to the club. Pouring rain, thunder and lightning outside. I recently miraculously managed to fix my left windshield wiper blade, which had been sort of awry and making a screeching sound whenever I used the wipers since one particular attendant at a gas station in New Jersey (where all stations are full service) cleaned my windshield but yeah, the blade popped out when he lifted up the wiper. I’ve written down in Sharpie (which is all I can find when I want a pen, although when I want a Sharpie I only find pens) the addresses of some gas stations in the city. I find one of them, at something like Walnut and 22nd. Fire engines are driving by, sirens going. You can hear the lightning striking. You don’t know what it’s striking. Gas is approximately three dollars per gallon. In the Fall of 2001 it cost approximately one dollar per gallon. We are spoiled. I am especially spoiled. Imagine now that Alyson and Courtney are at Whisky Dix, which they will later describe as “a redneck bar”. “There are rednecks in Philadelphia?” I will ask. Alyson will shrug her shoulders. But for now, let’s just imagine that they’re being spunky—maybe overwhelmingly so—and talking to somebody one of them has connected with through MySpace. A bartender there, maybe. This is how they are going about trying to till the land of the city. Alyson wants to find work as a bartender. “We’re taking over Philly!” they keep saying. Earlier in the day, they returned to my place with the results of a spending spree. Courtney says that she misplaced sixty dollars during one of her transactions. Is there a Western Union nearby? Courtney could bother her mom to wire money. No, says Alyson, it’s cool. Imagine now that I’m pumping gas. Going inside, buying cigarettes from the man who stands behind glass. At this same moment, anyone could be pulling up any of our MySpace profiles. There are plenty of ways one might stumble upon a profile—searching for an interest, or maybe you know one of us and are searching by name, or maybe one of us is a friend of a friend. Maybe you’re in Missouri. You would see that Courtney has a lot of friends—over 3,000. Likes to promote bands. Somebody asked her for an autograph once, she said to us while we were in the Italian restaurant. (I didn’t order a drink with my spaghetti, only had water. I didn’t even know how I should eat spaghetti in public, being in the restaurant reminded me. ) Imagine that this was one of the stories told while I was sitting there, spacey, texting. The autograph she’s talking about was given out in a 7-11. Somebody recognized her from the top friends of a band she knows. “You know that I’m not in the band, right?” We need to believe in invisible things. There’s a rumbling in the distance. Later in the evening, little do I know as the gas seems to be taking a long time to pump (but didn’t I already pump my gas and buy my cigarettes? Guess I’ll have to do it again, for the purposes of this writing passage) that I will be dancing on a dance floor while thinking—innocently, I will convince my guilty heart—about the latest Some Person To Dream of Relaxing Next To—liking someone, you might say. Someone who is not there at the club. There is no such thing as dating. I wish that there were, sometimes. I wish that there could be security. Wouldn’t it be nice to feel like it was appropriate to get excited sometimes? I again buy the only pack of cigarettes I buy on this Wednesday night, this dark and stormy night. This day seems to last forever in the moment. I have never been to this gas station before. I am living in the fifth largest city in the United States. I haven’t seen most of it. I have a fear of being as sheltered as I know that I am. Tomorrow (although I have no knowledge of this now) it will happen that I go to the Concord Mall in Delaware for no particular reason. Another storm will be coming in. It will seem to be the same storm. I will think that the last storm must have felt like this one. Oh, of course! That breeze. But there is no such thing as a storm. Everything is in flux. We agree that our agreement can turn an uncertain everything into certain somethings. What I don’t know as I am pumping gas is that when Mindy and I arrive at Bluejay’s, Bluejay will be upstairs trying to set up the fish to be moved—taking glassfuls of water, pouring it into jugs. They’ll have arranged to give the fish to Smarf and Kestrel (now living in Philadelphia). Rob is going to be downstairs, packing other stuff. There’ll be a lot for them to get in the truck and after that, a long drive before they get to Portland, Oregon. The space heater will be in the living room, so I’ll leave its remote on top of it. Mindy and I will hang out upstairs, chatting with Bluejay for a bit until Mindy will say, “We probably should be going, shouldn’t we? It’s already after 11. ” Jonny is going to call from Orlando during the ride to the club. “I’m heading out to a goth club,” I’ll say. “Well, it’s not Tuesday,” he’ll say, “Which means you’re not going to Haven. ” “No,” I’ll say, “A club in Philadelphia. ” I’ll hand the phone over to Mindy for a bit. I’ll be talking with Jonny until we’re just outside of Shampoo. Mindy will be a little bit awkward when we first get inside. It’s going to be her first time here since one night a few years ago? She’s not accustomed to the club scene. The rest of the night will seem to me as follows: standing around, I make introductions when we find Alyson and Courtney. Alyson is decently sloshed throughout the night. She and Courtney are networking, being friendly to everyone. Seems like they’re putting on a performance. Mindy, it seems, doesn’t know what to make of these two. Gradually she gets used to dancing. (She’s creeped out by an older guy. I understand. He knows that she’s creeped out. Alyson and Courtney have been friendly to him. Mindy whispering to me as he is exiting and we’ve already exited the club, he throws what I think is an empty cigarette box down onto the ground. I take this to be his way of saying, “I can hear you whispering about me!”) To each her own, I can’t entirely see what Alyson sees but she’s eager to hang out with a “cute boy” after the club. Mindy doesn’t want to stand any longer—bad choice of footwear, she says—and I was expecting to go somewhere with a restroom, but instead we’re off to Lorenzo’s, where each of us gets a slice of pizza. “These slices are so huge,” Mindy and the boy are being reminded, although I must concur with Courtney when she says, “No, anyone from Northampton knows that this isn’t that big a slice. It’s not even that tasty. I mean, it’s good, but…” Yes! Someone to back me up on this. People are coming by, honking at the boy, getting out of cars and talking. The locals ask, “Why are you moving here?” “If you’d ever been to Hartford,” says Alyson, “You’d understand. ” “Well, then, welcome to Filthadelphia. ” “When I think of South Street, I don’t exactly think of privacy,” I say, but I manage to relieve myself in an alleyway without anyone walking by. Eventually Mindy, who has been advocating for us to get going, just starts walking away, knowing that I don’t really feel like hanging out any longer, either. I drive her back to her apartment, helping her out by carrying a bag of clothes, which Bluejay had given to her. Hugs, cheers, see you later. Then back home, Alyson and Courtney are supposed to be on their way. Time passes and I’m lying down and… At 8:38 AM on Thursday, I will be woken up by a call from Alyson. Her attempts at reaching me several hours before will not have worked. They’ll have been sleeping in the car. They’ll have given somebody a ride somewhere, then ended up lost prior to their attempts at calling me to get back inside. In a muggy heat, too. Imagine them in their club clothes sleeping in Alyson’s red car, which is messy and full of stuff. For now, the rain drips from the overhang under which I pump my gas. Tomorrow afternoon I will write, “West Chester, Pennsylvania. I’m walking it and for whatever reason—I can’t articulate why—it doesn’t seem like anywhere I’d want to be. I’m coughing a dry cough. Drink more lemonade!” After which, writing at the Concord Mall in Delaware. The storm. Text messages. Bluejay really needing help moving. Here’s me driving back into the city. Shit! What am I doing with myself? Mindy is there, helping Bluejay and Rob, who continue to pack stuff, moving boxes into the rented truck. The rain continues until it lets up. Why are those guys hanging out next to my car? It seems like they’re looking at it. No, Bluejay assures me, I shouldn’t worry. This is a slummy neighborhood, but they’ve never had problems with the locals. In fact, now these guys are volunteering to help with the move! Hi, strangers! Bluejay tells them there’s a bunch of beer in the fridge if they want it. What? Yeah, we’ll take some beer! But that’s not why we came over. We want to help you move! The weather is hot, so hot. I hurry upstairs to pack what is left into boxes, hoping to avoid being talked into doing heavy lifting. One of the guys is moving things from the living room out to his friend in the truck. He’s barking orders: “Put these under the table! That way they won’t break!” I’ve taken a Vitamin Water bottle from the car. I keep refilling it with tap water. Well, this is speeding up the move. I don’t know if Bluejay, Rob, Mindy and I alone could have gotten everything out of the apartment tonight. “This is place is beautiful!” says the guy who’s been arranging things into the truck, once he comes inside, “Is this an inheritance?” He’s the slower of the two, always sounds bewildered, has bad teeth. “No, we’ve just been renting it,” says Rob. “Wow!” I’m overhearing from the kitchen, where I’ve sat down and am drinking water while Mindy is saying, “This is kind of weird. Personally, I wouldn’t be comfortable with some guys off the street just coming into my house and moving my stuff. ” “All my dreams! All my dreams are dying!” the guy said, gazing around him, awestruck at this rented row home. “They’re almost done here,” I said to Mindy, “We could probably just take off now. ” After I’ve dropped Mindy off I call Salma, who is working overnight as relief staff for a group home. We talk about cynical vs. idealistic thinking. Imagine her being paid basically to stay awake. That might not be such a bad gig, I suppose. Imagine me lying on the mattress on my floor, pretty tired, eyes droopy but it’s great talking with Salma. We talk for just short of three hours. “If everything were exactly as it’s been between us, but you were a woman,” Salma says, “I feel like we would be closer friends. ” She never used to feel that way, but as time goes by she sees more and more, men doing these things… and men she thought weren’t like that… “And I remember the early days with Johnny, listening to him talk about how he was a feminist…” Salma on Muslim life: “Men act and women are. ” “I like how you put that,” I say. I feel like this is a common expectation. I couldn’t figure out what it was about watching Courtney and Alyson getting dressed, picking their clothes, doing make-up… (Salma: “A woman sees herself, even when she’s alone. She sees how she would appear to an observer. ”) After all the time the two of them had spent getting ready, I looked through my dresser at the very, very, very limited assortment of clothes I had to choose from. Asked what I was doing, I responded: “Trying to figure out what I’m going to wear. ” Alyson: “I thought you were wearing the skirt. ” Me: “Well, I’m not going to only wear the skirt. ” Courtney: “Why not! You’re a guy, you can get away with going shirtless!” (This is a joke, not a serious suggestion. ) “Except that I would never go shirtless,” I say, “Unless I’m completely naked. Then, for some reason, I’m fine with that. ” “You’ll look beautiful no matter what you wear,” says Alyson. I don’t believe she’s being sincere. I’m thinking about myself, invisible, needing to act. “If you don’t play the game, you end up shit on,” Salma says. I’m afraid that she’s hardening, that she will disappear from me at some point. What I don’t know as I am pumping gas is how many eyes are on me. I am so rich in irony. That is how the story went. "

    "body": "46 Friday night I’m driving, texting with Claudia. The next day is her day when she’s free to wander, her ex-husband taking their daughter, but it seems like everyone’s going away! What if she has no friends tomorrow! It’s the weekend before the fourth of July. I say that I’m free tomorrow. She responds with something like, “Well, you should find something to do! Hey! Did you know that CURE tickets go on sale tomorrow??” I jump to the conclusion that she’s making fun of my goth tendencies. Only the next morning (following another depressive, overlong sleep) when she IMs and asks, “So did you think of something fun for us to do?” do I realize that she actually did mean to hang out with me and that Cure tickets really did go on sale today. We decide to meet up in the afternoon to go to the Mütter Museum. She meets me in front of my apartment. We walk to the museum. We spend a good while inside, looking at the medical curiosities—human skulls, animal brains, the plaster cast of and the conjoined liver which once belonged to the “Siamese Twins” Chang and Eng. Then we eat at a Cosí, talking about our families. We walk back west from Center City, get coffee at a Wawa and sit for hours talking about lives and friends and relationships. When I ask her opinion, she too thinks that I should do my Master’s. “You seem the professory type,” she says. She has me choose the music for her to listen to on the drive home. I choose The Flaming Lips’ Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. After I sleep, for the second morning in a row I begin to get down to business online, wanting to figure out, you know, everything about my life. Then my day again gets pulled in another new direction when I see that the new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist, has leaked. Clearly I need to download it and go for a drive while listening to it. The album isn’t great. I decide to listen to it again, starting at the beginning. Then I get into a car crash. Teenage boys playing innocent about rear-ending me, sending my car smashing into another car in front of me. I’m shaken. Things are falling. I’m in the car. When is it over? Is it over? Is the car accident over, or will there be another jolt? How bad will this be? Forward, then back. Okay, I’m not going through the windshield. I’m not bleeding. Nothing’s exploding. Look how banged up the front of the car is! That’s crazy! No damage to the boys’ car. Minor scratches on the “just out of the lot” car of the woman who was in front of me. I’m stumbling around, waiting for the cop to come. What is this an omen of? Warm Pennsylvania first of July. I’m in Springfield township. It’s an omen of nothing. I’m just exhausted from being confused and panicking over nothing all the time. Franklin says that although he and Alice are at the shore for the weekend, I can park in their driveway for now—in front of their friend’s car, which has a license plate from Quebec. Aunt Kim says to fax the police report to her school, she’ll get it tomorrow and look at it. She’s good with stuff like this. I walk to the Fed Ex/Kinko’s, do that. I also put my laundry in the wash on the way there, so when I come back I just change it to the dryer. I read for a little while, write for a little outside of the laundromat. Bruce calls, wants help connecting to the Internet. I try for a long while to help him to troubleshoot. Then I’m waiting for the R3 at the Morton station. Doesn’t this bring back memories. Arden texts: “Looks like you’ve hit a spot of bad luck this week!” I would discuss this with her further, but my phone is about to run out of juice. I need to pee. I hold it in. 47 I wake up to a phone call from my mom. It’s about 9:30 in the morning. The fax didn’t come through very well, the information too light to read. Okay, I say, I don’t really feel like re-sending the fax or anything so why don’t I just type up what’s on the report and email it to Kim? Even though I sort of don’t understand at this point why this is necessary. I make coffee, have some of it while smoking a cigarette on the front steps. Go back upstairs, set the cup down on the floor while my new laptop is on my mattress. I move the laptop closer to me and the cord knocks over the cup of coffee. I go downstairs for paper towels, come back, clean up the spill, type the information and email it. I shower for the first time since before I went to the museum. Not bothering to shave. What next? Alice calls and asks where I stashed the keys for my car. Oh, that’s right. I was supposed to leave my keys, since I’m blocking in their friend’s car. I am so hungry. It’s already past noon? Did it take me an hour to clean up that coffee, or what? Time is wacky. I’m walking toward the Wawa to get a sandwich and coffee. I’m on the phone with my mom. I say to her, you said that the car was covered by this insurance company but the report says that it’s covered by this other insurance company. Oh, that’s right! she says, The Saturn is covered by the other company, so you’ll have to look up the number online, I guess, then give them a call and give them all the information. So I should do that today? I ask. Yes, probably. Okay, I think to myself, then I won’t head straight to Morton. I should withdraw the money for my rent while I’m out, anyway. Sometimes ATMs won’t let me withdraw that much at once. First I eat my bagel melt and drink my coffee sitting on that little set of steps around the corner from the Wawa, where nobody bothers me. Then I walk to the bank. It’s a long line. “Do you have an I. D. ?” the teller asks. I look for my license. I can’t find it. I show my old UMass I. D. plus my debit card. “You don’t have four hundred ten dollars in your account,” the teller says. “Okay, then I’ll just take what’s in there, I guess. ” “You need to fill out another slip. Here. I’ll help someone else and then get back to you. ” Finally I get the money. I walk home. I count up my money. Okay, here’s the bundle of cash that equals my rent. Maybe I’ll check LiveJournal. The insurance company calls. “We don’t see a Saturn here under the insurance. ” “That’s right,” I said, “There was some confusion. The car is insured through a different company. ” I go online and get the number for the correct insurance company. I’m on the phone for awhile, describing the accident and giving the information for all of the vehicles involved. I text Bruce the file number, tell him that the insurance people want him to call them back. Kim has left a voice mail while I was on that call. While I’m listening to Kim’s voice mail, Bruce calls. Kim’s voice mail says that it wasn’t actually _ insurance, it was __. She has faxed the information over to them, but I need to call. Bruce is calling to say that Alyssa’s up from Florida, they’re going to Cape Cod for something? He’ll call the number that I texted to him when he gets the chance. I return Kim’s call, leave a voice mail explaining everything. She calls back about ten minutes later, hasn’t listened to my voice mail yet. She says that yes, __ is the brand of insurance, but she meant in her message that the company where Bruce’s insurance agent works is __, not __. __ is the agent’s name. She’s the person Kim sent the fax to. I should call and let her know that I already spoke with someone at __. I talk to the agent, who is pleasant. She is when I call just then typing up the information, which I already typed up. Kim has faxed both the original accident report and my transcription. The agent working for the company that deals with insurance companies is transcribing the report using both a facsimile of a facsimile of the report and a facsimile of a printed-out email attachment of my transcription of the report, which was the fourth and most difficult to read carbon copy of what was written by the officer on the scene. Okay, she won’t fax her transcription, since it seems that they already have it thanks to my calling and reading the information from the carbon copy of the report. Someone will be out within two to four business days. I can’t find my I. D. I hope I left it in the car. (I did. ) 48 Independence Day with Arden. Meeting at 30th Street Station. Walking. Talking. Well, that pizza place I always take people to is closed. Um, is a Chili’s okay? Great. So we have a table. Drinks to start you off? I get a water, a Coke, a blue margarita. She gets beer and a mushroom and Swiss burger. I get a bacon and cheddar burger. I’m great with the random questions. Where does she see herself in five years? That’s a hard one. How about me? Wow, that is a hard question. Where did she think that she would be now, five years ago? She would have been, let’s see, twenty-seven. Certainly it wouldn’t have occurred to her that she might be in Pennsylvania. She had plans, then, to go west. She wouldn’t have expected to stay there, though, so probably… five years ago, she would have expected that right now, in 2007, she would be back in Maine. How did she get into this line of work, anyway? By the time she was twenty-seven she had already done driving around the States, taking only back roads, with her girlfriend. Early in the relationship, blossoming love plus wandering to that degree? Wow. Yes, they were on the road for… three months? Wow. Yeah, that was certainly something. Mmm, burgers. She wanted hers as bloody as the restaurant was prepared to make it. She pays for both of us. We walk and I say, “You have me wanting to drink more beer, now. ” “Hey, I’m always up for more beer,” she says. Also, I need to pee. Okay, then, we’re looking for beer and a restroom. Drexel security people say that we won’t find a beer distributor open on the fourth of July. They say that maybe this one bar would be open… but we’re walking by the Chili’s anyway and it’s starting to drizzle. The same hostess greets us. “Hi again!” I say to her. We’ll just sit at the bar this time. We each have another three or four beers. She says that she’s a pretty quiet person. I say that it hadn’t occurred to me… Right, because I’m great with all the random questions. I ask for her to ask me something. She can’t seem to come up with anything to ask. Okay. She comments that she hasn’t yet seen me wearing all black, even though I say that I usually dress that way. Huh. Well, she’s probably seen most of what I have that isn’t black. I estimate for her how many tee shirts, button-ups, pants, and skirts I have. After each drink we step out into the rain for another cigarette. It begins to pour. “There’s where we were going to be,” she says inside, pointing to the television screen, which is showing Hall and Oates performing by the Art Museum. We had changed our original plans to go to the big celebration the city was having. The lyrics of pop/rock songs can seem even sillier when you can’t hear the music, when you’re just reading the… “teletype,” Arden calls it. Is that a real term for it? When we’re finished with our last beers, knowing that I want a cigarette, “How about,” she says, “You go outside. I’ll take care of the tab. Then I’ll go pee again and I’ll meet you outside. ” “Are you offering to pay for me again?” She nods. “Aww… you’re amazing,” giving her a hug. Outside, I’m squishing up against the wall as much as I can. There’s a tiny bit of overhang, providing just a little bit of shelter from the downpour. Arden next to me, then an arm around me. Hugging. “You’re cuddly,” she says. “You too,” I say. “Sometimes I am,” she says. It comes to the point where we’re out there, getting progressively more wet, our left hands holding. “You have nice hands,” she says. We could try waiting out the storm back at my apartment, but how far from the train station would that be? How much time do we have until she should leave? People who’ve parked nearby run to get inside the restaurant, to get out of the rain. What do we do now? The question emerges, but is inconvenient, so instead we keep our faces in each other’s hair. She gives me her hoodie to wear. I asked her what love was, earlier. That was one of my random questions. She rambled, sounding as confused as I would have been if someone had asked me that question. There are different types of love. Not fair to compare… there’s love for family, or for longtime friends… “And I’m just getting to know you, but I care about you, so I have a love for you… and I’m not going to say, ‘Oh, but I love my old friend more. ’ Why would I do that?” “Do you think you’ll ever have children?” I asked at another point. “Together?” she laughed. I pretended that I didn’t understand how she’d misheard me. Never say never, but she doesn’t feel like she wants children. And me? “Yeah, probably at some point,” I said, “I love kids. ” It’s rare for me to get these feelings for someone new. Still, I downplay them in my mind. Still, I make sure not to obsess over them. Clearly it’s a challenge. Fortunately, I’m stubborn with myself. One of these years, the soil will be right, the rain will be enough and something—something—will grow. Another example of me being random: “You know what you should do if you ever get back into photography? Take pictures of flowers—it can be a series—different kinds of flowers, smoking cigarettes. ” Flowers smoking cigarettes. Somehow, in my mind, that’s love of love, right there. 49 I handle multiple calls about auto insurance while still on the mattress, asleep. My car needs to be at Alice and Franklin’s place tomorrow. Somebody will come by at some point during the business day. I’m at the old Panera Bread with the new laptop, looking for job leads when the guy from the temp agency calls. I say that I’ve lost some of my enthusiasm for Arista, considering how the work has been off and on. He suggests that things should be “back to normal” now, that they let some people go but specifically asked for me to come back. I said okay for now but asked him to keep an eye open for if any other jobs became available. I’ve also been bidding on freelancing projects online. I figure that’s worth a shot. I finally mailed out my signature for the financial aid paperwork at JHU. I have to be out of this apartment by… August 27, I think. 50 But maybe I should stay in Philly. 51 It took a half hour for my new computer to come out of hibernation this morning, another half hour for me to close my open browser window and word processor documents. My old computer was almost five times as quick to do what I wanted it to do… and it was partially because I thought that that was slow that I figured it would be better to just buy a computer now and get an extended warranty on it. I still have some of the junk software to remove from it, but if it’s this bad, will that make a big enough difference? 52 I am angry at that computer. Angry at companies paying to have their software be pre-installed. Angry at stores for then charging customers for the removal of those programs. Angry at companies flooding the Internet with articles meant to earn them revenue through advertising. Angry to be growing up into a life in which “you have to learn to market yourself”. Angry that it’s supposed to be the victim’s fault, the poor man’s fault for not being cutthroat enough. Angry because there is so little product of America’s labor anymore aside from our own misery. Most of our jobs are unnecessary. We are nuisances to each other. We are united in nothing. I am angry that I am marketing drugs to doctors. I want to be cuddling. I want not to need to be so tangled up in all the smoke and mirrors. I am an American. I hate traffic and driving. I want to sing. I want to hug. I want to cuddle. 53 I’m thinking in my head, My New Year’s resolution was to record an album. Maybe I should make a batch of songs about how boring and lonely life can be. (To a melody) I’m washing clothes… for no one but me… “Excuse me,” says the woman who is putting her own batch of clothes into a nearby washing machine, “This isn’t 24 hours, is it?” “Yes, it is,” I say. “Oh, okay,” she says, “I was looking around for a sign and I didn’t see one. ” (Sitting in a funny position in the car, for a moment I’m certain that I’ve ruptured my appendix. Fireworks or firecrackers or whatever are being set off nearby. I get out of the car, still smoking a cigarette. Then it doesn’t hurt anymore. ) I call Salma. She’s at Janelle’s going away party. Lyric’s there. Salma hands the phone to Lyric. I end up telling her a little bit of what’s on my mind. Then she hands me back to Salma. Now I feel bad for talking about how depressed and confused I’ve been. Salma says that she should go, she just got to the party. Right. I close the phone. Tomorrow I’ll be hanging out with Arden and her friend Diane, who is down here visiting from Brooklyn. (Can you believe that I forgot to mention? As Arden and I were partying ways on Independence Day, her kissing what amounted to a bunch of my hair and maybe a little bit of my cheek. ) I haven’t made use of but a fraction of my methods for meeting new people in a new place. I barely even communicate with Julian now. I’m not afraid of the city anymore: at least I’ve gotten over that. 54 I spend the night working on the Life Story. I’m up to the stuff with Bailey and Mandy. That was almost five years ago. It feels like it, too. Now, Magnet Is leaping on me. It’s suddenly 4 AM on 07/07/07 and I feel like I’m some silly teenager because I’m thinking about Arden. That poor woman, having me think about her in this way. Reader, maybe you have an opinion. Am I okay? I mean, I know it’s pretty crazy, living and documenting my life like it’s a novel in progress. And I know that I’m twenty-six years and old and still am not financially independent. And yeah, I have some pretty crazy ideas, sometimes. (Magnet climbs on the page. ) What if I now, having met someone I find attractive, click with, seem to have some chemistry with, see eye-to-eye with notable ways… since it seems like I’ve been doing okay so far… what if I now gain some of that confidence I’ve been promising myself, keep putting myself out there, let her see me (and smell me, since she seems to like that) and keep getting to know her and while no big, flashing warning signs are saying, “STOP” then just do my part towards getting to that place I always want to be with someone? And if that doesn’t work, then I just try it again with the next person? Would that be crazy? Why does it feel like it would be? 55 And then? Since my car started smoking on the drive back from the laundromat (I noticed at a gas station where I was stopped in order to buy cigarettes—a guy asking for change helped me by putting water in the radiator or whatever, so then I felt like I had to give him money, although I have almost no cash left) my car sits parked and I sit in my room. I’m in sweatpants for most of the day. The pants I was wearing for the two days prior chafed me from all that walking and sweat, so sweatpants are I figure a good alternative. What do I want to do with my life? Where do I want to be? I work on the Life Story. Early on in the day it seems like I’m not going to meet up with Arden and her friend after all: the last train out of the city is pretty early, so they probably won’t have much time… but no, I say, it’s not like I’ll be walking all the way to Center City and back. I can take the train. We meet up at 16th and Walnut and go to the first bar we see, The Happy Rooster. (They find me as I’m leaning up against the outside of the Starbucks there, smoking a cigarette and reading Jesus propaganda that somebody just gave to me. Arden hugs me. Diane and I are introduced. Then we find the bar. ) At first I don’t really feel like drinking anything. They order expensive whiskey, straight up. Coinciding with their second glasses, I get a glass of pinot grigio. We’re outside. People ask us for money. I’m not even feeling insecure; but they’re dressed up, having eaten a Nice Dinner. (Reminding me of what Alyson and Courtney seemed to be going for when they were down—am I the only one who doesn’t think of Nice Dinners as something one must do while in the city?) Also, they act like they know what they’re looking for when they look behind the bar. But whatever. That’s just me feeling out of the loop, somewhat. The conversation is good. (But also, I think to myself, no one ever invites me to dress up for anything!) 	I part with the two of them at Suburban Station. Arden kisses and smells my hair. A text later: “Goodnight beautiful! Glad you came to meet us!” Back at my apartment, I see that I’m out of cigarettes. It occurs to me also to walk to the Philly Diner. Jonny calls. We talk about this and that. I ask him what I should do with my life. He tells me to find something that I want to do, then to pursue doing that. “Supreme Court Justice!” I say, but I somehow doubt that’s what my story is leading to. "

    "body": "56 A guy talking to me: “You know there’s a law now that says you can’t eat out of the trash? But you know what’s still legal—humiliation. ” As I’m remembering this, a fat pigeon pecks at the ground next to me. 57 I try to figure out how to take public transit to get to work on Monday… but I’m angry at that place and have only had about two hours of sleep and when I check the SEPTA web site in the morning I don’t even see the same complex sequence of trains and buses I had figured I would take when I was on the web site the night before. There’s a heat wave outside. Ha-ha, it’s like I have seasonal depression, but the opposite of the way it is for most people, it’s during the summer when it becomes a problem! Give me a frozen New England winter night… I’d rather walk through that than through this. If I want a rental car, I’m going to have to pay for it up front and then the insurance agent will deal with the insurance of the driver who hit me and work to get a reimbursement. Then if that can’t happen, what?… I try to write a brief summary of my life thus far, because I think that it might help me, erm… place myself in the present. It helps a little bit, reminding me of the absurdity of life, although it always saddens me to write about my childhood, because it all feels like lies, because I’m working mostly based on my own memories, which are vague and vanishing and based on how I saw things when I was young. It’s like I’m trying to find something in my history that I’ve never noticed was there before. I was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts in 1981. Raised in nearby Chicopee—a small, working-class city best known as the site of the Westover Air Reserve Base—my father received training as a machinist through some sort of government-sponsored program. My mother came from a large, closely-knit French-Canadian family. As a child, while my mother stayed at home with me, much of my time was spent in the company of her immediate family. I was reading and writing from a young age and showed exceptional promise throughout grade school. My father was a church-going Catholic; my mother was never much religious. With the latter’s support I was allowed to stop attending Sunday school in the fourth grade. Similarly, when my father began to make plans for how to afford sending me to a Catholic middle school, I insisted on attending the local public school instead. By that time, my mother was employed as a restaurant cook. My father, meanwhile, having been laid off, was collecting unemployment benefits and studying French, first at Holyoke Community College, then at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. [I’m not sure when he was at college. I suppose he must have been at UMass after the separation. ] My parents’ relationship began to fall apart. I took my mother’s side. Nearly a teenager, I was resisting my father’s heavy-handed style of parenting. I stayed with my mother when the two split. Although I had begun to develop obvious motor tics—repetitive eye-rolling and clearing of the throat especially—I was never diagnosed with any disorder. After several sessions with a therapist it was concluded that I did not require counseling. I was ill-prepared for the comparatively rough middle and high schools I attended. My grades subsequently dropped. Although my mother’s new relationship with a truck driver named Bruce was stable and helped out financially, I had few friends and was seen as an underachiever by teachers. Still, I remained an avid reader and writer of both poetry and prose. I withdrew from high school on my sixteenth birthday. I spent most of my time on the Internet, then. For a long time I had had difficulties sleeping at night; this did not help when it came time for me to try working my first job, in the restaurant where my mother worked, busing tables and washing dishes. I was anyway quick to decide that I did not want to do this work. I was still sixteen when I took my first classes at Holyoke Community College. My grades that first semester were one A (in Psychology), one Incomplete, and two withdrawals. That Summer I traveled on a Greyhound bus to California for the first time, visiting friends I had met in chat rooms online. For the next two years I would repeatedly switch between trying to live and work in California and trying to attend community college in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, I updated a web site with experimental writing and journal entries. By 2000 I had begun to associate with other students taking Drama classes. I acted in several plays and even went so far as to write, direct and star in one, Memory of a Nightmare, which, though billed as a one-act, after significant cuts ran approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. It was, for the most part, not well-received. Morale among the eleven-person cast had been hurt when, during the rehearsal period, I left the state for three days to see The Smashing Pumpkins play a farewell show in Chicago. I gradually lost interest in college. I worked in a record store, in a video game store, in a movie store, in a convenience store, in a sandwich shop, as security for a department store, as an over-the-telephone research interviewer, as a relay operator. I began spending time in nearby Northampton, meeting people in the local poetry, music and goth scenes. I spent one Summer in Portland, Oregon, trying to settle there, but that didn’t work out. Having dabbled before in recording electronic noise, I started playing shows as an alt-folk singer and as the front person for a short-lived rock band. I recorded several albums by myself and distributed them for free. I lived sometimes with friends but most often with my mother and Bruce. I continued to post my journals to the Internet, specifically now using LiveJournal. When parts of my social scene began to fall apart, I became more reclusive. I took offline most of what I had posted over the years. Living with several roommates in Northampton, working as a barista and then for a second time as a convenience store clerk, I decided to try one more time to attend college—this time at Greenfield Community College, in the more rural Franklin County. I succeeded, finally, in completing an Associate’s Degree in Liberal Studies in the Spring of 2004. Since my grades from HCC were not factored into my G. P. A. at GCC, I graduated with a 3. 0. An agreement between the state’s public colleges required UMass Amherst to admit me. Since I had taken CLEP tests in place of Composition credits, the upper-level electives I took this semester were only the second and third English classes I had completed since my freshman year of high school. I earned ‘A’s on all of my papers and was advised by instructors to consider graduate school in either English or Creative Writing. I moved into an efficiency apartment in Amherst. I was accepted into the Honors College, wrote a creative thesis of fiction and graduated cum laude with an English major in the Spring of 2006. I would have had a minor in Latin, having taken 15 credits of the language, but I dropped the required course in Roman Civilization during my last semester to concentrate instead on my graduate school applications. I applied to a number of M. F. A. programs. I was waitlisted at Syracuse University, and the University of California- Riverside invited me to take a spot in their new program beginning in Palm Desert, but that was all. (I was given reason to believe that my letters of recommendation had played a part in my not standing up to the competition for spots in these programs. ) When I graduated, I was already in a relationship. I thought we were going to live together. To save up money I immediately went back to my old position at the convenience store in Northampton. I took a second job delivering for Domino’s Pizza (a job that I had also done before and during my first semester at UMass). I moved back into my mother’s house, stayed there for about six months (while going through a breakup). I applied to just a few academic programs this time. I considered a million different plans for my life. Socially, I was mostly just hanging out at karaoke nights in Northampton. I hung out with a revolving cast of old faces who disappeared, then reappeared into my life. I knew I needed to move somewhere new, whether it was for school or not. Things felt stagnant to me and I saw nothing that I could do locally to change that. When my old friend Alice said that I was welcome to stay on her and her boyfriend’s couch outside of Philadelphia for as long as I needed, I thought it over for about two days before putting in notice at both of my jobs. My friends were told that I was leaving about one week in advance. Just as I was moving to Pennsylvania I found out that I had been accepted into the M. A. in Writing program at Johns Hopkins. I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to accept the offer or not. (I was also accepted into the M. A. program at the University of North Texas, but I didn’t seriously consider going there. ) I didn’t have a car at first. I had my laptop, which I needed to take to the Panera Bread (a mile or so away) in order to get Internet access. I applied to various jobs until I was hired to be a Pet Training Instructor at a Petsmart. There, instead of being trained, I was used for several weeks just as a helping hand to set up the new store before it opened. I quit that job around the same time I took a sublet in a three-bedroom in West Philly with some graduating Drexel students. I worked for a couple of months in a temporary position as a phone rep for various pharmaceutical companies, calling doctors’ offices. The position was 9 to 5, 5 days a week. I loved the stability until the temps were suddenly told not to show up the next week, then halfway through the week after that told not to show up for another week and a half. I was an anxious mess, changing my mind just almost every day about what I wanted to do with my life… but I felt, also, that my move to Philadelphia was a move into something that I was not going to be able to step away from. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I at least was gaining confidence in who I was. 58 Arden invited me to go to a show in the city. She warned me that it would be really hot inside the venue. We met up near the Market East Station. I was hungry, so I led us inside to the Gallery. Unfortunately, everything was closing up. There were still people ordering at the McDonald’s, so we went in there. By the time we got our food, the employees had locked up the front door. We were instructed to leave through the door marked Restrooms. Back out in the mall, “Let’s sit there,” I said. “Where they haven’t gotten around to putting the chairs up yet?” I saw no better option. It was air conditioned there inside the Gallery. We ate some, then were predictably told that we couldn’t sit there any longer. We loitered near one of the exits, standing and eating until someone else told us to leave. We finished our food outside. “If we still have time to kill, I could go for a coffee,” I said. We walked around looking for coffee. After we had stopped at a 7-11 and sat next to planted flowers, beneath a planted tree, we found that the temperature outside was cooling. Arden kicked her legs like a little girl. We had scooted up to sit on a concrete wall, or something. We didn’t go to the show. The sun was going down. She said to me that I seemed like an urban guy, that it made sense I should be living in a big city. We heard a saxophone in the distance, but we couldn’t see the person who was playing it. Love is always temporary, I told her. At first, she thought that I was saying I thought it wasn’t worth it. No, no, I said, I mean, I think it is worth it. It’s worth it to try and make the best of what’s here. If all we have is sand, then let’s build sand castles. Although, I didn’t actually say it like that. “You guys aren’t from around here, are you? Please tell me you’re not from around here”—a frantic-looking man holding an envelope and a ticket marked VIOLATION—”People here are mean! The city of brotherly shove. Listen. I’m not a bum. I’m not from around here, either. I need to catch a train while I still can. I’m HIV+, just found out today. My car was booted while I was at the clinic. ” He is, of course, something like the sixth person tonight who has engaged us in conversation and expressed a dire, emergent need for our money. She gives him what he has asking for—six dollars, eight dollars? “You should marry her,” he says to me, thanking her repeatedly and then walking away. Soon, I notice that I’m stepping over a swarm of cockroaches. “Ew!” a woman squeals, noticing the bugs. “What, they’re just roaches,” says the man she’s with, “It’s not like they’re going to bite you. ” We’re walking here and there, through a few different neighborhoods. We find a bar. It’s pretty empty. There are nice couches and nice tables. This would be a good place to go with some friends or whatever. She orders a Dogfish Head. “I’m not copying you,” I say, “But that’s what I was going to get, too. ” We talk about celebrities: Do you think that so and so is attractive? We’re on the second floor. Across the street, a light turns on. A white woman is standing in the window of a loft. The light turns off and then on again later while we’re sitting there. Arden and I only have time for one beer each. Having the proper change, I pay for both of us. “Are you sure?” she asks. I smile and say, with sarcasm, “Because of course, you’ve never bought anything for me. ” “Well, I have reliable employment and I’m… settled. ” I hope that she’ll invite me over. Walking to the train station, “There’s a lot to look at in this city, isn’t there?” I don’t use my senses much when I’m on my own. I rush from place to place. I get lost inside my head. She invites me over. We’re on the train for about an hour. The two of us read silently from the Philadelphia Weekly. Our shoulders are touching. It’s nothing to get excited about, getting along. “As I’ve said before—life is short, but life is also very long. I know where my twenty-six years have gone. ” “And I know where my thirty-two years have gone,” she says. Also, getting along. She nurses one beer and I drink three. “Have you been on any dates since moving to Pennsylvania?” she asks me. I laugh, “Shouldn’t I know better by now? I mean… you know, what we were saying earlier about… it starts feeling like a job interview when you think of it that way. ” It’s an uncomfortable moment. She tells me, “I’ve been on two dates since I’ve been down here. ” She talks about the people, how they presumed too much about what was going on between them and her. I say at one point, “Well, when you have sex with someone… that means a lot to people, sometimes. ” She’s kicking her legs again, I notice at moments. Whether she’s on her stomach or sitting down, it’s like a little girl does when she’s excited. She lies down on the couch-thing where I’ll be sleeping. After a time, I join her there. Squeeze, breathe, relax. This is good. It’s all smiles. …although, it’s also 6 in the morning. It’s time for her to get ready for work. We’ve kissed each other, but not much. The goodbye is where we do it the longest. I sleep on her couch, then wake up and walk to find food and take the train back into the city. Many hours later, as I’m writing this outside, another man asking for money is telling me another sad story. This one I don’t much understand through his lisp; it has something to do with epilepsy and four dollars. “You’re the only one who’s looked at me like a human being,” the man says, “You hear me? You’re the only one who’s looked at me like a human being. ” "

    "body": "59 We learn to love what we’re forced to become. When we need to be hard, we love to be hard. When we need to be caring, we love to be caring. When we need to be distracted, we love to be distracted. Words and expressions are repeated in popular music. We like the songs on the radio and we listen to them again and again. We don’t even need to be awake: the words and rhymes and sayings to which we’re compelled drill themselves even farther into our heads while we sleep. I can’t help but think that music helps this process. All you need is love. In the end, it doesn’t even matter. I’m still just a rat in a cage. I won’t worry my life away. You’re still the one I run to. You’ve really got a hold on me. Big pimpin’, spendin’ g’s. At least I know I’m free. The songs we’ve listened to bounce through our brain, little unconscious rituals. 60 Walking alone in the late night. I’m certainly not anonymous. I walk different streets, hoping not to cross paths with the same homeless guy; but I always do. Like a telemarketer he’ll collect your information and refine his methods. If you break down and give him something, he’ll of course try to get more from you. Intimidation is one of his strategies. 61 I set up an interview for Monday, for a data entry project. 62 I still haven’t been able to get the car to a shop. Having the insurance appraisal, I found a place that would work on the car and I tried to get AAA to tow it there, but I would need to go along with the tow truck? I had plans for the evening and certainly didn’t feel like waiting around and watching my car be towed and then finding my way back from… where? Oh, the information online is out of date, the place has moved and is even farther away than I thought… at night. (Probably they would just tell me to drive the car to the shop, anyway, and then it would be at my own risk, one would assume, any further damages would be mine to cover. I still don’t know why it started smoking the last time I drove it. ) Okay, fine. I will need to drive the car to a repair place. That being the case, I suppose I would be better off taking it somewhere I will know how to get to, near somewhere I will visit anyway. Near where Arden lives would be convenient. I have plans for dinner with her tonight anyway and I should be leaving about now. I shave and shower and drive. I neglect to consider what rush hour traffic is going to be like on the highways I’ll be driving. More than two hours later, I arrive safely in my poor little beaten up Saturn. Two grilled cheese sandwiches and some tomato soup is not very filling to me. This is the first I’ve eaten all day and other than some cheese and crackers later in the evening, this is also all that I’m going to eat before falling asleep. Arden and I together drink two bottles of red wine and roll around on the floor. We move to her bed and get naked. Some time passes. I suggest a cigarette and water. She dresses us in bathrobes. I always feel silly wearing a bathrobe. I have a wine headache and it’s getting worse. We go back to her room and take off the bathrobes. Some more time passes. I’m kissing her and saying, “Ow, ow,” regarding my head. We lie down to go to sleep. I would say that I fell asleep immediately, then—because by my standards I did—but even before that, I remember Arden beginning to snore. I sleep well. We’re awake. She makes pancakes and coffee. At moments we walk up to each other and I put my arm around her and she puts her hand up my shirt. I call a local auto body repair shop, but they’re not open because it’s Saturday. She drives us to the local mall, because I think that maybe I should buy some clothes or something. Really I’m just trying to think of something random for us to fill our time with. We walk around the mall, which is boring. We go back to her place and make conversation and cuddle. I ask if she would be interested in going to a diner. She says yes. Mostly I’m listening to her stories; I’m not very eloquent in my speech today. I say that I should get going, I’d like to get back to Philly before dark because my headlights are messed up. I get lost and am listening to The Polyphonic Spree’s The Fragile Army when the hood of my car unlatches and blows forward, cracking the windshield. I park on the shoulder and walk forward a bit to try and figure out what this expressway-type thing that I’m on is. I don’t know what town I’m in, but at least there’s a mile marker. I call AAA. I’m on the phone, trying to get a tow when a truck (Highway Safety or something?) pulls behind me and a state cruiser pulls in front of me. The officer makes me hang up the phone. I’m told to follow the truck while the cruiser drives behind me. In a parking lot off the next exit, then, the guy in the truck gets some ties to keep the hood shut. “Guaranteed your hood won’t fly open again,” he says. He gives me directions to where I’m going. “How’s your day going?” he asks, trying to make small talk. “Eh,” I say, looking over at my now even more beaten-up vehicle. “You’re lucky the windshield didn’t break on you,” he says. I call back AAA and cancel the tow. I drive back to West Philly. 63 I stay awake all Saturday night, into the morning. I wake up in the evening on Sunday, then, and stay awake all that night. Being without a car, I’m just sitting on my mattress for most of this time, putzing around on the Internet. In the morning I write, “July 16, 2007. ‘Round about eight in the morning. Overcast. Humid but without that infernal sun. I walked to a breakfast in two parts—a hash brown and iced tea at the McDonald’s, then a cookie and coffee at a little deli. I thought about what it would be like if Philadelphia were a Baghdad, a city repeatedly bombed. I have an interview for another temporary, sedentary job today. All is as it should be with me. Five or six more weeks here, then I move still further south. ” I’m in a nervous mood at the interview, but the woman who asks me questions is nice and saying things like, “With your skills, you can definitely believe that I’ll be shopping your resumé around. ” I drive then from King of Prussia to North Wales. I think that I remember whereabouts a Fed Ex/Kinkos is. Yes, there it is. I print out the quote from the appraisal company and call the auto body shop that is within walking distance of Arden’s place and the train stop for the R5. I’m feeling sleepy, so to stay awake until Arden gets home I go to see Ratatouille. By the time I’m out of the theater, the woman from the temp agency has called. The client has postponed the training session for maybe a few days to a week, so that they can train more people at once. When she left the message, she was thinking of having me start instead at a different job doing “basically the same thing as at Arista”; but when I speak with her she has already given the placement to someone else. Arden texts to ask whether I’m nearby. I reply that yes, I’m in North Wales. I drop the car off at the shop and walk to Arden’s place. We arrive at exactly the same moment. We sit around talking for awhile. I’m trying to stay awake but she tells me, “No, don’t sit up! You’re tired, go to sleep. ” So I do. I wake up around ten o’clock at night. She’s in her room, in her bed, reading a book. We’re in the bedroom for awhile. She lets me make some food for myself; I have a grilled cheese sandwich and eggs and a bowl of Lucky Charms. Because I’ve recently slept and am feeling bouncy, I don’t expect that I’ll be able to fall asleep. I ask her whether it would be a disturbance for me to lie next to her, then get back out of bed after she fell asleep. She says that no, she’s a deep sleeper. To my surprise, I fall asleep along with her. In the morning, the alarm has gone off a few times and she has been repeatedly hitting the snooze button. She asks me, “Did you sleep at all?” “I was sleeping this entire time!” I enthuse. I walk outside, past the downstairs neighbor, who is smoking a morning cigarette and surely remembers meeting me before. I walk with a spring in my step to the Wawa. I buy a whole bunch of stuff—a hash brown, a coffee, soda, Vitamin Water and I think a doughnut or something like that. Arden is off for work. In front of the house, we part ways. “See you later,” she says. “See you later,” I reply, feeling awkward for a moment because I’m bad at parting ways with people. We kiss. I walk across the street to the train station. Another, older man is walking near me. “That’s a nice way to start your morning, isn’t it!” he says. I stand away from the two dozen or so people who are waiting to catch the morning train into the city. I light a cigarette just in time to hear the ding-ding-ding of the railroad crossing. I listen to my MP3 player and text message with Julian and look out the window at rock and buildings and trees. A couple of different people sit next to me. I don’t look at them. I finish my coffee, try to be sure that I’ve drunk the lost drop. Then I throw the empty cup into my plastic bag, which is holding everything from the Wawa that I haven’t finished yet and also my copy of The Sot-Weed Factor and a little book for writing in. It’s been a while, but ideas for poems are coming into my head. I turn these ideas around and about, inside my mind. It’s a way to let the time pass. I walk from 30th Street. It’s hot. It’s Tuesday. I go back to my apartment, check my email and such and then start making phone calls to Baltimore, trying to look for an apartment. I set up an appointment to see an efficiency in Charles Village on Friday. I call several other places as well. I don’t see much for local jobs today. I wake up in the evening and stay up for a while doing whatever. Arden seems to have gone to bed early tonight. She text messaged me from her bed to say goodnight. I find this to be really sweet and wish that I had been awake to respond to her. Having someone with whom to intertwine really mellows me out, I notice. 64 Spending all day and night in my bedroom is not pleasant. I’m here all day, because walking outside in this heat makes me sweaty and miserable. I’m here all night, because I want to avoid getting harassed on the street. 65 Arden doesn’t know whether I’ll be living around here or in Baltimore come September. The last I talked to her about it, I said that I was probably staying. She must be guessing that I’m not certain. I could go… she could go. In bed with her, I sleep at night. Then I leave and life resumes its regular irregularities. A traffic cop around UPenn hops up and down, blowing into his whistle excitedly, like a child. I’m supposed to sign a promissory note and mail it in. I’m supposed to borrow money. To what end? “So you’re going to… what? Stay in Philly and keep temping?” Maybe. I look around this city and see reminders of my fear that we’re all stuck. I want to do something. I want to build and repair. I want to present findings. I want to make proposals. I want to do what it takes. I want to be responsible for something. I want to go back in time and… (unproductive thoughts) I talk to Jonny on the phone and he has been reading Ayn Rand. He says that if you want to do something, you can do it, you can be it… I suppose the secret to success is believing myths. Believe that you have worked harder. Believe that you were born with a gift. Believe in the businessman’s burden. Become a rock star for the song we are all singing. Believe in matrimony, submission and dominance. Believe in competition and the throw of a pigskin. Nod politely at the dreamers and the religious fanatics. Whatever it takes to survive—that part I understand—but we of course help our family, children and friends before we help a stranger. We help by continuing the myths. Then we go to war against the strangers. After victory has been claimed, some poet sings the battles’ praises and new myths are born. Is that it? An eternal, unjust, cyclical history? I guess so. I still want to believe otherwise. I’m staring at heavy machinery. I have reached no conclusion about what I’m doing. I don’t know anyone else from my home city who has finished a college degree. On my mother’s side of the family—the only side I know, at this point—there must be what, thirty of us? When I finished my Associate’s, that was a first. No one else had done that. By the time I finished my Bachelor’s, everyone was like, Huh? What, you’re still in school? 66 Baltimore was again surprising to me when, on Friday, I went there. How did I get there? Well, I rented a car. I went online, reserved a car, walked to the place. I got a forget what it’s called right now because I just woke up. It’s the morning on Saturday. Anyway. Now that I’m back in Philadelphia, it’s hard to connect with the feeling I know that I had, of parking, walking past the apartment I was there to look at, and saying to myself, “Definitely! I want to live in this neighborhood. ” A man sitting outside of the place, he was the other one taking a look at it. Pleasant enough to speak with. He has a house in Atlanta but owns a business here, usually sleeps in his office and showers at his gym, but this place is cheap enough, so he thinks it might work as just somewhere to sleep when he’s in town. When the guy who’s showing the place comes by and takes us inside, the Atlantan says, “Wow, it smells. ” This is true. The guy who’s showing the place says, “Well, it was clean when this tenant moved in. After we deep-clean the carpets and everything, it’ll be fine. It’s just that he leaves food lying around. And then he wonders why he has mice!” The Atlantan, at that point, thanks the other guy for his time, says that it was nice meeting me and jets pretty quickly out from the room. It basically is like a living room, a pantry-sized kitchen and a normal bathroom. First floor, the windows have, like, shutters over them, you unlatch them and pull them open and then there’s your window. The front porch is just a quick step outside. I get a good feeling as I walk around. A woman walking her dog, I think she notices me veer to try to make out which Tori Amos song it is that I hear being blasted out of someone’s window. Then I walk around the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University, which is pretty. 67 I keep with my ridiculous tradition of driving to Morton to do laundry. 68 Having behind me a couple years’ experience of slinging lattés, selling late-night snacks and so on to Smith College students, the idea of going somewhere and being associated with that class of people blows my mind—but more in a bad way than a good way. 69 Last night, Arden was telling me that I was beautiful, that anyone looking at me could see that. I both believed her and didn’t: I believed her in the moment, but I knew I would stop believing once I was alone again. 70 Texting me while I was on my way back from Baltimore (where I went to apply for that apartment) Arden asked if she would see me again soon. I asked, “How about tonight?” She agreed, making this the third night in a row I’ve slept over. “I’ve been surprised that you’ve been spending so much time with me,” I said. “Me, too,” she replied. It’s Wednesday morning. I begin a three-day temp job today. 71 Thursday, July 26, 2007. On my way to day two of folding folders and sticking papers in them at this job in Norristown. I guess I’m moving to Baltimore. I’m confused by how sweet Arden has been to me. I don’t know why it seems like she’s pulling me closer. I wasn’t expecting that. I’m just thankful and glad for everything. 72 Fifteen minute break. Yesterday I called another place I looked at in Baltimore and the small efficiency had been leased out. Would I be interested in a medium? Maybe, I said, I would have to think about it. I called just now to say that I’d be interested in that and those two are on hold, the tenants might be staying? So I should call back on the thirty-first, I was told… "

    "body": "73 Changing myself to “bisexual” on OKCupid is always a little sad. I tend to want nothing to do with the men who write to me there. A forty-something IM’d me last night. A lawyer. Got me thinking more about getting into law. 74 Another two bottle of wine night with Arden. This time, when my mind wandered to stories about people in my past, I just told the stories. All of the people I named seemed far away. 75 “I think I would go to Heaven,” I said. “I think you would, too,” she agreed. “In your face, churches!” I said. She said that she would go to Hell. 76 In Arden’s apartment, it seems easier. There, I’m the person I see her reacting to—attractive, laid-back but curious, younger, wouldn’t hurt a fly. Complicated and whimsical and open-minded. Not creepy. Not lazy. Charming. Really sensitive, but really strong. When I’m there, I see myself as someone who will be totally fine, it will just take some time and then I’ll see. Alone, I see myself as solitary, detached from the world, living in my head, awkward, someone who sucks at life, dreaming of perfection, missing opportunities left and right to be part of the human race… What am I so afraid of, that makes me so generally anxious? I’m afraid of being tortured… and knowing that the only way to stop my torture is to tell myself that I’m not being tortured… and being unable to stop the pain of being tortured… and then torturing myself for my failure to stop feeling the pain of being tortured. And I realized it just now… having put into words what that place I’m so afraid of feels like… when I stepped outside for a cigarette… that’s how my memories of my father feel. Not because he did anything to me in particular, but because… I don’t know. It just felt like that with him. I don’t have to apologize for how things felt to me when I was a little kid. 77 My laptop and I hung out today at the Green Line Powelton and then at Cereality. I was online looking at more apartments in Maryland. Then I walked back home and was online (doing what, I’m not sure) and then I drove to the McDonald’s down at 40th and Chestnut, I think it is… and being in the neighborhood I also decided to finally go to that record store… and I saw the new Rasputina CD and picked it up. Then I came home and went online and saw that they were going to be playing in Baltimore on August 8—with Shara Worden from My Brightest Diamond performing solo as the opening act! Shara Worden is the singer whose solo set at Fire &amp; Water in 2001 I enjoyed so much. Arden’s flight back to Pennsylvania was canceled. She’s in Boston, trying to figure out how to get home in time for work in the morning. I helped her out by looking up train schedules (none available) and bus schedules online. 78 I rubbed up against a cactus this morning. It was the kind that leaves a bunch of little needles on you. I just picked them all off and it didn’t hurt me at all. Aside from having cacti in front of the window that I open when I want to smoke, though, Arden has been helping a lot in making me happier. She leaves me to sleep in her bed and while at work texts me to express hope that I’ll still be there when she gets back. That’s not even mentioning how often she volunteers to pay for me, going to the ticket window and saying, “Two, please,” or how she seems to enjoy my compulsive kissing and lying on the floor while I talk about my fiction writing, how it always seems to be about three-dimensional characters finding their cartoon identities within cartoon worlds. (Friends are the people who will forgive us for slipping out of character… the people who help bring us back to our identity when we quite naturally stray away from it. We don’t just become career-minded; we become professionals. We don’t just gain wisdom; we become adults. If we “become our parents” it’s because we, like they, are trying to be heroes. The hard-working mother. The trusted physician. The accomplished artist. The cool, laid-back guy. Once we’ve made a choice, it’s like, I’m sorry, but they’re just not the sort of person I want in my life right now. This is part of the miracle of how we live more peaceful lives… we become cartoon characters, and see everyone else, too, as cartoon characters. So the poor are the poor, and the rich are the rich. Only actors escape. ) Also: “Moving to Philadelphia has given me plenty of opportunity to think about income disparity,” I said. And I remember a couple of years ago I said to someone, “You know, I’d only really like to be a scholar if I could be, like, a convenience store clerk on the side, too. ” That was an offhand comment, but it’s stuck with me for all this time because I always think, Why in order to talk with any ethos about the state of affairs in the world does a person need to be so removed from it? Someone has to do the dishes—does that mean that there need to be people who do all the dishes for people who only don’t do their own dishes because they’re busy writing laws about what happens to dishwashers when they get too old to wash dishes anymore? How wasteful it can all seem, millions of people doing jobs that solve none of our problems. Wealth invested in mechanisms to preserve wealth. Ecstatic from this conversation about things I actually care about, I crawl over her, and we make out on the floor. 79 I pet Arden’s cat. I’m hanging out in the apartment. I like it here. Last night, the two of us—(Arden and I, not the cat and I)—went through the road atlas and pointed at beautiful places. I’ve been to forty-five? states and she has been to forty-four. Last night among the random, usually trivial questions I always ask I was all, “Why do we get along so well?” and she didn’t seem quick to agree with the premise of the question, thought for a minute and said, “Yeah, I guess I do get along with you better than with most people” or something like that. I thought to myself, I’m going to feel unimportant again, aren’t I? I remind myself not to talk as though we have been or would be or might end up dating. She had told me that was part of why she started going for men again, instead of just for women, whenever that was, a couple of years ago: it was easier to avoid getting into a relationship. Embarrassingly, this is what hurts me the most, when I’m lucky enough to have this sort of hurt in my life. Cue montage. Holding hands walking in the suburban nighttime, waiting for the train to pass. Then the day, hot summer, a bench in the nature preserve facing really not much except for the power lines. Her telling me every morning how adorable I am when I’m asleep in her bed. Outside of the movie theater, leaning against the back of her car, adults single and childless. What hurts is the thought that it’s probably only me who’s getting sentimental, who will remain this way. My feelings are my own responsibility. I handle them okay. I won’t burden anyone too much. 80 It was my first time ever picking up someone at an airport. It was quick and easy, and then Jonny was in the car. At the hotel in Timonium, Maryland, there’s wireless internet but it keeps being slow and then disconnecting. We eat at the Chili’s this hotel is connected to, then sit around for awhile, then get coffee at a diner, then go back to the Chili’s and have a couple of drinks, then go back to the hotel room. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, I was texting with Arden, who was on her way driving to Maine. (Whenever she says something sweet I am shocked, and then I’m hit with the sadness of my being shocked. ) 81 A belated response to a “thinking of you” text message I sent to Salma: “OMG, u r always in my thoughts—do u know what?” A second text from her: “Well u should. ” She doesn’t respond to my follow-up texts. 82 Eventually I get sick of the hotel’s wireless disconnecting on me, give up plotting how we’ll get to the festival grounds. Jonny is optimistic, doesn’t want us to have to drive and pay for parking and get caught in traffic. We take the light rail. Some other people get off at the same stop. They’re going to the same place as we are. “It’s supposed to get up to 100 degrees today,” one of them says. “I think we’re already there,” replies another. This group seems to be under the impression that a shuttle stops here, but I specifically remember the web site saying that there wouldn’t be a shuttle. “The racetrack is in this direction,” a guy tells us, “But it’s like five miles. ” Jonny and I both prefer the idea of walking over the idea of waiting for a bus that isn’t going to come. I figure we’re relying on providence at this point. Providence leads us into the slums of Park Heights… but it also guides us out from them, it must be said. We trudge forward, already drenched with sweat, following the sounds of Fountains of Wayne. We either smile at or ignore the comments of the locals along the way. We buy water from a street vendor, gulp it down, then head inside the gates. Fountains of Wayne has finished playing on the first stage by now. Another band is on the second stage and my impression is that they’re terrible, although I’m not exactly in the best of moods at this point. Jonny and I buy Gatorade and sit in chairs beneath a shade tent. Here at the Virgin Music Festival, there are (if I’m not mistaken) six water fountains where one may refill one’s water bottle. It’s about a fifteen minute wait to get to one, but the going rate for bottled water here is $3 per 20 oz. The first time I wait in line to refill my bottle, I’m just about there. I’m not really paying attention, but there’s a college-aged girl and a man maybe about forty years old in front of me. I notice that something’s wrong. Oh, wow, the girl’s fainting. The man is holding her up, a couple of other people come to her aid and lay her down. I just watch, don’t move to help, because—I don’t know—I’m bad at teamwork. She stirs, saying something like, “What? Did I just… faint?” and the medics or whatever are coming as I refill my water bottle. Meanwhile, Cheap Trick is playing “I Want You To Want Me”. I watch The Fratellis for a bit. They’re pretty good. Then I explore the grounds some more. Amy Winehouse puts on a good show, sounding soulful but looking really unhealthy. Paolo Nutini is also pretty good. I want to see the Charm City Roller Girls do their thing, but I can’t find where they are. I finally stumble across the dance tent, which probably would have seemed awesome to me except that from what I can tell it’s mostly music to do drugs to rather than any sort of music I could actually dance to. I text Jonny to find out where he is. He’s just leaving from seeing the Roller Girls. We meet up and sit again under another shade tent. “Would you mind if I left early?” he asks. I said that I would prefer to leave with him now, rather than try to get home by myself at the end of the day. (If I stayed, I would definitely be there until the end, to see Modest Mouse. ) He buys a Smashing Pumpkins shirt and we leave. We get into a cab. Jonny tells the driver where to go. “What you gonna give me for that? It’s, uh, a flat rate, $15. You gonna tip me or something?” Jonny, tired, says, “Yeah, I’ll give you $20. ” We eat at Chili’s and go back to the hotel room and we both want to nap, so then we do. 83 I open up a bottle of wine that I picked out yesterday. I tell Jonny to have at it and that I’ll be outside having a cigarette, I shouldn’t be long. I also bring my paper journal, expecting to write about the day’s events. Having a two-day pass requires me to wear a wristband overnight. A gal sitting on the bench across the one I sit on asks if I went to the concert. Then we chit-chat, maybe twenty feet apart from each other. Where am I and my friend coming from? Both originally from Massachusetts, my friend came up from Orlando, I’m staying in Philly for the Summer but I’m moving here to Baltimore. Oh, why, for a job? No, for school, doing a Master’s. Oh, where? Johns Hopkins. Really! That’s great. I think I become more interesting. I’m even more interesting when I say that I’m going for Writing. She wants to be a writer, yeah, she’s still doing her undergrad, History and German at Georgetown. She’s applied to twenty-something law schools because “that’s just what you do these days”. She speaks like an educated gal attending a good private college, then apologizes for not being articulate. Here’s me in my sloppy clothes, I don’t have a hair tie on me and was out in the sun all day, haven’t even run a brush through since I got back to the hotel and napped. She says, “I think I only was accepted to Georgetown because they needed minorities. They must have said, ‘Well, we only have four applicants who are Black, guess we’ll take all four. ’” A rather heartbreaking thing for her to say. A guy comes looking for her and puts an arm around her. (Though he’s not a boyfriend, she strongly implies. ) Talking continues, then they’re going. The guy asks what room we’re in, they’re going across the street for breakfast in the morning, maybe they’ll call and we can head over there with them? I’m surprised by the suggestion, don’t expect that it’ll happen. None of us even exchanged names. 84 I dream that a creepy, polite Christian man steals my private journal. I finally see him again and he says, “This is incredible, what you wrote in here,” holding the journal like a holy relic. He has his children smash up my car (which is the rental car I’ve been driving) using their own cars, so that when I find it, it has been crushed in at both ends. This is a Misery type situation: I’m in his house and he doesn’t want me to leave. I manage to sneak outside, trying to look at the house number so that I can call 911. “You will know nothing!” he exclaims. His wife restrains me at the armpits and somehow is lightly shocking me with electricity wherever she touches me. None of them want to hurt me too much, because they’re good Christians. 85 The first I saw anyone crowd surfing at the Virgin Festival was a little bit during Interpol’s set; then, during The Smashing Pumpkins, they went nuts. It was like it took a ’90s band being onstage for the crowd to remember that they could do that. I like bopping and getting pushed around a little, but damn. The show had its ups and downs. Fortunately today wasn’t the hundred degrees or whatever it was yesterday. It was drizzling throughout the Pumpkins’ set. 86 Drop off Jonny at the airport. Pull off the beltway to check out a town where there’s an apartment I tried calling about earlier. (I got disconnected when my phone died. ) I drive back to Philly, plug in my phone for a bit. The women I was speaking with about the apartment texted with her email address. Okay. I’m on the Internet for a short while. I have the application fee returned from the complex that didn’t have any apartments available after all, plus a paycheck from the latest temp agency I’ve been going through, for that envelope-stuffing gig. I should deposit those and do laundry. I drive to Springfield, deposit the checks at the bank there. I want to clean out the rental car before I return it tomorrow: I make cars messy and the dirt on my and Jonny’s boots from the festival is, um, all over the place. So I stop at Target, get a Dustbuster and car wipes and the cheapest air freshener they have. I also get a capo and some guitar picks while I’m there. I put laundry in the wash, then go to Panera Bread. 87 The accident that my car was in was my fault, said the insurance company. It turns out that the truth was not a “reasonable explanation” for the damage done. I start crying and hang up the phone. Then I plug it back into the charger: suddenly, the battery is nearly dead. It has only been lasting for about five hours at a time. 88 Arden drew a heart in the sand on the coast of Maine. My phone beeped several times in West Philadelphia and I received the picture. 89 Wednesday, I’ve set my cell phone to wake me up and impressively, I do, in the morning. It’s a disgusting hundred degree day. I return the rental car, walk to Suburban Station and get on the train to North Wales, reading along the way. Arden is sending pictures to my phone of where she’s sitting on the beach in Maine and imagining that I’m there. At the auto body place, I’m told that a signature is needed from Bruce—whom the guy keeps referring to as my father. Also, they can’t accept a credit card as payment. I mention that I just found out I was responsible for paying the $500 deductible. “Yeah,” he says, “I just found that out too. But you’ll be getting that back…” I say that I’m not so sure, since the insurance people are saying that I was at fault. “That’s ridiculous,” says the guy, talking about the rear end damage. He says that the appraiser they sent out to the shop should know that, too. I forward that information to my mom, who’s been in touch with the insurance agent. Tonight is the Rasputina/My Brightest Diamond show, but without a car I can’t get to Baltimore for it. I look into apartments and jobs in the suburbs around here, plus continue work on the Life Story. I do consider the Court Reporting thing again. The next morning, I don’t wake up as early as planned. I sleep in until about 1:30, walk to the Green Line Powelton for a coffee, remember that I was supposed to fax the authorization to Bruce at his work so he can sign it, walk back to Spring Garden. It’s another hot day. I get that paper, walk to the Fed Ex/Kinko’s. I send the fax. While I’m at the machine, a British man asks (seeing me soaked from the rain which has begun), “Is it refreshing to be caught in the rain when it’s such a hot day?” to which I respond, “It’s bittersweet. ” When I go to pay, the woman there says, “Eh, have a nice day. I don’t feel like bothering with this shit. ” I’m running out of time. The auto body place is supposed to close at 5:00. I realize that I forgot my checkbook, so I go to my bank and ask what should I do, get a bank check or something? A cashier’s check, the first teller I speak with suggests. I fill out a withdrawal slip and then go up to a different teller. At first, I slide the slip face-down. “Turn that the other way, please,” she says. “Oh, sorry,” I say, “I didn’t think of that. ” “If you’d had it happen to you, you would. ” It takes about fifteen minutes for the transaction to be completed. By then, Bruce has called to say that the fax didn’t come through properly; two of the pages appeared blank and another was illegible. “Okay,” I say, “I’ll send it again. ” I don’t think I’ll have time to pick up the car today: everything already has been taking longer than I hoped. Back at the copy shop, an employee fiddles with the fax machine and says, “Okay, try it now. ” A woman comes in, appears to know another customer who’s in there. “Are you here with ___?” she asks me. “No, I’m just waiting for a fax to go through. ” “Oh, okay. Well, you look like you could be a remodeler. ” At least, I think that’s what she says. I call the auto body shop. The guy says he’ll stay there late if it means I can get there to pick up the car. I walk toward the 30th Street Station. I text Bruce to see if he got and signed and sent off the paper. Yes, he did. Okay. I finally eat the doughnut that I’ve been carrying around in a plastic bag with my paper journal and book and whatnot (since I stopped at 7-11 before I sent the first fax). I buy a one-way ticket for the SEPTA rail, squat outside smoking a cigarette. At least, having gotten off the train the day before at Market East after my fruitless venture to the shop, and having bought and carried back home some cardboard boxes from Staples (boxes which the breeze kept making sway, so that it felt like I was trying to fly using one cardboard wing) I was able to pack up some of my books, emptying the bookcase and one of the dressers, both of which the guy who had been living in my room before is (from what I was told) coming to pick up today. I go back inside the terminal. Oops, this is the wrong track I’m on the escalator to—the wrong R5. In front of me is an older man, who doesn’t walk up the steps while the escalator carries him up. He’s not rushing to do all these ridiculous errands I do, errands which on their own seem gainless. Busy days take me further into debt. I wish that I were at some hippie festival, urinating in the woods. I read on the train once I’ve boarded it. I wish that I were alone in this seat, but a man is sitting next to me. I get my car and drive to the American Star Diner and eat a bacon cheeseburger with fries and drink Pepsi and smoke cigarettes and write. "

    "body": "90 Tomorrow I give a call to Orleans Tech. Not sure what to ask, exactly. Whether they have another orientation coming up, I suppose. But day or evening classes? I know that day classes move more quickly. That would be a plus. Internship is supposed to be a part of their program… 91 Or I could move to Washington state. The Court Reporting program at Green River Community College specifically offers a Captioning track. Tuition is cheap. I wouldn’t be living or going to school in a congested city. I would be in the Pacific Northwest, where the weather is less likely to make me want to jump off a bridge. The school is in Auburn—reasonably close to Seattle, where Zella is. I can see myself relaxing there. 92 I’m driving to Massachusetts when I finally get in touch with Zella. She’s like yes, yes, come here! We’ll be roommates. I’ve also been communicating with Salma, who hasn’t been responding to text messages much lately and has sounded down. Her Mama’s up visiting; Salma and one of her friends are going to take her into a bar for the first time in her life. They choose The Dirty Truth. I’m going to meet up with them if I arrive in time (which I don’t). The drive is a drive is a drive. I got used to driving the rental car, while that was all I had. I sing along to CDs, then stop singing when the traffic slows down for toll booths. I’ve been wanting to record songs, make music, but my new laptop runs Vista and there are no Vista drivers for my Tascam US-428 yet, so I’m just waiting for new technology to make possible what used to be possible before the new technology. There are a lot of toll booths along this drive. I know it hasn’t really been a long time since I’ve been back to Massachusetts, but it does feel as though it’s been. Giants Stadium lights up the clouds. It’s visible for miles. You could think that the sun hadn’t totally set, but it totally has. 93 I got to Massachusetts around quarter of one yesterday morning. It took my mom a while to be woken up by me. “Oh, I don’t need to go back to bed yet. I fell asleep around nine,” she said, sitting down on the living room couch and turning the television on. I talked to her about the Washington idea. I wasn’t really trying to convince her that it was a good idea, but in any case she said that it sounded like the best option for me, from what I was saying. She said that she’d talk to Bruce the next day. (It had been his mother’s car and all. ) 94 I meet up with Julian. Being in Northampton feels weird. We see La Vie en Rose, about the life of Edith Piaf. Then I drive him home. Zella calls and asks some questions about what I’m looking for in an apartment. “I’m still just… taken back by how random this is. It’s going to be good,” she says. Then Amelia calls, having received a text from me. I’m driving into Hadley from Sunderland at this point. She says that she and her boyfriend are going to the Basement. “What’s happening there?” I ask. “Hipsters dancing, I suppose,” she says. “Really?” I say, “They do that on Saturdays now?” “Oh! Oh, wait, it is Saturday, isn’t it? I was thinking that it was Tuesday. ” I park my car and walk to The Basement, passing Troy, who is calling to someone else—”Come to The Basement! Ella’s playing piano there!” I remember the person he’s talking about—I’ve met her a couple of times. So, I accidentally get to see her perform. She’s really good. Charlie is also there. We sit outside and smoke. He came with somebody who wanted to see the other act playing, a punkish rock band. I leave. Amelia calls just as I get to my car. I meet her and we walk around, then sit in the car for a bit. She’s offering “unwarranted, unsolicited advice”, saying that if I can, I should, you know, defer my admission into Johns Hopkins, or whatever… “I just want to be happy. I’ve been unhappy…” I end up confessing, and she one-handedly massages my neck a little. We talk about meeting up again the next day at some point. I’m also supposed to hang out with Salma. I’ll see what happens. 95 Walking two blocks from a restaurant to a bar, visiting in Northampton, I’m hanging out with Salma. We end up stopping 4 times in the course of that walk to have conversations with people we know. Two of them are people I know; two of them are people she knows. That’s just how it goes back here. At the bar, I’m reminded of one of the downsides to this—people I don’t recognize often nevertheless recognize me, and occasionally mysteriously hate me. These are always men. So Salma’s in the bathroom and a guy comes up and says, “Hey, bro, what’s going on?” I say, “Eh, not much. ” He asks, “What’s your name again?” “Levi. ” “Ah, okay. What are you up to?” “Just hanging out with my friend Salma, catching up. ” “Uh huh. ” “What’s your name again?” “None of your goddamn business. ” Then he walks away. 96 At the bar, Salma was talking about love and I was saying how I’ve come to think of it as fleeting, something you had better appreciate because no one’s actually going to make a habit of loving you, I mean, no, I’m just talking about myself and I’ve come to expect so little, I don’t think that anyone’s going to take my feelings into consideration because… I don’t know, love hasn’t been anything I’ve felt motivated to think about lately. I just want to be happy. Confused thoughts. And she said, “My Mama says that Pakistani marriage is like, you start off with a bowl of fruit, and then you add more fruit. American marriage is like, you start with an empty bowl: the romance alone doesn’t prepare you for what marriage is going to be like. ” 97 In my brain it’s like this: I’m one among a bunch of people wandering through, contending with life. Each of us is complete, always has been. We’re pure, although our strategies change. We scatter and come together. We’re points on a globe, moving, putting on jobs and relationships like outfits. She’s pretty in that profession. He’s handsome in that marriage. 98 I need to decide which state I’m going to be living in two weeks from now. I’ve spent most of the past five months stressing about this. Whatever I choose, I can’t look back after this. Do I choose: Pennsylvania? This is where I’ve been since March. My luck has been pretty bad. I have little tolerance for hot summers, even in Massachusetts, and Philly is worse. I have an interview tomorrow for a temp-to-perm position, full-time, which pays $13-$15 per hour. It’s entering data from invoices, that sort of thing, for a water filtration company. I don’t have any great support network in PA or anything, but I do know people… and of course Arden is there, sweet and chill and sane, someone I am afraid to naïvely develop feelings for. I imagine that I would live alone in the suburbs. I’m afraid that if at any point I didn’t have either a reliable source of income or someone to sleep next to at night, I would kind of end up freaking out inside my head. The Pennsylvania option feels like too many important eggs in two few uncertain baskets. Maryland? I was admitted to and am enrolled in classes at Johns Hopkins University, set to begin work on an M. A. in Writing. It’s a part-time program. I would be borrowing a lot in loans. I’ve visited and looked at apartments and would most likely live in Baltimore. I would worry about crime and feel claustrophobic. I would continue to stress myself out worrying about building my resumé. My hope would be to point myself in the direction of teaching at a community college; this pursuit might or might not be reasonable. If I finished the program (which I consider a likely but not certain outcome) there’s a good chance that I would stay in school afterward, either for an M. F. A. or a Ph. D. —keeping me in school pretty much forever. I like studying and listening to lectures, but have serious doubts about my ability to make friends. I am afraid of debt and hate competition—two facts which suggest to me that an academic career may not be something that I’m cut out for, no matter how “smart” I might be or how good a teacher. I would feel like I was writing to save my life every time I wrote. A graduate degree from JHU would make people look at me differently; it would open doors, but at what cost to my happiness? (Also, again, the summers, the heat, the heat!) Washington? The most likely. Zella is looking at two-bedroom apartments for us, south of Seattle. I would—get this—go back to community college to learn Real-time Captioning. (I could also study this in Philadelphia, but that would involve a daily commute in traffic into the city and the program would also be at, like, a trade school, which I’m kind of weird about for various reasons. ) I don’t think there’s anywhere in the country better suited for me than the Pacific Northwest. I give a thumbs up to the climate especially, but also the culture and the proximity to pretty places—Seattle, Portland, British Columbia. Tuition would be cheap, while I’d still have the leeway in my budget that loans would afford me. Having a roommate would be reasonable financially, and in this case I wouldn’t be living with strangers… Virginia? This is what my Mom thinks I should do—live with my cousin Ken, he could help me get a job while I took Court Reporting classes. But, no—he’s actually not near enough to where the school is. Amy is, I’m pretty sure, but I’d still end up having to live by myself. And Virginia is fairly low on the list of states I’d like to live in. Texas? Also low on that list. I could theoretically still enroll in classes at the University of North Texas, but I’m really only including that in my list to make it longer, to emphasize how many options I have. Aren’t I a lucky bastard? Having so many lives to choose from. Massachusetts? I don’t have any blueprints drawn up (so to speak) for moving here other than moving into Alyssa’s room in my mom’s house, getting another crappy job and every time I leave the house getting weirded out about already knowing everyone, or everyone already knowing me, or thinking that they knew about me… I would probably then hole myself up in an efficiency somewhere, and blah, and blah. 99 I call the temp agency first thing in the morning on the day when I’m supposed to have that interview. I say that I’m canceling, I’m moving from the area, I just found out, yeah. The woman doesn’t sound very happy about all that. I am a turd-burger. I spend several days in Massachusetts seeing no one, mostly just alternating between watching television and driving around alone with my thoughts. Finally it’s Friday morning and I’ve made plans to head over to Arden’s place at 8 PM and I’m putting things in the car (already I’ve cleaned it out and put my keyboard, keyboard stand and guitar amp in the trunk) and I’m putting my guitars on the floor of the back of the car and Zella isn’t exactly the most stable person I know, but I can’t see her doing anything in this situation that would mess with my life too badly. Mostly I’m nervous about driving cross-country in the Saturn with all the possessions I really care about left inside my car. 100 Today it feels absolutely stupid for me not to do my Master’s. The apartment Zella looked at yesterday was “not the place” for us, but she has two more she’s looking at today. At the auto body shop, Doug (oh, so that’s why it’s called Doug’s North Wales Auto Repair) said that the piece didn’t come in. He’d put in the order but yeah, then forgot about it. I asked whether he’d mind if I gave the insurance company his number to discuss the damage, since they’re still trying to pin the fault on me. “Absolutely,” he said, reiterating that “that’s ridiculous”. I drive to Borders, get lost looking at a picture book of remote locations, then buy Still Life with Woodpecker by Tom Robbins, which looks like it will be a quick and fun read. Yeah, I think I’m going to end up in Washington, but today I can’t believe it. I think of how I love to read, love to write and how I’ll have to deal with the question of employment no matter where I go, and what would be so bad about doing more degrees after this? Even if I go to Washington, I can see myself wanting to do a Master’s eventually, anyway. What’s silly is that if that apartment I applied to had indeed been available, I’m sure that I would be going, for better or for worse. That Johns Hopkins I. D. I carry around would be more than just a funny thing to keep in my wallet, more than just a token of a slightly interesting story. Community college? What the hell is wrong with me? I want to write! But that’s the thing: I have to do more than just write. What I’m doing is choosing for myself what to do when not writing, instead of taking for granted what life a writer is supposed to live. Oh, well. Oh, well. I remember that my first stint at community college was what introduced me to people—interesting people, creative people—and that’s one major thing I’m afraid that I would lack in Baltimore. I can see myself having multiple heads from the perspective of my classmates. You might say that I’m insecure, sitting in my car in a parking lot in North Wales, Pennsylvania, about six in the morning, time having passed. I ended up visiting Arden and getting the key to her place while she finished the shift and then went out to the bar with co-worker and the people who had looked after her place while she was on vacation. I have a coffee from Wawa. Waiting for her on Friday and then in spare moments on Saturday I read her copy of the first volume of Maus. Yesterday at my suggestion we watched Breakfast at Tiffany’s in the morning, went to the American Star Diner, napped (I for longer then she) and during dinner and wine watched an Ani DiFranco DVD, I forget what it’s called, the one from around 2001. The first place Zella looked at on Friday, at a place called Kentbrook in Kent, is according to her “absolutely amazing”. They want me to fill out my own application. There’s a fireplace and a deck, it’s on the top floor, there’s a view, rent would be $420 each. Arden and I go to Gettysburg. We walk around the cemetery and battlefield. It’s drizzly—such a refreshing change from the stifling heat. We were at the Appalachian Brewing Company there when she finally asked, “So are you going to tell me where you’re going?” and I told her about Washington. I don’t understand her. She has helped me. Although I do like the feeling of staring at an atlas and considering the various routes I might take, the prospect of moving so far away from family and from everyone I know on this coast is… rather sad. Arden’s seeming excited for me has helped. I hope and figure that I’ll feel like I’m doing something out there, like I have a purpose. I don’t want to just wander around being all doom and gloom. On Monday I wake up craving coffee something terrible. I couldn’t quite crawl out of bed, I think, being pulled back by inviting arms and now I remember being sort of weird, feeling very weird, not knowing the polite way to make coffee happen but it was all that I could think about. Probably, it’s more the idea of the thing that gets me. Like I’m insecure about my ability to be awake without coffee. My worry du jour is the question of what living with Zella would be like. I wouldn’t worry if we weren’t going to share a lease, which presumably we would. What’s up? It’s like I’m living never in the now, only jumping back and forth between scary potential realities. How did I get lost here? Alice was texting me last night while I was having an actually quite nice conversation with Arden, very straightforward and it started when I asked, “So what do you like about me? I think it’s been a couple of weeks since I asked that question” and “You might want to look into sublets and temporary housing just in case,” Zella advises me via text message. I’m in Philly, sitting in front of the Green Line Powelton with a cup of coffee and smoking cigarettes. “Why do you say that?” I text back. I wait for a response. As happens sporadically, my eye-rolling tic comes back and I can’t resist it. Farewell, Johns Hopkins. Although I like the idea of being in advanced classes, workshopping, being given assigned readings—I do love assigned readings—aren’t I pretty certain that I’ll never have a truly competitive C. V. , at least not if I begin now and have to deal with my anxieties and all of that? Shouldn’t this be fine? Shouldn’t I be willing to just move to Washington on my own? I am. Eventually, hours later, Zella responds: “Hope for the bet, prepare for the worst. ” At the Fed Ex/Kinko’s on Market Street, the Basic PC Workstation is down. I could use the only slightly more expensive Design Workstation instead, but of course I’m still trying to think. This is how it’s been: I could do something now, but no… I just need to think a little bit more. I spend a lot of time driving (to a different Fed Ex/Kinko’s far away) and sitting in the car, while it’s raining outside. (Pretty, I think to myself. ) Finally I send the fax to Johns Hopkins to drop my classes. The Fall semester at Green River Community College doesn’t start until the 24th of September. That’ll give me some time to settle in… I like that. I spoke with someone from the program; that was good. I called my mom to say hey. She said that she just got off the phone with my aunt, Kim, who thinks it’s ridiculous for me to be going so far. I can’t really deny that. According to my Mom, everyone in the family thinks that I should do something relating to computers, because I’m on the Internet all the time. On Tuesday I decide to drive up to North Wales and to try driving around until I can find somewhere to get an alignment done. I quickly lose hope and go to Borders. I look at travel books. I text Arden to ask if she knows where I take my car. Pep Boys, she says, near the Borders that I was at the other day. (She doesn’t know that Borders is exactly where I am again. ) I call the place and they say that they’ll do it today. I drop off the car and walk to a Starbucks. My mom calls. “Cheryl’s getting that feeling again. ” I don’t know what she’s talking about. Apparently, the last time she got this feeling, it preceded my getting in the car accident. She also had a feeling before that, which had preceded some other bad fortune on my part? Arden and I get pizza, drink beer, talk and go to bed early. She’s going to be pretty busy this weekend. The auto body place says that the part to my car should be in on Thursday; I’m saying tentatively that my departure will probably happen on Friday morning. After Arden leaves for work on Wednesday morning, I finish reading Maus. I don’t hang around in her apartment for very long after that. I head out to the same Starbucks I went to the day before. I do Life Story things. My hand and wrist is hurting, so of course I have the thought of hey, what if it’s carpal tunnel, wouldn’t that ruin your hopes for what you’re moving to Washington for study? I quickly shoo that thought away. 101 Thursday. The part indeed arrived for the car. It was just some little plastic thing that snapped onto the front. I had considered writing out some statement for the repair guy to sign, something saying that there’s no fucking reason for the insurance adjuster to be claiming that I’m at fault. So last night, yeah, it was me and Arden and her newly-bought DVD of the tenth season of South Park. One glass each of tequila on the rocks. Today has been hanging around in her apartment, coming and going as I please (she told me that I could leave the door unlocked) and she stopped by when she needed to make a bank run, dropped off the application for an apartment in Washington (an application faxed to Arden’s workplace from Zella’s workplace) and alone I stared at the application. I took hours considering what to write, doing something else and then returning to it. It’s staggering how far beyond kind and helpful this woman has been to me. Now I have to ask myself: do I try to start driving tomorrow? Probably not. I’d say that I should leave on Saturday morning. I should go to the post office in Philly and get my mail forwarded… etc. etc. 102 On Friday, August 22, 2007, I load up the car with all my things from the apartment, then spend one last night with Arden.

    "body": "7 In the evening I take a very small number of my possessions via train and trolley and move into the room in West Philly/University City. I pay a half month’s rent for the rest of April, plus August’s rent in advance. The room is drafty—very drafty—and I’m alone. I have met one of my new roommates, ever so briefly. The other I haven’t met at all. Neither of them are at home. I have a chair, so I sit in it and call Salma, just in case she answers. She does. We talk. Then I call Julian. We talk. I lie down. Before coming here I spent the day working. The night before, I got tipsy and danced. I forgot to bring a pillow and blanket here. It’s so cold. The roommates come home, drunk. “Usually it’s only me who’s drunk,” says one of them, who is named Owen. The other one is named Joe. I borrow a thing that does the job as a pillow, plus a blanket. I wrap the blanket around me, tucking myself in as tightly as possible from feet to neck because I’m shivering. I didn’t bring any food. My tummy rumbles. This is exactly what I wanted. 8 On Sunday I manage to buy some food. I do not manage to buy a blanket or pillow. I have a confusing online chat with Julian. 9 My alarm wakes me up at 4 in the morning on Monday. I’m wearing my coat already: I’m shivering. It’s just a matter of getting my shoes on and walking out the door… …into a wintry mix of precipitation blown around by gusts of wind. Hardly anyone else is out. I have not found a coffee maker in the house, so to Wawa it is. It’s a turn-around-when-the-wind-is-bad-just-so-you-can-breathe sort of morning. My black pants are soaked through until they look like a wetsuit. Subway to station to bus. The power is out at the store and remains so all morning. We leave early, about three and a half hours later, when the power has still not been restored and the backup lights are beginning to fade. Instead of going directly home I take the subway to the Gallery and at K-Mart buy a pillow and blanket. I want to take the commuter rail out to Morton to get the rest of my clothes and other things, but service along the R3 has been suspended and we’re advised to find alternate transportation. Now, having two blankets to warm me, I lie on the mattress with my laptop. I fall asleep to a video stream of Al Jazeera English. 10 My alarm doesn’t go off on time. I recognize later that I had set it to sound on the wrong day. I’m lucky, then, to wake up in time to get to work. Another nine hours pass. I take the bus to Morton, say hello, while I’m there do my clothes at the laundromat down the street, gather my things together and go back into the city, back to the apartment, shower, go online and check but don’t respond to messages. Bluejay, with whom I met up the last time I passed through Philly, whom I originally met when they were a taxi driver out in Boston, has said that they and their boyfriend Rob would pick me up so that we could hang out for a bit tonight. That happens. We sit in their apartment in South Philly and talk pleasantly, mostly about the city and things to do here and how I might go about looking for jobs and for which jobs I should look. We stop at the Wawa that I’m already in the habit of visiting every morning. The city seems friendlier now, and more exciting. Get this: they lend me a space heater! I go back into my room and it feels warmer than it’s been. The space heater tells me that it’s 51 degrees inside. But you’ll change that, now won’t you, space heater? 11 Then I sleep through my cell phone alarm and figure that I’m probably going to be fired. I walk to buy a coffee at the Wawa, but the Wawa is closed due to a power outage. I walk down to Cereality, get my coffee there. I’m smoking the last cigarette of the pack as I call up my manager. He asks me when I can come in. I say after lunch break. Online, I try to apply to another job, but before I can finish I have to leave to catch the train to catch the bus. Riding the El above West Philly, listening to Year Zero, the new album from Nine Inch Nails. Franklin gave me the burned copy that somebody else gave him and said that he hated it: “It’s all you, man. ” But it’s moving to me, at least up here, looking down at trash and broken windows. I keep getting the impulse to wish that I could clean up the litter—as if the trouble I’m looking at is really about litter. The bus gets me to the shopping center early. I’ve forgotten to eat, so I get a breakfast sandwich at the bagel place. The place is starting to look like a pet supply store now. Even the birds, fish, and small pets have arrived. They’re spinning in wheels, flying out of their cages, floating dead. I walk around, setting up signs that hang in the aisles. The manager, Dan, calls me to the front to introduce me to the person who’ll be training me to be a Pet Training Instructor. I’m surprised: I had been guessing that they had given up on really, actually letting me train for that instead of just having me do grunt work. But now that I’ve been putting in such a lackluster performance as one who lifts boxes and merchandises shelves I’m insecure about my ability to do anything for this company. (Although clearly, my brain reasons, if I were to work for a different employer—an employer who has not seen me become the zombie that I am after a full-time week of doing this sort of work—I would be able to put on a fresh face and, feeling comfortable, not worrying about anyone thinking ill of me, I could excel at any job I might be given, even if it were, as in the position of Pet Training Instructor, unrelated to any of the many things I have done for work or studied. ) If I could come in on one of my days off, it is suggested to me by Dan, I might get a jump on my book training. I should be able to do Friday, I say. (I forget that I left my training book at Alice and Franklin’s. ) “I won’t write you on the schedule, just in case something gets in the way of your coming in. ” After five hours the people who were running the show during the day have left. I’m confused. Some people are training to work as cashiers, while others are training to feed fish. I haven’t had a break in a few hours. Since I’m not working the times when I was scheduled anyway, I figure I can leave whenever I want to. So, that’s when I leave. I have to run across the street to the bank, either to see if a check has cleared or to deposit something, or… I really don’t know. Then I’m hoping to find somewhere to buy cigarettes and coffee. I walk down the street until I find a little store that sells me cigarettes. I walk into the KFC/Taco Bell, thinking to myself that they probably don’t have coffee, but, you know, maybe they do, so it’s worth it to try. Once I’m there the smell gets into my brain and I decide that I could buy a little something. The line is moving very slowly. I stand and wait. I stand and wait. Maybe I’ll buy more than a little something. Maybe I’ll buy a meal! I stand and wait. I stand and wait. No, I’m sick of waiting. I walk back to the shopping center where I work, thinking about how bad an addict I am, even though it’s only cigarettes and coffee. I sit at the bus stop for a minute, but I’m thirsty too. Now I want caffeine and hydration. Walking in front, none of these stores seem like they sell soda, and the bagel shop is closed. But, wait! The home electronics store! I figure they probably have a little soda fridge. They do. I pick out a lemonade and a Dr. Pepper. I stand and wait. I stand and wait. There is a woman in front of me looking just as exasperated as I am. Everyone in front of the us is getting computer repairs done or something else that is taking an incredible amount of time for the one cashier to process. I stand and wait. I stand and wait. Finally someone opens up a small register that is hidden elsewhere in the store: “Anyone who just has items to ring up, you can head over in this direction!” I and the woman walk over, but some other guy goes in front of us first. And he’s paying with a card. “Okay, I’ll be right back. I just have to run to the front of the store to put this through…” says the employee. I finally look to the woman in front of me and smile in disbelief: “I’m just thirsty!” holding up my two twenty-ounce soft drinks in their plastic bottles. “And me,” she says, “I’m just buying a gift card. ” Then I sit and wait for the bus. I transfer to the train. A man with a suitcase says he’s selling DVDs. 12 Since I was just going to do book work today at Petsmart and my training book is in Morton, and since I wasn’t actually on the schedule for today, I don’t bother going. I’ve set up an appointment with a temp agency at 3 o’clock. My two major tasks for the day are to go to that appointment and then also to buy some pants, because my pants keep ripping. I need to figure out how to get to the agency office. This would be easy enough if the Internet weren’t randomly refusing to work. Stupid Internet. So, fine, I get my coffee and breakfast at a wireless hotspot. I have an email regarding a low-paying (but no lower-paying than my current gig—and much more wonderfully sedentary, it must be said!) data entry project. I call the number provided, ask for extension such-and-such, when someone answers I mumble, blah blah blah data entry and get directed to the voicemail of someone who was not the person who emailed me. So I email back (mentioning this phenomenon) with my resume attached. Having plotted out when to leave to get to the (rather distant) agency office, I walk back to the apartment. Then, what do I do? Why am I writing down all these details? Aren’t there better things I could be doing with my time? Aren’t there better things I could be doing with my time? Aren’t there better things I could be doing with my time? No. Okay, so I remember getting home after the walk. And mind you, I was in a sweater today. I hope to retire that raggedy old coat once and for all, with the seasons changing. So I remember… shaving! Yes, I shave my face with the electric razor. After briefly encountering one of my roommates, what’s his name? Owen. He’s on his way to class. And I ask him when the garbage collection is and he says on Monday and I can just put my trash in the can out back on Sunday night. Also, he says there’s a laundromat like one block away. Then it’s a long train ride and a long bus ride. The interview is painless, even though I’m not dressed for it because I have no clothes. I mentioned call center work when I filled out the online thingie, but during the interview I confide that I would love to do data entry, and she says okay, I can email you a program to test your typing speed and I’m like, yes! (I just downloaded one myself not too long ago, for fun. I test at… let’s see what I test at right now. 16,700 kph. ) I hop on the El at Frankford and the car I’m sitting in is flooded with schoolchildren. They are loud, very loud. I sit and try to focus on reading Gulliver’s Travels. I only manage to read like one chapter. By the time we’re approaching Center City they’re asking a substitute teacher questions about drugs. She’s trying to answer honestly, so that when they ask, “Do you have to take a drug test to be a teacher?” she replies, “No, not to be a substitute. ” Then they get her to talk about what drugs she did when she was younger. “Acid?” asks one of the kids. Nodding, the teacher says, “I did a lot of things. ” “I hear that it doesn’t go away, that it stays in you forever. Is that right?” and so on. The teacher talks about how lucky she is, how a lot of her friends found themselves caught up in a drug user’s lifestyle. “Eventually it just got old and I wanted to do something more,” she says. When I emerge near the Gallery shops, the guy I sent the resume to this morning has left me a voicemail. I try to call him back, but he’s not there. I leave a voicemail saying, “So if you could call me back… again… sometime, that’d be… good” because what else am I going to do? It’s Friday afternoon. I get home and poke around at the Internet. Bluejay texts me to ask if I want to go to Sex Dwarf, an ’80s dance night. I say yes, even though I have work in the morning. I never understood wanting to be fired before. I get ready to go. I hear what sounds like an ice cream truck driving by, although it’s 9:40 PM. 13 Beers are two dollars! I have five. While I’m inside, Salma responds to a text message that I sent earlier in the night. I step outside for a smoke, try calling her, leave a message. I go back inside and dance, then head out again when I see that she’s left a voicemail. “Your message was sweet,” Salma’s message says. I smile. Meanwhile, a woman I don’t know has sat down near to me. Figuring that she’s going to talk to me, I turn to her. “So what’s your story?” I ask, snapping shut my phone. She immediately slides next to me so that our shoulders are touching. We talk for a bit. I’m looking mostly at South Street, rather than at her. She’s forty-one years old and from North Haven, Connecticut. “I should get back inside and dance some more,” she says. “Do it, then!” I say. “Okay,” standing up and turning around, “Give me a push and I’ll go. ” I push her shoulder lightly. She goes. I open my cell phone and call back Salma. She answers this time. 14 “Salma, I’d still love you if you completely lost it,” I tell her after listening to some of what’s on her mind. “Oh, you say that now. ” 15 “Pretty in Pink” is the theme of the ’80s night. It’s a crowded, high-energy dance floor. Racially it’s very white. I dance a lot by myself. Near the end of the night, Bluejay and Rob and I are all sitting. I’m deleting old text messages while Bluejay is on the Internet using their Sidekick. We leave when the club closes at 2 AM. I fall asleep immediately and set my alarm for 5 AM. 16 I awake at 5:45, realizing that the alarm on my cell phone must have been going off for forty-five minutes. How annoying for anyone awake! I try to catch the El but find that instead of a train, I need to take an El Shuttle bus to the 69th Street Station. I have no idea why they’re not running the trains, but okay. Now I’m going to be late by fifteen minutes or so. I rehearse in my head how I’m going to walk into the store and quit (and leave with my paycheck). When I finally arrive, the manager, Dan, says, “Good morning, Levi. Punch in and help this guy here move the file cabinets. ” I do as instructed, then remain in the store for the rest of the ten-hour training day. The next day is my birthday. I do not go into work. 17 I get taken out for my birthday. Bluejay picks me up, we pick up Rob, then we pick up two folks it’s my first time meeting, Mindy and Jim. Off to a diner we go! And we eat. And the conversation is upbeat and enjoyable. Then there is cake! Wonderful chocolate mousse cake! The next day I interview for a position on a temporary data entry project. The interview goes well, and I test at about twice what they’re asking. Then I get a call saying that after all that, oh, wait, the client really needs to see on-the-job experience. This all bums me out. I call my mom. “It’s not you. It’s the world,” she says. I visit Alice and Franklin and P. (and Marquis de Sade, the cat). By around 9 at night I’m walking home from the train, text messaging with Salma. She calls me after she gets out of work, talks about herself, what she thinks is wrong with herself, tries to turn the conversation to me (but I turn it back to her), tells me about her brother’s having guided Salman Rushdie around Boston, and why it’s hard for her when she and Janelle fight. Then I’m on the phone with Jonny, who is still in Orlando and working as a freelance A/V tech. He’s planning to buy me a ticket to the Virgin Festival in Baltimore, where The Smashing Pumpkins will be playing. Then I’m chatting with a stranger on OKCupid. 18 In the morning I get a call from the Philadelphia Zoo. I’m supposed to go in for an interview with them on Friday. I spend all day online. I’m chatting with a gal named Emily. She’s originally from Pennsylvania and finishing up college in Rochester. 19 I wake up in the morning. I’m lying still on my back for a while. Then I’m sitting up and checking up my email. I probably only had like six cigarettes yesterday. I spent most of my time editing old LiveJournal entries into a cohesive narrative, which I’m referring to as the Life Story. It’s noon. The only things I have to do today are to deposit a check at the bank and… well, I really need a coffee right now. Also, I’ll apply to more jobs… and edit my Life Story some more. 20 An occasionally drizzly, overcast day. Sure I’m a college graduate! But I interviewed at the zoo this morning, answering questions posed to me by a woman who seemed, like everybody else in this city right now except for me, to have a cold. As I was leaving, the thought occurred to me that someone should give her soup. Then I walked back to the apartment, thinking about this idea—giving someone soup because they have a cold—over and over again, from different angles. 21 I found a twenty dollar bill on the sidewalk this morning. I passed by it at first, thinking that maybe it was just some coupon masquerading as a bill. Or maybe there was a camera hidden nearby, and when I tried to grab it, somebody holding it by a string would pull the thing away before I could claim it. But, no. It was just a twenty dollar bill on the sidewalk. Then I went for a second interview at the zoo, which was quick and easy. "

    "body": "22 I’ve decided that now would be a good time to visit Massachusetts, to get some more of my stuff and to be around people. I’ve got an hour before the last Amtrak leaves from Philadelphia toward Springfield. I get things together and speed-walk to the station. I don’t need to talk to anyone: I press buttons on a touch-screen, swipe a credit card, and my ticket is printed. There’s no designated seat to find on the train. I sit and read, then I pull out my laptop and edit my memoirs and journal entries. I’m afraid but optimistic, I keep telling myself. I think that I can not be crazy. That I can be beautiful, more than a passerby to those I encounter. That I can see doctors and dentists… that I can be forgiven for sickness and look presentable. That I can not be a burden to my family. I am optimistic, having so much to gain. I am so optimistic that I am terribly afraid. 23 Get to Mom’s house and immediately borrow the car, off to meet Salma and Lyric in Northampton. In front of Hugo’s, there they are. I’m ecstatic. Hugs! Conversation drifts immediately. No one topic. Show the pendant I bought from someone on or around South Street while Alyson was down, visiting, exploring the city she wants to live in, when we were going around to all of the little shops there. Overwhelming to be here and among friends. It’s like my heart’s going to explode. “Salma! You’re beautiful!” I say. Smoking out front, “I love that I’m standing around outside at night and it feels safe!” Then we’re inside. Oh, I’m confident. Ready to keep these good times rolling. One drink for each of us. Midway through, it’s last call. Where’s open until 2? I want a second drink before we go, inevitably, to the Whately Diner. “Tully’s?” I say, it just occurring to me, but speaking the name as though it’s an obvious choice. “I thought you didn’t like going to Tully O’Reilly’s,” says Lyric. (Bad associations with Alix. ) “No, it’s fine,” I say. In fact, the two of them kind of laugh at the music once we’re there, the top 40 dance stuff, and I say, “No, I like it!” because right now I like everything. Lyric has been taking pictures from the start… when we’ve left the bar I see them displayed on the little screen of her digital camera. Then we’re off to the diner! Salma is a lightweight, so I drive. “Isn’t that Zella’s friend, Amelia?” asks Lyric. “Where?” I ask. “Outside. ” So it is! She sees us through the diner window and walks inside. I explain that I’m in town for a visit. She’s trying to figure out where her boyfriend went. She’s had a few drinks. She sits down at our table and we start talking and just blab and blab. It’s nice, although Lyric and Salma are in the position of being the people at a table who, left out of an enthusiastic conversation between two others, quietly talk to each other while feeling a little annoyed. Amelia tells me that Zella is in town—wow! I had forgotten that she was visiting Massachusetts. It’s been over a year since she suddenly moved to Olympia, Washington after suddenly moving to the Boston area. We’re introduced to Amelia’s boyfriend, a bouncer at the Pearl Street Nightclub, who sits down for a while and then wanders away. We drop Salma off at her car, making plans for the next night. After getting home, I have a long dream that I’m working in Springfield, Massachusetts but not doing very well. I’m helping to set up what seems to be a mall. I have lots of co-workers. We work late. After my shift is over I still hang around a bit, talk to some co-workers. But then I’m going to leave, and I realize that several of us are up at the top of a twisty slide. So my only way down is go to down the twisty slide, sliding by some of my co-workers. One of them in particular gets frustrated by me when I do this. “I knew that we should have fired him,” I hear them say as I’m leaving. In this mall that’s being built there is also an operating snack bar. Some friends come by and I’m supposed to eat with them, but I take a really long time deciding what I want to eat and I lose track of where they are and they eventually leave. Then I’m outside, walking the dark streets to where I think I parked. As I walk, three people of different ages, who look like they’re pretending to be a family but don’t convince me, are asking for something. They let the girl among them, who’s probably a teenager, who’s wearing a tee shirt, do the talking for them. I say that I have to keep walking. “I almost would have” trusted them and tried to help with what they were asking, I tell them, “But there was something in the approach” that made me uneasy. Clearly they were new at whatever scam they were pulling. I stop in at a convenience store. In different aisles various people are threatening each other and demanding money, using broken beer bottles. It’s escalating, a riot. Strangely, no one is going after the convenience store employees, who are just standing behind the counter. I have to squeeze by these hold-ups quickly, want to get out before someone comes after me. I’m wearing my winter coat. I make a mess of a couple of shelves of product, maybe knock over a display rack, as I scurry out. When I’m outside I notice that I’ve stolen a thing or two. I reach for a cell phone, hoping to call somebody for help, somebody who could give me a ride out of this violence. But I can’t find my own phone. I can only find stolen phones in my pockets, still in their packages—one, then another, then another. I realize that I parked nearer to where I was working than I had thought. I need to turn around and backtrack. But I’ve also started to lose my sense of direction. “Hey,” an old man is coming after me, reaching into his pocket, clearly a threat. I stick my hand into the deep pockets of my own coat and pull out something that resembles a small knife, although, next to all the other things in my pockets, I’m not sure whether it is or not. Before he can get close to me or make his threat, I’ve pointed this thing from my pocket at him and yelled, “Fuck off!” He steps back and says, “Wow, boy! I didn’t know you had the fight in ya. ” His friends, from various angles, had been coming at me from different angles, ready to jump me. But he calls them off. They stand in a line and let me pass. They are all older, Caucasian men, most of them wearing scraggly beards. More than one of them has a hook for a hand. They look like fishermen, but I know that they’re decorated war veterans. I continue to walk forward with my head down. The man wishes me well or compliments me. “Thank you, sirs,” I say politely, walking forward. Waking up to Zella calling. I guess Amelia must have talked to her? She’s walking from Meadow’s place to the center of town, gonna be wandering, let’s meet up! I tell her to give me a bit so that I can wake up. It always takes me some time to wake up, especially following a sleep like this. Maybe I can after all (or maybe I’m just starting to) understand when people say that they can’t really sleep as well as they used to until they’re comfortable with the room they’re in. I was comfortable sleeping at Alice and Franklin’s, but the sleep that I’ve just had back here at my mom’s place is making me think that in Philadelphia I haven’t quite been sleeping as deeply, as refreshingly as usual. I get a coffee at Haymarket, sit on a bench outside. I’ve started talking with Memphis when Zella approaches. She looks alive; that’s good. I suggest the Bluebonnet Diner for food. She says that sounds great. They’re closed for some reason, though, so we go to Whately. She talks about her new life on the west coast and what music she’s been listening to. I’ve been in touch with Julian via text message. Zella and I drive to pick him up. I get out of the car and hug him. He gets in the back seat. “Have the two of you met?” I ask, trying to remember. “Yes, once, at one of Britta’s parties. ” “Oh, that’s right!” and it’s all coming back to me, us all sort of having cuddled next to the kitchen window one night. We go to the Hampshire Mall, lacking any other ideas. Inside, I point to where the DDR machines are. “Yes!” says Julian. “What?” says Zella. “Dance Dance Revolution,” I say. “Oh, no, no,” says Zella, “I have never watched a game of that played and I would like to keep it that way. See, I come from, like, a Grand Theft Auto household. We don’t play dancing games. ” But we convince her to watch, at least. Back to Northampton, Zella wants to get beer at a liquor store and then go back to Meadow’s, so we part ways. Julian and I walk around the block, then again around the same block. Kelsey has plans right now but maybe if I’m still out and about later tonight… Britta is on her way to study at Haymarket with Daisy, so we wait there. Britta looks exhausted, Daisy restrained. What an odd pair they are. Britta invites me to her undergraduate thesis presentation at Smith College the next day—later than I was planning to stay in Massachusetts, but, well, maybe. Julian and I leave. He has previously suggested hanging out at Gayge’s place, so I figure that this would be a good way to kill some time before I drop off Julian and meet with Salma again. He presses the buzzer and down comes Lydia, who is living with Gayge. Lydia gives Julian some Asian pornographic magazines, “as requested”. We comment on the pictures in the magazines for a bit, play music from Gayge’s iTunes. Julian plays with Gayge’s hair a bit, then plays with mine, then Gayge is at the computer and it’s just me cuddling with Julian. “Want to get a slice of pizza with me?” I ask. Julian says sure and Gayge agrees. Lydia dances in: she rarely seems to walk, but rather floats or dances, dashes or creeps. “Did, uh, you park in the lot here? Because somebody’s trying to get into their space. ” I go outside. It turns out that my parking in space #10 made the people in apartment #10 park in space #9. So when the tenants of apartment #9 wanted to park, they were pissed off that their spot was taken. I drive out, try calling Julian but accidentally call his home number instead of his cell. “Hello?” Ellie, his fiancée, answers. “Is Julian there?” “No, he’s not. May I take a message?” “No, that’s okay. Thank you, bye. ” I turn the car around, find Julian and Gayge outside of the apartment complex, ready to go. We get pizza, then I say that I need to drop off Julian soon, if he’s planning to get a ride with me (which, he is). I drop him off. Our goodbye is of reasonable length, not extended. I’m still feeling a bit awkward in my mood as I drive to meet Salma. Inside the Dirty Truth, I’m actually more awkward than ever. Salma wanted fries, but the kitchen’s closed. She just has water. It’s just one beer for me, then. I hug her and talk about being lonely. We go outside and sit on a bench. She’s telling me that I’m not the only friend she has who spends most of their time alone. We sit in my car and she keeps talking about Julian. To Salma, Julian is in love with me. That’s not love, I say. I felt like Julian was being so possessive when he came out and said to Salma and Lyric, while I was in the bathroom at the Whately Diner that one night, that he was madly in love with me. That’s not love… I’m not saying that it couldn’t be. I just don’t think that it is right now. “We’re always going to be friends!” Salma says, and it makes me so glad. We part ways with a long and not particularly awkward hug. Kelsey texts me just then. It’s about 1:30 AM. I have plans to go to Lyric’s new place, where she lives with Daniel, in Easthampton. So, it ends up being Kelsey and Lyric and I sitting around and talking about politics. I tell Kelsey that her convictions and sense of humor make her the heir apparent to the recently deceased Kurt Vonnegut (with whom Salma, incidentally, once took a class). I sleep. I’ve set my alarm to wake me up in time for Britta’s presentation. I wake up, get ready, text Kelsey. Pick her up, we meet somebody I don’t know there and find the room where the presentations are happening. It’s three Fine Arts presentations—slides of the students’ work with background and explanations, plus Britta’s Art History thesis. When all the students have finished Kelsey turns around and is talking to Julian, whom I didn’t even know was there. Next there is some standing around in the hallway. Free water and crackers and cheese and strawberries. There’s a little bit of standing around outside—mostly me talking to Julian—but then I remember that I didn’t put change in the parking meter. I drop off Kelsey, drive home, spend a little bit of time writing and such before leaving to (as it turns out) drive to Philadelphia. I hear through the text-vine that it’s a busy night of karaoke at Packards in Northampton. Julian’s there, of course. Meanwhile, I (having lost my eyeglasses after they broke while I was staying at Alice and Franklin’s) miss a turn on the highway at night, just as I’m getting to New York City. I’m trying to check maps. Lyric calls. We’re talking as I’m discovering that I’m on the Long Island Expressway. When I end up in Manhattan, I ask if I can call her back. “I’ve never been so happy to see New Jersey before!” I say to her once I’ve made it there. She says that she had tried waking up Daniel to see if he could call a friend of his who lives in New York, to get me a place to stay. “Well, I wasn’t looking for a place to stay,” I tell her, “I was just trying to get out. I’m definitely driving to Philly tonight. ” Any conversation that I’ve had, it’s a regret of mine that I can’t report it in full. I feel that I would be able, if every last word were transcribed and archived, to understand the feelings that I have—feelings for each person different from feelings for each other person, although we can’t actually isolate personality differences, not really, we can only feel certain that we perceive them. We try to justify after the fact why… we say that we can predict… but really we just know which attitudes we are comfortable adopting around a person. (I let my guard down around you and therefore you’re trustworthy. I tense up around you and therefore you’re sketchy. ) Or maybe we do try to be scientific. Maybe we have a research grant. What then? It doesn’t help us suck at life any less. We still hate the people trying to disprove us. Then someone takes a new angle, puts human emotion on the X rather than the Y axis and suddenly we’re confused again and want to hug and/or mutilate somebody. Would my time be better spent researching? How many hours wasted chronicling my life? But I feel more fulfilled when I do this. “What you need to find is intimacy,” Lyric said. “Intimacy?” I wasn’t sure what she was talking about. “Erik Erikson. ” “Ah. ” “Yes, Alix and I both… subscribe to him. ” (Lyric and I were going back and forth; she was calling me arrogant again. ) I say that I don’t understand her, still. How I’m constantly surprised by what she says. “Well, then you probably never will understand me, if you don’t by now,” she says. But then she says, “It’s becoming a problem,” about her brain. I hang up suddenly, having been passed by two police cruisers, when the one that just passed me is pulling over and I shouldn’t be driving at all, technically my license isn’t even valid if I’m not wearing corrective lenses. So I’m not going to talk on a cell phone anymore, even though I’ve already been doing it for the past two hundred miles. It’s some ridiculous hour once I’m back in Philly. I find a parking space a couple of streets south of the apartment. I’ve been noticing that the car door has been sticking when I close it and finally, as I open it for the last time before returning home, the top of the part of the outside of the car that’s between the front and rear driver’s side doors pops off. I try to stick it back on, but to no avail. I slam the door such that at least it closes and locks. My Mom has sent in the mail my ATM card and checkbook for my account here in Philadelphia, which Sovereign Bank mistakenly sent to my permanent address there in Massachusetts. That was, however, about a week ago and it should have arrived by now. The Proust biography that I ordered through Amazon is already here; somebody took it from the floor of the porch (where mail for both apartments of the house gets left) and leaned it against the wall of the hallway inside. Also in the missing package were my last two paychecks from the Cumberland Farms in Granby and a birthday check from my father. I return to my room. Everything’s there. I still don’t know my roommates. I have to pay rent tomorrow. Lyric calls back. We talk a little more. I go to sleep… …and when I hear one of my roommates walking up the stairs several hours later, I gather up the $415 and say to him, “Hey, do you want the rent money?” So, that’s taken care of. I return to the car and have a $26 parking ticket. It turns out that around here it’s two hour parking only during the day if you don’t have a resident sticker. How stupid am I for not even thinking about that! "

    "body": "Last night I brought in my guitar, some pillows, some other stuff. This morning I drive the car to a space on my street (Spring Garden) and unload my microphone and some clothes, which I had stashed in the trunk. I don’t even remember where I got my morning coffee. I buy American Doll Posse, the new Tori Amos CD, at the Penn Bookstore, which I hadn’t before noticed also sells CDs. Then I walk to Sovereign Bank. I sit and wait to talk to someone (after walking, “one person at a time” through the doors that must, I don’t know what they do, but you wait for the door behind you to close and then the light on the next door turns green and you can walk through. ) The guy who helps me is nice, closes out my old accounts and opens a new one for me. (I’ve received a call extending a job offer at the zoo and inviting me for training on Thursday. ) The next thing that I remember is being online early in the evening and being tired, thinking that I want to sleep. Trying to sleep and failing. Downloading and watching the most recent episode of The Riches. Then the night goes on, I’m wondering what’s happening to my car, which is not even really my car but Bruce’s car. I’m on the Internet reading about how dangerous a city Philadelphia is and how common are muggings and why am I living in the city when this isn’t what I know, isn’t what I’m comfortable with and I’m doing it alone? Because I was in a hurry and that’s where I could find a sublet. But now I’m thinking that it might have been a mistake. I thought that I was in danger back in Massachusetts because I delivered pizzas and worked at convenience stores, but here I’m about as likely to be jumped just because I’m walking down the street, right? Oh, I don’t know. Please, universe, don’t let anyone bash my skull in with a brick from the sidewalk! I want a cigarette but have finished my pack. I wait for the sun to rise. Where do I go? Where do I park? It’s light out now. I walk to the car. I haven’t really been given enough space to pull out. I hit the car in front of me as I’m bit by bit working myself out from the curb, but that’s what bumpers are for, and it’s early enough that there’s no one awake to be watching me. I text message Alice, ask her to let me know when she’s awake. No response. I’m not surprised, at this hour. Screw it, I can’t keep a car here. I’ll drive back to Massachusetts and sleep there. I call Mom on the way. I’m somewhere around Trenton. Am I really going to make it there on so little sleep? I hope I don’t die. I screw everything up! Right now the best plan that I have, as far as what to do with my life, is to somehow take classes at Johns Hopkins and learn court reporting at the same time. Right? There are two community colleges within commuting distance of Baltimore City that offer court reporting, to some extent. Neither of them is a real, for-credit program, though. Neither of them is designed to meet the standards of the National Court Reporters Association. So I’m also thinking, since a course at Hopkins would be only once a week, I could stay in Philly and just drive down to Baltimore once a week. No, that doesn’t make any sense at all. I want to be a grown-up! Meanwhile my Mom thinks that I should move to Virginia, where my cousins Ken and Amy are now each (separately) living. When I listened to some of American Doll Posse on the Tori Amos MySpace, I wasn’t getting into it. It all seemed so schizophrenic and I just couldn’t follow it, I guess. But now I think I’m liking it, probably because I am feeling crazy as well. Why am I crazy? Why am I crazy? I pass through New York fairly quickly this time. Alice has woken up and I’m explaining to her what I’m doing. I’m texting with Julian, too, as always. He really can’t afford all those pre-paid cell phone minutes, but he keeps buying them anyway. And I say that that’s not love? But I don’t know anything anymore. Who could expect to, having been awake… how long? I can’t even figure it out. I get to my mom’s house. Neither she nor Bruce are home. I need Memé’s help to find the key. I go inside and sleep… wake up at something like 8:30 PM. What do I do? Internet things, I guess. I chat with Bluejay; they say that they and their boyfriend Rob are probably moving to Portland, Oregon at the end of June and that I should go, too. But I’m supposed to be in my sublet until the end of August. Not that I really feel all that bound to anything. It’s not like I’m on a lease or officially signed anything. There’s a court reporting school in Portland… Jonny had called during my ride up to say that he got our two day passes to the Virgin Festival outside Baltimore in early August, where The Smashing Pumpkins will be playing, along with a lot of other fun bands. Can I really walk to the zoo and work there full-time and walk back, still making ends meet, all summer, all the hot and disgusting summer? The simple solutions seem just as improbable as my wacky, bold, difficult ones. And rarely in my life has the simple solution gotten me anywhere. I want to be somewhere. Oh, crap. The information session at Hopkins is tonight slash tomorrow night. And oh, crap. I have no clue when the orientation at the zoo is, except that it happens tomorrow slash today. I couldn’t make it to either without a car. So, on second thought, I could stash my car somewhere, couldn’t I? Monthly parking in a garage is an option, albeit an expensive one. It’s not within budget, but then again, nothing is. I leave at something like 4 AM and drive south again. I’m too late for the zoo orientation. Now I have no job leads. I drive to Baltimore. As I’m arriving in the city, Salma calls. She’s planning to stay with me in Philly one night before visiting her parents in New Jersey and then seeing Wendy’s final Film project at SUNY Purchase. (Wait, is that also when Dan from the Cumberland Farms is supposed to be in Philly? But he never got back to me after I replied to his MySpace message. I was supposed to rent a room in the house where he was living, at one point. That was when I wasn’t keeping a journal, in late 2006. ) Salma asks, would I like for her to invite Julian to catch a ride along with her? Julian could then have me “all to herself” afterwards. I’m not sure, and I’m also presently lost in Baltimore. I park and walk around. Figuring that I have time, I get a burger and fries and flip through a free newspaper. Then I figure out where I’m going, am stuck in rush hour traffic in the downtown, traffic cops direct everyone to take detours, a small group of people are protesting the continued presence of American troops in Iraq (although this doesn’t seem to be the cause of the detour) and by the time I even see the Johns Hopkins University for the first time, I’m late. The open house thing is only like an hour long, so it’s not even worth it if I’m going to be like twenty minutes late. I didn’t R. S. V. P. for it anyway, and it sounds like it’s more for prospective applicants than for admitted students. I have heard only bad things about Baltimore, so I’m surprised that nothing I’ve seen yet has turned me off of it. Even when I get lost I am still in what appear to be good areas. The campus of JHU is beautiful, and seeing the students relaxed on benches, sipping tea, wearing dresses, it somehow finally occurs to me what kind of institution this is, how amazing it might be to actually work on a degree there. This is it, I think to myself, I’m going here, and I’m going to do well, and that’s final. Salma texts me. I’m in Delaware on my way back to Philly. Her mom doesn’t like the idea of Salma doing all that driving, because the inspection sticker on her car is expired. That makes sense, but it might throw a wrench into her plans for next weekend. It’s after 6 PM when I get back to Philadelphia, so I can park in my neighborhood for now. I just have to remember to get up early in the morning to move the car. It’s early in the evening now, and I plan to go to sleep immediately, so I know that unlike most everything else I’ve attempted to do recently, I am not going to screw this up. I move the car in the morning, get coffee and cigarettes and write. Then I drive toward the suburbs. Stop at a diner and write. My mom calls. I explain what’s happening. In Springfield, Pennsylvania I stop at the Starbucks near the Panera Bread, the place where I spent so much time for the sake of having using their wi-fi, back in March. The payroll guy from Cumberland Farms called me back and wants to know where to send my checks. I wonder if there’s anywhere I could park out here in the suburbs. I text message Alice: “Good morning!” “Good morning sunshine!” she replies. “I’m not sunshine. I’m a beautiful rain cloud! Want some company? I’m hangin out in Springfield now. ” I sit staring at my open journal, confused about what to do now that my written narrative has caught up to me. I’m just waiting for her to text a response. La la la. “We’re running some errands. If you’re still around when we’re done I’d love to see you. ” Dang. Not the response that I would have preferred. “Cool,” I respond, “Wanna let me know when it’s a good time?” I’m writing in the car in the Starbucks parking lot. I could go back in there and read. Yeah, I think I’ll do that. I am twenty-six years old. But first I think I’ll write a li’l. How can I move to near Baltimore—it’s certainly too much a drive from Philadelphia to do weekly—and still advance my career prospects (erm, create some job prospects)? This is when I wish that I had Internet on my phone. I just don’t know. Franklin is working on the car. Something about the air intake, I think. Alice is outside as well, wearing sunglasses, with P. in a strap of some sort, asleep behind her back. Greetings. How are things? I don’t even know how to answer that. Alice and I go for a walk to buy some Pabst Blue Ribbon for Franklin. I hang out for maybe a couple of hours before driving back into the city. Then I’m online, applying for some job when Bluejay texts to ask me what I’m doing. I say not much, they say they’re in West Philly visiting at a friend’s place, I should come. I’ve never gone that far west in the city before. I show up, we’re sitting in the living room for a moment before it is mentioned that the friend, being out of beer, wants to walk to a neighborhood bar. I forget now what the place was called. The inside was very small, so the real hangout was outside. We stood around, talked about Bluejay and Rob’s plan to move to Oregon. I ask the friend, whose name is maybe Ty, what his story is. He’s from far out in Pennsylvania, moved here to the city because he wanted more tolerance for his lifestyle (although he doesn’t mention what that lifestyle is). Meanwhile, I’m texting with Salma (but I’m getting distracted, then remembering, then quickly reading through multiple new messages). I also text message Bluejay, who is standing right across from me: “In the twenty-first century, we don’t talk to each other anymore. ” Then we go to the Philly Diner. I get coffee and water and cheese fries (which, of course, because we’re in Philly, are made with Cheez Whiz). We talk and all is well. I give Ty a ride back. He invites me to come in and play video games, but it’s like 3:30 in the morning and I don’t feel like staying up any longer. I go home and sleep, setting my cell phone to wake me up in time to go to the Philadelphia Writers Meetup… sleep too late even for that. I’m waking up in the middle of the afternoon on Saturday. Where are my cigarettes? Oh, I left them in the car. I’ll pick them up on my way to get a morning coffee. May as well do that at the 7-11, pick up some other items as well. Pretty much that’s all I leave the house for today. I send out my resumé to a position conducting market research at multiplexes or whatever. Hear back just about immediately and have a phone interview scheduled for Monday. I’m chatting with that Internet girl Emily, who is about to graduate, who is then coming to Philly. She’s sarcastic, sort of abrasive. Meanwhile, I’m typing up what I’ve been writing in this paper journal. Trying to catch up. I talk to Social Worker Michelle, from back in the Fire &amp; Water days, about whom I always only vaguely remember napping next to once on her bed, and her kissing me quickly and nervously goodbye that one time; who would recite, sitting down, poems about insecurity; who lived alone with dolls and action figures and listened to good music, made a nice mix tape for me, which I listened to sometimes while I was driving in that red Chevy Cavalier I used to drive, the stereo in which I had a tape deck, when one of the speakers seemed to be blown out or something, so it was never the best sound quality. I chat with Emily some more, give her my cell number. She texts me: “omg die” and then half-heartedly pretends online that it wasn’t her. "

    "body": "I lie down on the mattress in the center of my room. It’s not bad, sleeping on just a mattress. I even find something aesthetically pleasing about the way it makes a room look—more open, you know? I watch The Fantastic Adventures of Unico, thanks to YouTube. I haven’t seen it since I was in V. ’s old bedroom at her parents’ house in Bakersfield, when she unearthed the old Betamax VCR and a recording from (I assume) The Disney Channel in the 1980s. I had had it recorded on VHS. Sometimes, as I recall, my family was able to try out cable TV for free, for a week or two. That must have been how I had recorded for myself, in the 1980s, The Fantastic Adventures of Unico. Or perhaps my memory of an analog life is just false. All the cells in my body have been replaced since then. What is it they say? Seven years, then there’s nothing left, physically, of what you used to be? So I created myself, and have only ever existed in the twenty-first century, my life has always been downloadable. “Do you see yourself in Unico?” asked Michelle. I quickly found saved within the “memories” of V. ’s old LiveJournal her post (from 2002) describing a phenomenon she called “The Unico Complex”. A person with a Unico Complex, she said, tries to live forever as Unico does in that movie—always using his magical powers to bring love and friendship wherever he goes, yet never staying around for long, literally being carried away by the West Wind. My jokey response to that LiveJournal post had been, “I would give my opinion here, but I have to run off now to enlighten someone else’s existence. ” I go to sleep… and wake up early, surprised that it’s early. That wasn’t a long sleep at all. It’s my first time using the coffee maker I brought here from Massachusetts. The spoons scoop differently here, different from any of the spoons I had used with this coffeemaker before. What results is coffee that is a little bit weak. I feel bad using the roommates’ milk. Maybe I should buy some little packaged creamers, keep ‘em in the fridge. Some toilet paper for the house, too; I’ve just been using theirs. And maybe some hand soap. Mental note. I shave (changing the blade of my razor because it’s gross, using the electric for my actual face but the regular razor for my neck area) (and it took me so long, until I was into my twenties, to figure out how to use anything other than an electric razor. Even still I cut myself a little a couple of times today. The blood smears, so it looks worse than it is. Heals immediately. ) and shower (bar soap; cheap but nice-smelling, not too chemical-like, shampoo) (and I forgot my towel, so I dry off with the shirt that I just changed out of). I’m looking to see where this sci-fi/fantasy writers’ meetup (organized on meetup. org) is being held. The Double Shot at Chestnut and 2nd. I’m at the computer when there’s a knock at my door. It’s my housemate Owen, asking if I’d mind not being around for a couple of hours, since the landlord is supposed to be showing the place and it’s not clear to what extent Chris, who lived in my room previously and whose name is on the lease, has cleared with him the matter of my subletting. “Well,” I say, “The landlord did come by the other day and showed off the place. I wasn’t expecting it, he was surprised to see me, and I sort of explained that I had just moved in. ” But I say that I was planning to take off from the apartment for a bit, anyway. I take the El, sitting in front of loud tourists. I walk to South Street to get a pizza at that place where they only sell slices of cheese and it’s supposed to be super-tasty but to me it just tastes average, nothing to get excited about. I have been walking around with my cash wrapped around my cards and identification, kept in my front pocket. I’ve stopped at an automatic teller machine and withdrawn thirty dollars. I haven’t spent anything—used a token for the subway—so I have a twenty and a ten. I pull out the ten, planning to pay for my slice with it. Then I notice that the ten dollar bill is gone. It’s not in my hand. I look around. I don’t see it anywhere, so I have to pay with my twenty. Did someone just snatch it from me without my noticing? I think so. Casually walking by where the coffee place is supposed to be, I don’t see it. So I wander, then see that there is some sort of Pride festival going on. A handful of bible-quoting “Stop the sexual immorality” types are there, too, sadly. I’ve been thinking about how cool it would be to have a stenograph machine and to know how to use it. That would come in handy when I write in paper journals, then want to type everything up. Wouldn’t it? But there’s just some non-credit courses offered out in Maryland at a couple of community colleges. Something tells me that employers would want a degree, not just skills. There’s one legit program offered online, but you have to find somebody who’s already a court reporter and have them agree to proctor your exams? What’s up with that? Like, seriously? The full program that’s closest to Baltimore is right here in Center City, Philadelphia. I wonder what the scheduling there is like. So here’s what I’m going to do: I’m going to look for some more job postings for captioners, reporters, whatever, and see what, specifically, they ask for. Then tomorrow (Monday) I’ll try calling Orleans Tech, the school here in Philly, and see what they have to say about course scheduling, I guess. But what does that even matter? It doesn’t, I guess. Maybe I can find something else to do, while living in Baltimore, that will help me move towards that goal of my being able to earn enough money to survive on my own. But what is out there that I haven’t already considered? Bus driving, I suppose. Only thing that’s kept me from trying that is, I’ve never planned to be in any one city for long enough. They tend to like commitment if they’re gonna train you. But anyway, no, no! I should be thinking about a real career here! Well, how about writing? That would be interesting, right? Eh. (I think to invite Bluejay to join me at these festivities, but when I text they say that they’re sitting around thinking and aren’t feeling very social. As they look into it, the idea of moving to Portland immediately is starting to seem less feasible. ) I could, after all, survive, couldn’t I? Maybe, who knows, actual survival not guaranteed, but make enough money to support myself as a bus driver, or hell, just doing the sort of thing that I was doing in Mass. , delivering pizzas in some suburbs, then some other random job. Are those college students, who are next to where I’m sitting, throwing spitballs? Holy shit. I never thought that was funny, even in grade school. Whatever. I’m going back to the apartment. So I look up things online. Not all, but enough of the positions that I see hiring machine stenographers ask for a degree in reporting (even sometimes asking specifically for an NCRA-approved program) that I sort of say to myself, “If I’m going go to JHU, I may just have to stick with that, no backup career. ” I look at blogs of people with M. F. A. s. They complain about office work, always working on some project, write about the market for their preferred genre, say that if you’re going to be a writer no matter what then of course it’s worth it, or they make fun of themselves and anyone else for pursuing the degree, they ghost write, they copyedit. Non-profit, there’s something I could maybe get into. I find some resources for volunteering. I would still like to move to Canada, of course, but they seem to prefer taking in people with job skills. Sitting around online all day, I’m thinking, may not be getting me much of anywhere. Maybe I should, in fact, volunteer, have fun with that, see if it leads to anything. I just want to work, but the jobs I can get now aren’t enough for me to afford my life, and they don’t lead me anywhere. So it goes: if you live your life as though you need money, you’re probably not going to get it. Who wants to be working with someone like that, always needing money? We want our co-workers to be cool and confident, talking about their dates and vacations and popular movies. No wonder I’ve been a convenience store clerk, worrying all the time, trying to find ways to earn more, trying to support myself because I fear that I’m going to lose all of my teeth, all of my friends and all of my free time if I don’t. These are all markings of someone who is to be counted among the working poor. Maybe what it’s really all about is what you display to the world. Maybe it’s what the others think you are, not who. But this is just the story that I tell to the void. This is my ever-changing, ever-temporary belief system—one life, one little structure built for myself here, today, in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania… Okay, story. Now jump ahead. Not too far: just a day. It’s Monday now. I woke up at eleven-something but my car wasn’t ticketed, thankfully. I moved the car, got some coffee. Sat and wrote, didn’t do super-well on the phone interview for part-time survey conducting at a movie theater but they want to do an in-person on Saturday. I parked my car in an urban bed of flower petals. I’m going to move the car again now, go back to the apartment, do some laundry. Where do I do laundry? I’m sorry, Mom, for taking all of your money. Sometimes I feel like a failure and other times, I just sing my song, my own little melody, which is often in my head: Life’s okay: I’m not on heroin! Life’s okay: I don’t smoke crack!&lt;/i&gt; Time passes. Again, it’s not much time. I have new people to chat with online—not only Emily, but I’m still also talking to Claudia (one of the first people to reply to my OKCupid profile down here) and Sarina from just outside Baltimore, who is a twenty-year-old student working internships and planning a career in non-profit social work while also enjoying (as a livelihood) metalsmithing. The checks and such that my mom had sent to me were, as it turns out, returned to her by the postal service, so at least we know that no one is stealing my mail or identity. Yeah, it has to be Baltimore. This is what I’m thinking, now. I have to go there, I have to do my best, I have to write some amazing fiction and meet people and know that I sort of belong where I am. (There is no certain life path. There is no probable life path, even. We can’t be reasonable about these things. ) And after a long night in my room and in front of the computer, I walk (with the sun newly risen) when the people are not quite awake. Everything is quiet. Walking by my car on 34th Street, where I parked it a day and a half ago. It’s fine. I have my MP3 player with me. I’m listening to Dido, the singer. The album is Life for Rent. I go to the 7-11 and get some stuff, including toilet paper for the house. Anxiety hasn’t helped me. I am not with Alix anymore. Those books have been written. For all the huge gaps that were left in them, I still know that all I have left is my retrospect, my archives, my TiVo’d brain. Charlie? Working in food service. Tina has been hardly at all social, in a domestic bliss with the same guy, whom I don’t even recall ever having met. She’s living somewhere I never saw, although I always loved to see where Tina was living at any given time, didn’t mind when I was just brought in to help her move or decorate. Marie is getting married. Regarding the details, she has different stories to tell different family and friends. “Your marriage plans are an intricate web of deceit,” I said. “Well, you know me!” she said. Mandy, I don’t know. Alix is out of range. Maurice, I’ll probably see him again, here and there, but it will be even more different than it has become already. Annie vanished. Audrey records music sometimes, I think. Carrie’s in California. Hank disappeared. Agatha, after graduating, moved to D. C. , and we’re not in touch. Brianna was in Chicago, then Toronto. Out of range. People sometimes stop being intrigued with each other. Liv, I have no idea. Mick I haven’t seen since one of the house parties on Cherry Street, when he was visiting from New York, when he seemed like someone who didn’t know me. Scientist Jen is doing science things, now in New Jersey. Katie is finishing her Master’s, going on for her Ph. D. Unsurprisingly, she’s not online much, doesn’t take much time to talk. Moon? Colin? I don’t know. Greg? I don’t know. Sarah N. ? I don’t know. Mischa moved to Fresno. Silvia is moving to Austin? I would like to hear from Alicia, who, last I knew, had moved down south. I seem to have strayed from my point a bit, but the point was this: start something new. Get in your remembrances now because you’re twenty-six years old, you have friends all over the place, there is nothing except for you that can screw up this latest fleeting opportunity to love some new people. That’s what you want, isn’t it? It’s certainly not fame or admiration that you’re looking for. You don’t even need to prove to yourself that you can “do it”, anymore. The real challenge is to continue knowing yourself, and to reconcile the present self with a present world. Nothingness relents, Reader, and opens to everything… I have a day, a full day, full of fun, exploring further into University City with Alyson, who is twenty-two years old, who is in town since last night (Tuesday, May 8, 2007) until Sunday. We eat food. In my car, Alyson applied band-aids to her aching feet. She is, characteristically, wearing black boots that have huge, flat heels. We get to Shampoo easily enough. Finally, I’m going to Nocturne. We drink, chat, dance, smoke. Alyson asks a random question of someone at the bar and conversation is maintained from there. Someone else tries to talk to her, also. One of these guys keeps talking with her throughout the night. Clearly I’m supposed to step away and do my own thing at such points, and I do. I talk to one stranger, next to the jacuzzi (which is in the outside area, which is covered like a tent and has a dance floor and functions as a smoking area). The music in this room is ’80s. The gal I talk to is nice enough and I’m pleasant enough, although she excuses herself before long. Bluejay, who didn’t reply to my text message earlier, actually does end up coming to the club. After the place empties out, we (Bluejay, Alyson, and the guy who was talking to Alyson and me) are the last ones standing outside. We go to the Philly Diner, then, and it’s great, old-fashioned fun. I drop Alyson off at her motel somewhere in New Jersey. 	I lie down to sleep… wake up around 11 in the morning to a call from the second temp agency I interviewed at, the one that tested my typing skills but (depressingly) didn’t assign me to the data entry job for which I had applied. Now they’re talking about a tele-research job, calling doctors and pharmacists to ask questions about the drugs they prescribe. Full-time temporary. I go in to talk to them about it on Monday. Then I sleep again… wake up, get the car (having parked even a little further up 34th Street this time) and drive to McDonald’s, get a Quarter Pounder with Cheese Extra Value Meal, substituting a coffee for the fountain drink. I drive back to the apartment and think about what to do with myself this weekend. I call my mom and make plans to come up. I may as well drive tonight, since I’m going to be awake. I’ll just cancel my interview with the movie research people. I would be really excited to have the other job, the one I just got called about this morning. I keep getting distracted tonight, editing my old journals into a cohesive Life Story. Eventually, at 10 PM, I close my laptop, smoke a cigarette, shower and begin driving north. It’ll be a Mother’s Day visit for me, plus I’ll get to go to Britta’s farewell party, plus I can get some replacement corrective eyewear for myself… "

    "body": "Reading Proust will have taken me about a year—with gaps, of course, particularly between finishing Swann’s Way and (as my edition is named) In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower. I was with Alix and she was staying in that attic in Holyoke when I began the first book. I was taking that graduate course in American Poetry and delivering pizzas in Chicopee while reading the second book. The Guermantes Way was mostly read on the job at the Granby Cumberland Farms. Sodom and Gomorrah was how I occupied myself when I first arrived in Pennsylvania, hadn’t learned to use the neighbor’s wireless bandwidth, and had a lot of time to kill. The Captive and The Fugitive were read while I was working at Petsmart: I carried the book around with me and read it during my lunch break, or while waiting for the bus, or when I was taking the train into the city. Now it’s just down to Time Regained. And here I am in Massachusetts, at my mom’s house. I sleep… wake up, Salma has a fever. Kelsey is going to the party tonight, and I already knew that Julian is going. I cancel my interview for the moviegoer market research thing, so if I’m able to stay here an extra day or two. After stepping outside for a cigarette this morning while talking to my mom (which is somehow easier now that I no longer live nearby) I walked back inside and asked, “Has it always been this pretty out there?” She said that yes, it has always been that pretty outside. It’s spring now: there are leaves on the trees, lots of trees and lots of leaves, so it’s like a big green canopy over the area of the outside steps. Already, it seems—so quickly!—that I’ve grown used to tall buildings on the horizon, murals painted on the sides of buildings, trolley tracks in the middle of the streets, steam from the subway tunnels rising up through vents as I walk to get a morning coffee. I forgot what life in the woods was like. Meanwhile, of course, not only active service members but reservists, for some time now, have been returning to America from stations in the Middle East, only to be called up again and again. It’s hard to say how it affects Americans to be playing this role, feeling important but also so powerless, so fortunate to be where we are but so deeply unhappy, the whole lot of us. I do, after all, wonder if this hopelessness—this deep fear that glazes over our souls until the disconnect between our caricature (our identity) and our true, fleeting but recurring feelings about our experience of life is really all that we have left (unless we are to be seen as rebels and radicals destined to be lost, certain to burn out young and to be forgotten, torched at a stake by some abstract something known as society, all for our simple magic) of what once seemed a natural, just, unquestionable process, growing up and finding our place. Editing my old journals into a Life Story, it is the parts like this I cut first: me trying to build theories about the greater situation of our world, or even just our country, or our generation. These theories, without the weight of armies and laws and subsidization, without tenure and grants for the theories’ proponents, quickly get revealed for the straw houses they are. Lacking any forceful coercion, all that’s left for nobodies like me is rhetoric. We’re confused people throwing our passions into artfulness. We’re rock bands throwing around our instruments as we play our songs before a young (less frightened) audience, an audience that still, for the moment, believes. I go to the Holyoke Mall. Already it seems like I don’t recognize half of the stores. Both of the Nancy’s Cafés are gone; the one that I worked at was converted into a Subway sandwich shop some years back, but there were still two more in the mall until recently. One of the old locations is a Blue Moon Coffee Roasters now, while the other is going to be a Starbucks. I’ve never seen a Starbucks in a shopping mall, that I can recall, except as a kiosk thing. I get coffee from the Blue Moon Coffee Roasters, set up an eye exam for tomorrow at 7 PM, then drive to Northampton. A hug for Britta, a long hug for Julian. I hesitate momentarily before hugging Daisy, but then say, “Yeah, you get a hug, too!” and she says something like, “Yes, it’s okay. We can hug. ” I haven’t quite figured out how to act around her. Probably, this is because Britta always tells me that Daisy has looking forward to seeing me and that I should make out with her (and because, too, after all these years, I still sort of don’t know what to make of Britta, either). Oh, that’s Kurt! He has short hair now. It makes him look somewhat less dashing, but he also seems more relaxed. Then I talk to another guy I remember, I actually think he’s a MySpace friend of mine, too, he’s always at these parties. As the night goes on, this guy talks about how his girlfriend would not be amused by the scantily-clad ladies and the vintage, silent, black and white porn that is playing on repeat in Britta’s living room. Drinking, drinking. I probably got there at quarter ‘til nine and so there’s lots of time, time for us to be drinking. Julian is certainly drinking. At first it’s really nice to have him around. Isn’t it always! Yeah, but he got more and more drunk and was eventually, it seems, not doing anything except pushing himself against me. Not just a hug. Here we are at the party. His face up against mine. What do I do? He’s engaged! He’s engaged! Before that, while I had been apart from Julian, outside smoking, Daisy said to me, “Here, double-fist this,” handing me her cigarette while she went in to the bathroom. I took a couple of drags from it, then lost the cherry. I went inside after a few minutes to see if she was out of the bathroom, to give her the clip, but she was still in there. Eventually I opened the door just enough to put my arm in, handing her what was left of the cigarette (which wasn’t much). (More reminders of how my hugging is what it seems that people really like about me. Whom was I hugging when I said… I think it might actually have been Gwen, not the Gwen who was always doing bowling with Julian but a different Gwen, who had a few visible tattoos including a pentagram on her back/shoulder, I recognized her but didn’t remember her name so had to catch it when somebody addressed her… maybe it was her I was hugging when I said, “This is my one talent. This is what I’m known for,” something like that. Yes, I kept being reminded of this idea throughout the night. I was talking with Julian in the kitchen when Kurt from behind took me and gave me a big hug, it actually hurt, I said, “Ow! I’m not used to people being that strong, hugs hurting,” something like that. ) But anyway, yes, I reached my hand, holding the still-smokable remnants of Daisy’s cigarette, into Britta’s bathroom, knowing that Daisy was still in there. She takes the cigarette and my hand, steps out. The light in the bathroom is already off. She’s hugging me, then, and kissing me some. Holding on, I probably ask her something brilliant like, “How are you?” She’s starting to feel more drunk than she had intended to get. While we’re there, Britta has a nonverbal exchange with Daisy and then Britta is protectively saying, “No, Daisy, because I love you. ” As this is happening, I’m separating myself from Daisy. I take from Britta’s words that she’s advising Daisy not to be like this with me. The idea sticks in my head for the next half hour or so of the party, the words popping into my head while I’m having some or other conversation: “Because I love you. ” I’ve learned, though: don’t get moody at parties. Just try to distract yourself. Strike up conversation with anyone who is not too preoccupied. Don’t let anybody see you sulk: that would be like farting in a church. Whatever little thing was bothering you, you can forget about it. It will move to the back of your mind. Lydia has arrived with her current partner, who is a bit like having a second Lydia around, pleasant to converse with, possessing of a devious smile, charming, caressing various ladies. At one point, I notice that Daisy has collapsed across Julian on the floor; Julian points to me and commands, “Floor!” and Daisy says that there’s plenty of room on her lap for everyone. Tina is also at the party. She seems happier than most of the various forms of Tina I have known over the years. I remember still so vividly, above all else, from the brief time when Tina and I were together, when she first came to the Valley from eastern Mass. , her lying down, calling to me, “Levi! You’re too far away” when it was just the two of us in my Intimacy room; lounging about, cuddling together watching movies and that sort of thing is the essence that in my mind unifies the various Tinas and makes her someone about whom, when all is said and done (whatever that may mean, however far down along the line that may be) I will still think smilingly. She wants to laze and to love, to be pleasant and comfortable, to be at peace with others and to have a good life. That ain’t no crime. I go outside, talk probably with Kurt’s longtime roommate (I’m told that he’s the gay man who seems straight, while Kurt is the straight man who seems gay). He is almost always standing alone at this party; this is probably part of why I keep striking up conversation with him. At some point, Daisy is dancing in the living room with the other gal who came dressed according to the Baden Baden theme. It’s fishnet tight and exposed thigh city. Others are watching, of course. I feel like dancing, too. “Kelsey! Come dance with me!” I say. There has already been a photograph taken tonight of Kelsey humping my leg. She dances against me like a half-human, half-fish starving for oxygen. It’s awesome. Hugging Britta in the kitchen, I asked, “So do you think I’ll ever see you again?” “Well,” she said, “I’ll be here for a few more weeks before I leave for London. ” “No, I mean after that,” I say. I’m not sure that she wants to answer this question. I add, “Because I like you. ” “I know,” she says. “I may not be clear about these things, I’m a confusing person. “Yes,” she says, “You are. ” And so on until she tells me again that I should make out with Daisy. I say, “I thought you were, like, breaking us up earlier, when she and I were hugging by the bathroom. ” “No, no! She wants it. Definitely make out with her. ” Time goes by. The party goes on. “Hi there, Mr. Levi,” says someone to me in the kitchen. Who is it but Maurice, seeming social, in the mood, apparently, to catch up on how I’ve been. He and I talk for a bit while the police come a couple of times. (This is unsurprising, since parties are going on both here upstairs and also downstairs, on a night hot enough that with a bunch of people inside, it’s a little uncomfortable, so people have been wanting to take their conversations outside. ) Volume gets kept down, we’re not breaking any laws if we’re being quiet, so, yeah, Maurice and I are talking. “I hate this town now,” he says of Northampton, “I’m sick of irony. ” He’s naming that dance night at The Basement (the bar, not to be confused with his band) as an example of what’s wrong with the scene: people thinking it’s cool to dance to music that’s only cool because it’s not cool—early ’90s rap and the like. He adds, “It’s a lot like the way that I came to grow tired of Brooklyn. ” He’s liking hanging out in Greenfield now: he says, “It’s a lot like Northampton was when you and I were teenagers. ” I say that yeah, I can see how Northampton has become more like a tourist trap. I compare it to Provincetown. “Yes!” he agrees. About Greenfield he says, “As far as I can tell, we are the only place in the country where the local music scene is, like, crust punk bluegrass—dirty kids in tattered clothes playing the banjo. ” He’ll be doing a little bit of touring with his poetry again soon, he says: “I’m just now getting out there and doing it again. ” “The slam poetry, you mean?” “Not necessarily slam. Just art. Getting involved with art in general again. ” He says that he took a cab here all the way from Montague because he figured that it would be his last chance to say goodbye to Britta. He has heard about Marie’s wedding: “So do you think she makes it to the altar?” he asks. “Yeah,” I say, “I think she does. I haven’t really thought too much about it, though. ” “No, I actually think she goes through with it, too. Which is good: we were getting dangerously close to thirty. ” “Oh yeah!” I say, remembering Marie and Maurice’s long-standing agreement to marry each other if both were still single at the age of thirty. So yeah, it was really after this that Julian started hanging on me as I mentioned before. He just stares at me. Stares. Stares. It’s so awkward, and I just want to escape. I don’t know what to do. I asked him earlier in the night, “Do you want to come watch me pee?” and so he held the doorknob to make sure that no one else came in while I peed. Then I did the same for him while he peed. Against the wall, pulling me against him, he said, “I would be doing this even if I hadn’t been drinking. ” I let myself kiss him; I haven’t really been doing that for most of the night, I’ve been looking away when he rubs his nose against mine, that sort of thing. “But we should probably do this on the porch instead of in the bathroom, in case someone else has to pee,” I say. Then I get distracted, talking with someone else. Britta: “You should go find Daisy. ” Me: “Oh, she’s still here?” “She’s in the bedroom. She’ll pretend to be asleep, but talk to her. ” Daisy has her eyes open, though. Made-up eyes that face me as I enter, as I close the door back behind me. Not moving her body, she closes her eyes when she smiles. “Daisy’s pretty,” Julian had volunteered to me earlier in the night, sounding like he had personally been charmed. I had met Daisy when she was on her way to becoming Harvey’s girlfriend. Maybe I don’t understand. Maybe I do. Maybe I’ve known too many gals, ladies, chicks, and women as beloved friends. Maybe I don’t take anything too seriously except friendship, unless it’s a part of my story. Maybe I’m happier when I write. I sit down on the floor next to the bed. “You’re lovely,” she says. “Why would you say that I’m lovely!” I respond. Something, something. I ask, “Should I MySpace message you sometime, or something?” “You’d better,” she says. Julian was right, of course: Daisy is very pretty. We talk for many seconds before Julian enters. Once he has opened the door, others crowd in, and I walk out. By this point I have for a while been drinking water, no more alcohol. Julian is leaving, getting a ride with Kurt. Eventually I return to Britta’s bedroom and find that it has cleared out somewhat, Daisy is playing with my hair while I’m on the floor (facing away from her). Kelsey comes in, then she and Daisy are high-fiving each other about improbable things to high-five about (“Body image issues!”—Slap! “Mom issues!”—Slap! “Fearing that you’ll always be alone!”—Slap!) I’m just having my hair played with, laughing at their humor sometimes. The other scantily-clad gal is on the bed with them, I turn around at one point and discover that her butt-cheek is about an inch from my face. “Uh,” I say, “What’s your name, again?” Maurice wanders in, says that Erik from Bart’s is supposed to come; then, a bit later, says that Erik pulled up, saw the cop parked outside and decided not to come, after all. Enough time has passed since I stopped drinking that I have no worries about driving. I say goodbye to the handful of people who are left. I drive home. I MySpace message Daisy. The subject line is “Rise and shine!” The body reads, “Hopefully you’re recovering well. With Britta fleeing the States, we finally have an opportunity to never see each other again. Also, you can reach me at” and then my cell phone number. She responds the next evening with, “No hangover, surprisingly. [Her cell phone number] (appreciative of calls at all hours, with emergency and without) I enjoyed playing with your hair, and that you restored my partial-cigarette to me even though I never did smoke it. Also, you’re lovely. ” To which I later respond (under the subject line, “Why would you say that I’m lovely!”): “Also, you can call me whenever. I forgot to say that. Thank you for playing with my hair; for not minding that my arm violated your privacy while you were in the pee-room; for seeming to enjoy my company. I hope we stay in touch. Sincerely, Also” It is on Saturday that I sleep an excessive amount; get an eye exam and temporary contact lenses; and see Lyric. Lyric and I pretty much just go to Fire Cuisine in Northampton, where I get mozzarella sticks (and as substitution, since they’re short two mozzarella sticks, I get two chicken tenders) and then back to her place, where I drop her off. The whole experience of hanging out with her this time is a blur in my mind. I’m sure whether or not this was the fault of either one of us. I pretty much just spend the overnight writing this. In the morning, I wish my mom a happy Mother’s Day before she’s off to the casino with Memé, Kim and Brenda. Salma, earlier in the night, was considering going to the emergency room because of her fever, but later on she told me that the fever had gone back down. I text message Julian, requesting that if I die, he should find my Life Story on my computer and turn it over to someone who is familiar with me and who has some experience editing, so that my Life Story can be made into a keepsake.

    "body": "I wake up in the afternoon. Walk Amherst with Julian, then drive with him to Greenfield, Leyden, Shelburne Falls and back to Sunderland. We stand in the dark at the bottom of a small mountain. I drop him off, head back to Chicopee to get my stuff, and drive back towards Philadelphia. It occurs to me during this drive that I can plug my laptop into the car stereo and listen to any of the MP3s on my hard drive that way. It’s just a bit difficult to switch tracks and drive at the same time. Two days and several hours later, it’s about five-thirty in the morning on Wednesday, May 16, 2007. I’m driving east on Market around 34th Street. During Alyson’s last visit, while we were walking eastward in West Philly, she pointed to the three tall buildings that I’m looking at in the distance now and she asked, “What are those?” I hadn’t really been looking up much since moving to the city, too lost and too scared to think much about sightseeing. “Those buildings are called, uh… Freddy, Teddy and Neddy,” I replied. She half-laughed, “Okay. Which is which?” “Uh… left to right. It’s Freddy, then, Teddy, then Neddy. ” This Monday morning I drove out to Paoli and arrived early at the agency office. I sat around for awhile, reading happily. I talked to the guy I had talked to before. He told me about the job. I talked to someone else, who told me about the job again. Then I had to call a hotline and read a script. Just as I was getting back to Philadelphia I was called to say that I could start the next day. The next day, then, was my first experience commuting to work through some honest-to-goodness rush hour traffic. It sucked. I had allowed myself a little over an hour to get from West Philly to Blue Bell (up in Montgomery County) and as it turned out, this was just barely enough. The job is telemarketing for a pharmaceutical company (through a marketing company, through an employment agency) although, of course, I am not officially a telemarketer. No, I am just trying to tell doctors some brand-impression-filled information about how to recommend that their patients save themselves money. (“Levi working for the man!” texted Salma. ) Ten dollars an hour, 9 to 5, Monday through Friday. (Also, Salma is finally feeling better, although she never went to the doctor. Her brother Haris thinks that it was probably pneumonia. ) I am to be working in a building with a glass-walled elevator, a building that is crawling with professionals, a building that is part of a larger complex of buildings, all of them similar, a place for business to be conducted. A thirty-something guy sitting to the left of me is commenting loudly (in this, the designated Training Room, where there are like twenty-five of us) about how boring this is, how low the pay is, how he should just go back to doing landscaping. We’re listening to recordings of other employees making phone calls; he says to the woman at the front of the room, “I’m surprised that we’re not hearing anyone swearing to themselves when they get put on hold. Don’t you hear them letting loose some f-bombs when no one’s on the line?” “Well,” says the woman, “No, we don’t really hear that. We would expect not to hear that. This is a professional setting. ” I make my idle chatter mostly with the 20-year-old guy who is sitting to the right of me. Day two of training is more boring than the first. We’ve been told that we can dress more casually this time, but I sort of don’t, just in case it’s a trick. There is a lot of downtime between learning the computer and practicing the script over and over. I’m beginning to learn everyone’s personality. There’s the loud man, maybe in his late thirties, who talks to everyone about how he is an actor and how he recently filmed a skit for a reality television show. When he speaks to me it’s about movies—not the easiest topic to discuss with me, because I don’t see many movies. Then there’s the guy who repeatedly quotes lines from Adult Swim, apropos of nothing, and either expects me to get the reference or perhaps thinks that if I haven’t memorized every episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force then there is clearly something terribly wrong with me. There’s the nice, quiet but not shy college student girl with whom, in the break room, I lost a niceness contest over which one of us would get the last water cup: “I don’t need it. I already have some juice,” she said for the win. There’s the shy girl in a headband whose bangs hang in her face such that I can never see her eyes. There’s the guy who’s maybe in his late thirties, who looks like he feels out of place in such a young crowd but will talk to you if you talk to him. There are the two guys in blue jeans who, when something in the ceiling breaks, talk to each other about how simple it would be to fix. And so on and so on. Many of us, by the end of the work day, have been called up to go through the “certification” process—a simulated call with a supervisor. By chance I have not, which means that I will have to do it in the morning the next day. Not long after getting home, I fall asleep for a few hours. By then Bluejay has texted me to say that they’re engaged to be married and that by the way, I should come out to Nocturne tonight. I clean myself up, get a coffee at Wawa and drink it on the way to Shampoo. Inside the club, the first thing that I do is buy a drink. I find Bluejay, who has come with their friend, Diamond. I am introduced. We sit on the couches downstairs. I switch from drinking whiskey and coke to drinking Yuengling Lagers. Bluejay tells me that I look exactly the same as I did a few years back, the last time they saw me before I moved down here. There is some dancing. I didn’t arrive particularly early, so the night seems short to me. At one point while Bluejay is on the dance floor I sit down next to Diamond and ask, “Do you mind if I loiter?” We talk for a bit, mostly about the city and the Philly goth scene. Then we exit the club. The two of them start walking toward their car, not paying attention to me, so I sort of shrug and walk in the opposite direction, towards my car. Then I hear, “Levi!” from the parking lot, while I’m walking along the sidewalk on the other side of a chain-link fence. I clutch the fence and make some sort of dumb joke suggestive of being in prison. “I forgot that you like to park on the street instead of in the lot,” says Bluejay, “Do you want to go to the Philly Diner again?” I say that sure, that sounds great. At the diner, there is more talking. I just get fries and a coffee. The two of them both have ordered more than I have. I get the impression that Bluejay is spacey and sleep-deprived. We leave. I go home happy. I’m just going to stay awake, shower away the scent of nightclub, and go to work. Unexpectedly, when I actually start making the phone calls at work, I am a nervous wreck. It really shakes me up. Very gradually over the course of the day I begin to get more comfortable with it. I drive home, check my email, then sleep until it’s time for me to go to work again. I’m less anxious on Friday. It’s still annoying to make the calls, and I feel gross marketing pharmaceuticals, of all things, but at least I’ve calmed down. I text message Daisy for the first time, as I’m driving home. She responds back a couple of times. Alice texts me and asks for me to tell her something happy. I tell her that I cherish her like family. I ask whether she would like some company. She replies yes—just in time, because I receive her message as I’m approaching the exit for Route 1 South from I-76 South. I arrive at their place just as Franklin has started his car, about to leave for a meet and greet for a show in which he and Alice are participating, in which they will be creating art from motorcycle parts. I say hello and proceed inside. I give enthusiastic greetings to Alice, P. and the purring Marquis de Sade. Alice folds laundry. She’s done a lot of cleaning today, she tells me. We talk and talk. Then I’m back at my apartment. I’m tired again. I’m hoping that it’s just the newness of my job that’s making me so mentally tired by the end of each work day. I hang around on the Internet. Julian wants to be with me or something, but I’m not receptive enough to his IMs for him to get into it. I’m busy listening to the new Smashing Pumpkins song, “Tarantula”. In the morning I sit in a sandwich shop with a coffee, revising my Life Story. Then, back at home, I’m online. rae from Jersey is bored, so we arrange to meet for water ice. It’s my first time having water ice. I try it cherry-flavored. I like it. rae (who at some point in the near future will, on LiveJournal, request that her name not be capitalized when written) doesn’t really talk much. She says that she doesn’t have friends, that she only sits around all day on the Internet, but also that nothing’s missing from her life and that she’s doing fine. We eat at a bar and grill. She drops me off at my place. I’m tired again. Time passed. Thinly-veiled telemarketing on behalf of pharmaceutical companies was not, of course, in particular the employment of my dreams; except, you know what? Working 9 to 5 in a cubicle for ten dollars an hour sort of had been a dream of mine. I was wincing before dialing, yes. I was thinking, Please, nobody pick up. Let me listen to the soothing sounds of a voice mail, leave a message then move on; I was always highly conscious of when my next break was going to be, but I did not want to run screaming. In a way, it felt like safety, this office building. If I could keep this up, I thought to myself, maybe next time I could do data entry. That would be awesome. Julian had IM’d me to initiate a talk about how he wants to be with me. There was little for me to say, except that I hadn’t had romantic feelings towards him since quite a long time ago. (If only there were more hours in the day to write—oh, but that’s just how it feels when you’re happy. There’s always something else that you just can’t wait to be doing. Every day holds promises. I don’t know why I’m writing about this in the past tense, pretending to be reminiscing about what’s actually happening right now. To be honest, I’m writing this in the car during my lunch break. Maybe I should eat, too. It’s too bad that the sandwich place is too busy at lunch for me to be able to get any real food. ) The work day zooms by and along with everybody else then I’m speeding down the steps and rather than getting back on the highway to the city I’m stopping at the Plymouth Meeting Mall, where they play my favorite hits from the fifties, sixties, and seventies at a fairly high volume while I walk past Popeye’s Chicken and Borders Books and Suncoast Movies and the Macy’s department spore and the three Foot Locker footwear stores. I buy a chicken cheese steak with bacon on it, plus I have them add lettuce and I have fries and a Wild Cherry Pepsi and I consume it all. Awesome. Meanwhile, I’m reading Time Regained and he’s bringin’ it back to the madeleine and I’m outside on a bench painted brown and the sun being the warm-hot here sun in PA, can’t wait to get home and edit more, it’s going to be great but I can wait, too, oh my God guys it’s just so awesome ‘cuz you know what? Here’s what Salma said to me: “You’re born alone and you die alone. ” Is it even in my Life Story, yet, that one time when I was staying at Maxine’s in California and her father drove us through these weird mountain towns and then we were at the beach in Santa Cruz? I don’t even remember Maxine in this scene even though she was there so it’s just me in black around these surfer dudes, that’s the memory and bikini girls and I’m along this boardwalk, right? Sun shining shining warm-hot, Salma is afraid of being alone, Lyric wants me to contact her more. I said that I would love to so maybe I could call her now and walk through the wide open mall and talk to my friend and celebrate that it’s 2007 and we’re not dead yet and I’m going places and I can work, can be employed and Jonny wants me to re-record the parts to “Extinguish to Vapor”, which was never a good song, but I like my new song “Don’t Take It Personally” and personally, I am so accustomed to being alone that maybe it’s just what’s meant for me. I’ve been thinking about this. I like the sunshine. It’s too bad because I like children and I would like to push one on the swings. Maybe I should buy new shoes while I’m at the mall. I already bought hair conditioner. I do it. I buy those shoes. The woman who helps me is friendly and whatever. Then I go home, set up recording equipment, try to record a take of “Don’t Take It Personally” but fail for various reasons. I chat with Claudia about hanging out at playgrounds. She’s a mom. As I’m lying down to sleep the phone startles me, it’s Salma. She just thought that she’d call, she keeps meaning to respond to my text messages but never gets around to it. She’s talking about the “girls’ night” recently, her and her friends hanging around and playing on hand drums and smoking weed. Hey, cool, sounds like fun! But oh, you know, she’s saying, there’s something when it’s just girls. She keeps talking. I remember that men cannot feel. Of course it’s different when it’s all girls! It’s different when it’s all boys. It’s different when everyone in the room is a machine technician. More and more, I see this happening: we can’t handle the hurt, we settle our mind, it’s always been the “opposite sex” that we’ve been trying to love, we blame them. Them? They’re all the same. They’re lacking something. They’re too much like this. Stupid boys. Stupid girls. Then we marry someone from the gender we hate? We give up trying to respect the opposite sex because it’s easier for us to continue the wars into which we were born? Easier, but false. Lies, lies, lies, everyday lies. Keep in mind that hearing how much nicer it is to be just around girls, it doesn’t make me angry or anything while I’m hearing it. Salma in particular I’ve never been angry at. It’s just that this is the sort of thing that feels to me as though someone is stabbing me repeatedly in the stomach. I feel the wind taken from of my sails. I feel like I’ve been stupid for all these years. That I will always be seen as this category of person I don’t understand. My cell phone alarm doesn’t wake me up in time for work. I move my car. I sit on my mattress with the laptop and type this. Last night Salma was sitting in her closet with the phone while she was talking to me. Every now and again Johnny would open the door and say something to her, then when he was gone our conversation would resume. I make coffee and smoke a few cigarettes before I get in my car and drive on Route 1 South, pass Saint Joseph’s University, then decide that okay, I’ll get some McDonald’s, that’s what I’ll eat. Fries and a burger sitting on the front passenger’s seat, a cup of soda in the cup-holder between the seats. Back to Springfield Township, then: what’s familiar is comfortable. I’m taking the marks that I’ve written in the bound copy of the early part of my Life Story I got printed up and I’m making those changes using my laptop in Panera Bread. The guy from the temp agency calls and asks me what’s up, you didn’t make it into work today and I’m like yeah and he’s like, well, if that happens again, you should call me plus call the company and I’m like, okay and I take down his number and I mention that the number for me to call at the company, I had left that information in my folder in my cubicle. I’ve had this conversation inside of Panera Bread, hate talking on the phone in public. I get my things together and am walking back to the car when the phone rings again, it’s a different person from the temp agency who wants some further clarification on why I didn’t make it in today. “Well, uh,” using a professional voice, “Essentially, I… didn’t wake up. ” He laughs. “What time did you wake up?” he asks. “Around ten o’clock,” I say. “Rough night?” “No, it’s not that. The alarm situation just wasn’t happening…” Then I drive to Media and sit in Starbucks until it’s dark out. Driving home, I talk with Lyric for a bit. Wednesday morning, work occurs. I wake up, arrive on time and make phone calls without incident. Then, I’m chatting with someone new who has messaged me on OKCupid. I haven’t caught her name yet. I’m also chatting with Daisy. Time passes and I haven’t had a cigarette for a number of hours, I’ve only been up here in my room, a place which sort of feels safe except for the fact that I have blinds instead of shades. I fall asleep with the feeling of communicating with Daisy and the OKCupid woman in my head, so that when I wake up in the morning the feeling is still there, so it’s like I still have the impulse to transmit my random thoughts and questions to these people.

    "body": "I arrive at work seven minutes late and without money. Yesterday I pitched in a dollar towards some pizza that people are getting today, so I won’t starve, at least. I didn’t even have more than like three ounces of coffee from the coffeemaker this morning, so I’m not at my most spry. Friday—tomorrow—is a half-day, though, so I’ll be able to get an early start on my latest drive to Massachusetts. I asked Daisy, Why Harvey? Because she hated herself then, was her response, and she wanted to make him better. She had been alone for like three years, not to mention, she mentions. Then my lunch break is over and I’m making phone calls again and people are being friendly and/or hanging up on me and the twenty-something guys in the cubicles near me are being twenty-something guys: “Willie Nelson, thumbs up or thumbs down?” the louder and more athletic one is asking and I give a thumbs up. Later, the other one goes, “No one ever knows the songs I sing here. Levi, do you recognize any of the songs that you hear me singing?” “Yeah,” I say, “I’ve heard you singing, like, They Might Be Giants, a part of ‘Fingertips’. ” “Yeah, I sing They Might Be Giants a lot. Good band. ” Because I was seven minutes late this morning, I can stay for an extra fifteen minutes to have the lateness not go on my record. It’s like after-school detention, kind of. By that time, end of the day, it’s all passed quickly once again. The only records left to call in the databases I’m working from are in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, so it’s almost always a recording, “Please call back during our normal business hours. If this is an emergency, hang up and dial 911. ” I’m like, slouch, slouch, click, click. Yesterday was discount Whopper day, a special deal on the sandwiches from Burger King. I didn’t take part, didn’t write down my name and how I would want my burger and whether I wanted it as a meal, because I had brought a turkey sandwich from the 7-11. I nevertheless got to be a Burger King: the They Might Be Giants chanteur had an extra crown and the more athletic guy said, “Hey, give it to Levi” but it kept sliding off my head (being that I was wearing my headset) so now it’s just there on display in my cubicle—not put together, just a length of cardboard standing up on the little shelf in there. Two stickers had been left in my cubicle by its previous, uh, tenant, one of these stickers reading, “Wow!” and the other, “Great job!” These are now on the little plastic thing into which was slipped the printed-out sheet of paper stating my name, Levi Adams, so that it now says to me daily, “Wow! Levi Adams Great job!” After the shift has finished, I call my mom. It turns out that this is Memorial Day weekend. Who knew? I’m coming up, I say. I get food, plus coffee in the Plymouth Meeting Mall where now people keep sitting next to me on the bench outside, even though there’s like a gazillion tables (probably because they’re waiting for people and have said to them, “Hey, I’ll meet you outside on the bench”). A part of me wants to wander the stores and look at things that I will not buy. Back at the apartment, Jonny calls. He had wanted me to re-record “Extinguish to Vapor”, yeah, but I texted him while I was driving back into the city and I was like, “How about if I just send you the MP3 of the last version I recorded, then write out the tab for it?” He said okay. Now we’re chatting. He thinks he’s going to be playing guitar in a band that dresses up as giant babies and plays something like punk music. The people in the baby costumes are well-connected in the music industry, so he’s excited. (The secret about growing up—what children would never guess—is how very much like ourselves we remain. What was immature about us before is what is mature about us now. People are simple, so long as you don’t try to define them. People are impossible to define: to define something is to own it, and what is consciousness, after all, but the condition of the thing that owns itself? Every day we inherit our dead words from dead people. I love it all. I pop open some red wine and drink it from a Styrofoam cup. I sit out on the front step and smoke a cigarette in a temporary civilization that has been built by burning fossils. Can you believe that? Burning our prehistoric predecessors, we make it to the moon. ) And anyway, a god is just a person seen. I don’t usually drink by myself. I guess I should eat. I have microwavable French bread pizzas in the downstairs fridge. Yup, guess I’ll go nuke me some saturated fats. My door doesn’t lock anymore. I can’t get it to lock. I can’t believe it looks like I left out of my Life Story the story about how in Bakersfield that one time, we were out in this, like, I guess it was out in a cornfield, and I was spinning around looking at the stars and then I fell hard right onto my face and my nose was all bloody… At work on Friday, I take my ten-minute break early. I don’t know if I’ve spoken with this guy before. He talks about how glad he is that it’s a half-day, it’ll let us get a jump on traffic. “Yeah,” I say, “I’m driving to Massachusetts after this. ” “What for? You got friends there, or…?” “Well, I’m from there originally. ” He spent a summer in Lowell, he says. He talks about Boston. I know the drill: being from Mass. , I pretend to know all about Boston. “The guys in the pubs there, they’ll brawl with you over anything,” he says. Dialing, I keep reaching people—a fact that I find annoying, although it does make the time seem to pass more quickly. Four hours of work and then I’m on the road, although not in a hurry. In the morning I wasn’t quite able to bring myself to get out of bed until sort of last-minute, put my laptop in its case and some clothes in a duffel bag and walked to my car with a plastic bag from the Wawa into which I had thrown things like my razor—although not my electric, I broke that—and toothbrush and toothpaste and my contact lenses (which I haven’t been wearing particularly often) and their cleaning solution. Presently you can see me in the same clothes as I wearing yesterday—not a standard practice for me, the clothes being black jeans plus a black shirt, a choice which now that the weather is heating up caused the guy who sings They Might Be Giants songs to ask, “Do you have a gig after this? I saw the way you were dressed, thought maybe you had a night job in a restaurant or something. ” Little beads of sweat on my forehead, I’ve taken out the hair tie to let my long hair down and another work week is over and I am, yes, once again at the Plymouth Meeting Mall to grab some coffee and a bite to eat. What do I eat this time? I forget. As I’m writing this the next day I am going to take a gulp of sparkling pomegranate juice but then in the moment I will forget how to swallow beverage such that I will cough and It will drip from my nose and I will have to go to the public restroom to blow into a tissue and wipe my eyes and just generally collect myself although while it’s happening, while I’m coughing in public, I will be be smiling lest anyone think that I need some help. For now, I’m text messaging Salma to see what her plans are tonight, but she isn’t responding. I look at the atlas and decide to take a different route—202 North across Montgomery County takes me into New Jersey (“No tolls this direction”) (after I get lost for awhile) and then to I-287?, which is at least a highway. I’ve run out of cigarettes, take an exit, stop at a gas station but of course they don’t sell cigarettes. I check my oil, but the engine’s hot so of course it’s hard to tell. Probably I’m due for an oil change, too. Whatever. A quart of 5W30 costs four dollars; I grab one from the small stack between the gas pumps, the attendant gives me change from his pocket. Half of the oil that I pour spills all over the place, but my hands don’t get dirty. I already tried getting off the highway to find cigarettes once before; the sign was all like, “Yo! Gas station this direction!” and I was like, “Sweet!” and then I drove drove drove for about, I dunno, two or three miles before deciding that the sign was just a filthy liar trying to keep me in this random town in New Jersey. After adding the oil I drive farther from the highway. I park in a shopping plaza where there’s a sign for a convenience store, but when I go inside it appears to be a South Asian market instead, sitar music and vegetables unfamiliar to me and from what I can see behind the man at the register, no cigarettes. Okay. It takes me forever to pull out of the parking lot into the traffic. Which direction was it that I came from, again? I don’t know. There’s a Quick Stop. That might be more what I’m looking for, if Kevin Smith movies are any indication. I turn around at the first opportunity. I don’t find the Quick Stop, but at yet another shopping plaza I find a different convenience store. This one sells cigarettes! They’re all priced at never mind more expensive than Philadelphia prices, but more expensive even than Massachusetts prices. I accidentally buy a package of Buy 2, Get 1 Free Newports, thinking that they were Buy 1, Get 1 instead. Whatever. Considering how bad the traffic looked on the highway and how much time I’ve been spending lost, I figure that I had better eat now, so I stop at the McDonald’s drive-thru. Trying to get back to the highway, I’m lost a bit more. Text to Alice: “Lost in North Jersey. ” Okay, this is I-90. If I’m correct, I can take this west and in a few miles I’ll get to I-287(?) again. Oh, good, I was right. It’s late afternoon already. I text Daisy: “Driving to Mass. ” Oh, yeah? She is too. Or rather, she’s passenger-ing—on the way from Syracuse, where her family lives, to Boston for a weekend vacation. “Why Boston?” I text, “Gonna fistfight in pubs?” Daisy texts that pubs do sound good, would I care to join? I reply, “Sure. If I can kick back with a beverage and watch you break people’s noses. Sounds like a time. ” She asks if she should give me a call once she’s there. I say yes, thinking that it would be nice to chat on the phone, not even considering that she might seriously be inviting me to hang out with her in Boston. (Gas prices have risen again. Soon after entering New Jersey I filled my tank, knowing that the average prices here are at the moment the lowest in the nation. Still, I really can’t keep hopping back and forth. ) Julian, via text: “Were you and Britta involved at some point?” My reply: “Almost. ” Julian hadn’t been convinced that Britta wasn’t just shitting him when he referred to me, in somebody else’s presence, as her and his “mutual ex”. Me to Julian: “See? I told you that I have way more exes than I’ve had actual partners. ” Julian texts that Britta said that I ran away when things started to get serious, despite my having seemed to want to get involved with her. Julian opines that it’s amusing how I attract lots of people, “actively don’t date them” and then complain about being alone. My response: “I was afraid of drama. ” Having read much of the early parts of my Life Story, Julian has been inspired—or something—to put together his old LiveJournal entries along with commentary that explains what he was writing about. He wonders, did I read the latest parts that he had sent? (North on the highway, traffic not bad. I occasionally notice that I’m driving slowly, texting all the time. I enter New York state. ) Yes, I did read those, they “reminded me of how young” Julian was. What do I mean? I text, “You were young when we met. It read to me as if every moment of love and beauty was something you felt you had to put your all into keeping from going away. I guess I think you still do. And I think it’s impossible. I think the moments pass and we just have to let them be memories and try to make new, different love, until we’ve gone from this world and the ones we loved can themselves be newly inspired by the memories…” Now he’s off. Nothing has impressed him quite so much as I have, since he met me. Who I am still impresses him, it’s not just the memories. His love for me is always changing. He doesn’t intend to stop loving me. He doesn’t need for me to love him. He would drop everything to be with me. “You’re impossible,” I text. Yes, he prides herself on it. He doesn’t feel that him asking me to accept his unconditional love is unreasonable. He’s not trying to scare me. “I don’t want to have to cut you out of my life,” I say. Well, he’ll have me know, he may be impossible but I’m “hopeless in every sense of the word. ” On and on in this vein, and “I just want to try to see if we CAN be together. ” “No,” I text back. I text Daisy that I’m still driving. I’m near the Western border of Massachusetts by this point: text message conversations take a long time to play out. It’s dark. I’m not sweating anymore. Daisy won’t be in Boston until around 11:30. She hopes that I won’t die driving back home after. “Wait a minute,” I text, “Were you seriously inviting me to hang out with you in Boston?” Well, yeah, if I wanted to. Me: “OMG—that would be insane! I just entered MA by way of, like, New Paltz and shit. And I woke up at 6 AM. I would love to, yes. ” Meanwhile, it’s Britta’s last night in Massachusetts. Alice and Franklin are heading to the shore for the weekend. This girl named Emily who has been living with Gaby and Charlie is going away, too, which is the pretext for the party that they’re throwing tonight, which I was probably going to go to, but now? I’m totally going to drive the length of the Massachusetts Turnpike for an interstate date with Ms. Daisy. Do I want to be in Boston around 11:30 or 12, then? Yes. At a rest stop I put in my contact lenses—kept meaning to do that, kept forgetting. I shave—don’t even use soap, don’t even use water, just the razor against my face. I feel like a teenager again, but I’m twenty-six years old. The next day is a sad day: I wake up sad in Chicopee and remain sad. The quick visit to Boston is now behind me. I don’t know why the chronology breaks: it just does, sometimes. Julian texts. Should he assume that we’re not hanging out today? I don’t respond. There’s a little bird about a foot away from me, eating crumbs. Just now, Salma texted to say that she shouldn’t be able to hang out and why would I want to hang out with her, anyway? Only because I don’t know her, she says. If I knew her, she says, I wouldn’t want to see her. This is her, and she’s sorry to disappoint. Now a woman has sat next to me on this bench in the center of Northampton. She mumbles angrily: “This bench… this bench,” before standing up and walking away. I left a phone message on Lyric and Daniel’s machine last night. Their greeting says, “You’ve reached the number for Brewski the cat, so if you’d like to leave a message for Brewski, please leave it after the beep. ” I left a message for the cat. No response. I’ve been in touch with Amelia as well, maybe we’ll hang out. The woman sits back down on the bench next to me and asks for fifty cents. I answer that I don’t have it. “I am so fuckin’ bored, man,” she says. I get up to walk back to the Starbucks, where I got my coffee. A street musician is playing “The Sound of Silence” on saxophone. “Tough shit, ain’t it?” says the woman, “Massachusetts stinks. I can’t wait to get my check and blow this place. ” Daisy said to me, on a bench by a statue, “Even when it’s just friends, when it’s between a man and a woman, it’s about sex. ” I said, “Well, there’s also the people’s orientations to consider. ” “No, it doesn’t matter,” she says, “It’s still there. ” Before we were on the bench, we were at this bar. I had parked, I had looked at a map of Boston, we had been on the phone trying to find each other. I hadn’t eaten much, and I had been awake forever, so the wine was getting to me quickly. She was in the corner and I was next to her. Sitting at the bar. Pretty nice. A Red Sox game was on the television screen. When we first had found each other on the street, she had said, “You’ve never seen me sober before, have you?” And then talk about death, abuse, mental health—the things you talk about when you’re in your twenties. I tell her about my being a high school dropout, how I flunked out of community college like four times. A sad day, the day when I realize that the area in which I’ve lived for most of my life—full of so many people who were “always” supposed to be in my life—is now, as lovely as it is—”lovely”, the way that I seem “lovely” to Daisy—the past, which I have half-consciously stuck in a box of memories no longer current. “I’m different,” I said to Daisy. As I wrote in a song some five years ago, “They say home is where the heart is/My heart’s a vagabond”. They’re silly lyrics, but true ones. I want a home; I try, as I did with Alix, to be stable and healthy without being alone and wandering. It’s not even the wandering I seek, not even the fun of my stupid little adventures: those are means to an end, the end being a life situation that is not entirely desperate. I inhabit a faux-innocence, because what qualifies as “being experienced” depends on what part of society you’re participating in at the time, and I am always left in the end by whatever I take to be society. I have macro-abandonment issues: it’s not people, but “the world” that always leaves me. Now I see the spare-change woman again. I’m sitting in an alleyway in Northampton. Salma texts to say that what she said was not about me, but about the mood that she had been in. She even calls to reassure me. I appreciate it. I spend pretty much all of the rest of Saturday writing and editing the Life Story. Sunday morning is supposed to be a family picnic; I’m woken up early for it, but then I’m told that Mom are Bruce are all ready to go to the casino to gamble and to see Kathy Griffin perform stand-up. I plan to clean myself up before family arrives, but I get distracted, reading everything that I wrote when Tina first came to the Valley back in ‘01. Aunt Brenda throws a cheeseburger on the grill for me. Chris is also around with his girlfriend. He’s still working on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, went to some sort of training not very long ago in Exton, PA. “You should’ve looked me up while you were in the area!” I say to him, because even though the act of looking in telephone books for residential numbers is pretty much obsolete in the year 2007, the verbal expression is still embedded in my brain. “What, you were in Pennsylvania?” “I still am! I’m living in Philadelphia. You didn’t know that?” He hadn’t known that. I go to see the eye doctor. I like him. He rambles to me about contact lens cleaning solutions, various methods that people have used to sterilize their lens cases, and so on. He writes my final prescription and then I’m off. I work on the Life Story yet some more… pick up Lyric and Daniel… head towards karaoke at Bishop’s Lounge, where, as we’re walking up the stairs, Julian and Ellie and Gayge are just exiting. I only notice them after I’ve passed by. Lyric says hello to Julian for a second. The bar is more packed than I remember it usually being. Gayge returns; it turns out that Julian had forgotten his I. D. , so his and Ellie’s fun was canceled. I sing The Smashing Pumpkins’ “Today”. Lyric, Daniel and I go to the Holyoke Denny’s after. "

    "title": "XIV. Passing through Love Park (23g-24a)",
    "body": "I go to sleep and am woken up around 9 AM by a lively-sounding Salma, who wants to know if I feel up for a trip to Cambridge with her. I drive to meet her in a parking lot just down the street from me. I leave my car there and hop into her passenger’s seat. She is dressed up today, all colorful, but she mentions that in fact these are the same clothes that she was wearing yesterday. She had considered changing but was in a rush to start her drive eastward. Unfortunately, we’re driving westward—oops!—on the Mass. Pike, so she pulls an illegal U-turn. She then drives at speeds faster than the numbers on her old-fashioned speedometer can register. In the blink of an eye it’s time to pay our toll. Salma forgot to bring money, so I pay out of my pocket. She drops me off near Harvard Square, then, where I hang around and eat a burger and fries and drink some coffee until Salma calls and says, Let’s meet in fifteen minutes at Au Bon Pain. We’ll hang out for a bit with Haris and his girlfriend. Okay. Now I’m reading outside of Au Bon Pain. Hi, Salma! Haris is at Baskin-Robbins. We’re going there instead. Here he is, appearing to me once again like a man who is exhausting himself not even so much through his whatsit, his medical pre-residency thing, which is not in his case preceding any residency anyway because he doesn’t want to practice, but it must be exhausting to be Haris, “hamming it up” as Salma would say and also professional. Impressive. One who will give you his attention, ask questions, flattering, engaging, challenging and distracting. This has been my impression from the small bit that we have interacted—the impression that he’s pushing himself not to screw up and say anything dumb that couldn’t be laughed off. After interacting with him, I tend to walk off feeling that I’ve had practice for socializing with accomplished people. Salma looks up to him, feels like a failure in comparison, but is soothed when he’s around. I’ve heard stories about their childhood years. And yes, he complimented me to Salma based on his first impressions. I want to maintain that approval—or if for any reason it has been lost, I want to redeem it. Family is important, I hear. I don’t feel like ice cream. This is a pretty rare occurrence, for me. I get tastes from each of their ice creams, though. Salma’s is Bubble Gum, while Haris has a mix of Lime Sherbert and something else, maybe Mint Chocolate Chip. (Or maybe Haris really is just busy because of all the work that he has, all the business that he has to conduct, all the things, you know, we don’t know what it’s like, people like us, who are used to being without credentials, who were maybe as children told that we were smart enough to become Doctors someday, maybe we were waiting, waiting then to watch the pieces of a doctor fall from the sky to surround us like a wall against poverty and humiliation, but it doesn’t just fall from the sky for anyone but rather the pieces are set there by family or else by our own curious, idle and lonely minds. Only then does society begin to do its work: society will not have half a Doctor. It wants the convincing illusion. Suddenly you’re treated as a soon-to-be Doctor. People believe in you, but you know that really it’s the Doctor in you that they believe. We believe in the Doctor partially because this is how we believe in our health, but to an even greater extent because we also believe in Janitors, Nannies, Bellhops and Interior Designers. Once we are comfortable in our lowly opinions of ourselves as Prep Cooks, Cab Drivers and Factory Workers we will defend to the death this very same fantasy, hierarchy, which weakens both body and spirit, making us victims of the parasite, Identity. ) (I write this the next day, outdoors. I don’t see the insect that I kill. I only see its insides, a reddish-orange on the page. ) Haris’s girlfriend arrives. She seems to be like someone who must be putting her best foot forward both in this world and in a far more interesting intellectual world, the depths of which she figures probably wouldn’t interest us, which is okay because she knows how to be genuinely pleasant without bringing us there. So, she seems like what I think a good grad student should be. Then it’s sprung: “So, Levi is starting his Master’s at Johns Hopkins in the Fall, too. ” It must be said now (if I haven’t said it before) that I maintain a queue of things which I will need at some point to consider, for which I need to prepare myself, and one item in this queue is the fact that I will soon need to speak, to present myself not only as a college graduate, not only as someone who managed miraculously to graduate with honors, not only as someone who has further (absurd, but no more absurd presently than the idea of his graduation had been previously) academic aspirations, not only as someone who is all of these things and at the same time is most accustomed to working at convenience stores and is a failure and a drop-out and is convinced that both the truest education and the truest effecting of change happens on childhood playgrounds, on LiveJournal, in sketchy nightclubs, on playgrounds again as adults watch children and make sure that they don’t fall off the play ladder and one adult is about to touch the small of the other adult’s back to whisper something about the awesome changes in circumstance brought upon us by time while the child is completely safe, but also as a student of what is not by any stretch the most exclusive but is still a legitimate Master’s program at a university whose name, while you’re there, might even eclipse your own name—in sum, a student who unavoidably will need to interact with other graduate students at the same university, a student whom it might behoove to behave in a way that does not make him look like a fool. Haris and Salma have just spent time with their parents. I hear the former speak in an exaggerated accent and I say, “That’s funny, you do it, too. ” I’ve heard Salma use the exaggerated accent before, mostly when quoting her mother but also when she (less commonly) quotes her father. Haris says something like, “And they don’t even really have that much of accents, do they? (He asks his girlfriend. She nods and smiles. ) They do? Really? Oh! Hey, Salma. Did you know that we’re half-Persian? We’re actually half-Indian, half-Persian Afghan. That might be why we don’t look, like, FOB. ” Laughter. Salma turns to me, “Do you know what we mean by FOB? (I shake my head, no. ) Fresh off the boat. ” “Ohh,” I say, feeling stupid. I was thrown off by the phrasing: I thought that they must have had an acquaintance named Fab, or something. In the corridor, we can see out over the city. On the balcony, we can see out over the river. “You could look at this view every morning,” says Haris to his sister, who is twenty-eight years old, “You know, you really should move in with me here. ” “Maybe I’ll see you around campus at some point,” says his girlfriend to me, meaning at Johns Hopkins. Riding home, I remember to myself how long it took for Salma and I to start hanging out. It occurs to me that this is the same Salma I used to never want to get my hopes up about ever seeing again. I still try not to get my hopes up too much about that. Each of our goodbye hugs is like a new and beautiful beginning. I don’t know what this friendship is. I just know that I smile to think of it. She and I speed and swerve off together into the sunset. My summer begins. 24 Julian’s company kept me saying, “Okay, we’ll go here, we’ll go there. ” I enjoyed it most when we were hanging out at Alice and Franklin’s place, watching Wonder Showzen and bantering. Saturday, after driving past the Amish in Lancaster County, it was walking slowly with him behind me on South Street. I ordered a Watermelon water ice and he ordered the same. Not much conversation. Sunday night, I set up a date for Tuesday evening with a woman named Arden from OKCupid. Now it’s Monday morning. Julian’s gone. It’s time for me to get back to work. All of my co-workers seem to easily exceed the productivity standards. I suspect that my biggest problem is thinking too much, spending too long deciding based on the notes for each listing what, exactly, I’m going to say when I call. My monitorings have scored well, no worries there, but today it’s my goal to reach that 40% call time and average of 20 calls per hour, which is what I’m supposed to be averaging over the course of each month. I’m hovering right around there. I’m not minding work today. I wonder what I’ll do with myself tonight after work. Oh, right—laundry. I’ll do that and see how much of Gravity’s Rainbow I can tackle. Reading plan: finish that and The Sot-Weed Factor, then maybe do Ulysses, then leave the long and difficult novels behind me for awhile. This job makes me think a lot about the manipulation of statistics. We input answers to survey questions even when the questions have not been answered; if we in any way interact with an M. D. we enter the result as if we’ve read our entire script to one. Meanwhile, although my daily averages for phone time are always low, my average as listed on the monthly report for May shows me as doing well, at something like 55% phone time and 25 calls per hour. (Maybe the calls that I made before they had me start logging into [the system that keeps track of how many hours employees spend on which projects] figured into the total or something. ) In any case, I’ve never been much one for numbers: they tell stories sort of like words do, but they also seem to me more difficult to understand the truth behind… What am I scribbling about? I think that I know, here in the parking lot at the Kentucky Fried Chicken, eating a biscuit. I’ve been trained on a new project, now, but it’s basically the same thing—same marketing strategy, new product. I still don’t blame receptionists for hanging up on me. I drive through more new places. I buy a coffee from a girl whose unselfconscious spunk I admire, then I forget that coffee on the roof of my car after I’ve stopped at the King of Prussia Mall (a mall that seems too classy for my tastes). (A loud sound outside the laundromat frightens me. ) Salma texts me sadly. Janelle is leaving this Summer to South Korea. Johnny problems. Money problems. Daisy has moved to the upper east side of Manhattan for the Summer with Britta. Zella is proud of me and how far I’ve come. Tuesday morning, it takes me a long time to roll out of bed. I want to call out from work, except that that would require talking to someone. So, I just change my clothes and head out without cleaning myself up. I drive I-76, listening to WXPN, eating a blueberry muffin and drinking coffee. And now, Wednesday morning, I’m in the smoking section of a diner. My cell phone is on the table. (Text message. Julian discussing his new haircut. ) Last night, after work it was driving home, thinking of making a mix CD for Zella. I’ve set up an account at Emusic, have some downloads still to use up this month. Shaving and showering. Mapquesting Arden’s address. Not convinced that what I get is the best route. I drive around West Philly in circles looking for a gas station, finally give up until at the on-ramp for 76 I see—oh yeah, I had forgotten—a place there. A man outside of the store tries to sell me, I don’t know what, perfume or something. I drive to 476, accidentally end up on 276, pull off at the first exit. Toll booth? Woman asking for my ticket. Uh, I didn’t get a ticket. I didn’t even notice going through a toll booth. I was on the Pennsylvania Turnpike? I get back on in the other direction, link back up with 476, take the exit that Mapquest listed. Attempting to follow directions, I’m lost in the Borough of Hatfield. I call Arden. My first thought is that she sounds like Marie, a sort of deep voice, a laugh. She tells me where to go. An apartment in the suburbs by the train stations. She lives here by herself. She’s wearing a dress. Beer caps on the fridge. Open space in the living room. Oh, she’s fun. She gives me beer. There’s a nice hi-def TV, a frameless bed against the wall to be used like a couch. I’m more light-hearted than she was expecting. Conversation goes, goes and before I know it, we’ve been talking on a subject for a while. Her music collection, indexed by the iTunes software on a computer connected to speakers, is huge. She burns me the first Neutral Milk Hotel album, saying they’re her favorite band. I show her how to burn an MP3 CD using RecordNow—I take a bunch of Ani DiFranco, Concrete Blonde’s Free, Aimee Mann’s Lost in Space and I think something else. In the morning, I’ve slept on the living room futon. I’m close to work. I must smell. My bowels are angry at me. I’m listening to the Ani DiFranco. I didn’t hug Arden (who is from South Dakota by way of Tennessee by way of Portland, Maine) goodbye. She said something about meeting up again and I said that I hope so, definitely. I fail to realize how much of a drive it will be to my work. I think I’ve gone too far. My body wants me to get to a bathroom. I make a U-turn. There’s the Germantown Pike. I’m pretty sure that my average yesterday was above 20 calls per hour and my call time above 40%. Past 9:15, trying to get to work, today is already going to be a Late for me. I call out, citing digestive problems. “I’m so hard on myself. I’m so hard on myself,” I find that I’m chanting to myself in the car as I’m driving by a golf course. Last night, when I took off my shoes (after Arden had offered me the sleeping space) I noticed that my right sock had a hole in it. “You’re not jaded,” she said of me. It sort of reminded me of what Daisy had said, that I was refreshing because I’m not “a Chuck Palahniuk nihilist”. Before that, in the midst of our conversation. Sitting, I pointed to a painting on the wall. “What’s the story behind that?” I asked. She was slow to answer—formulating her words, I suppose. “It was… well, I didn’t paint it. ” She stood up. The long earrings that she was wearing—one out of a number of pairs made and given to her by a friend in Maine—swung about. She took the painting from the wall and said, “It’s funny, no one has ever asked me about it before. This… was painted for me. I have it hanging like this, so that it’s like a landscape… mountains. But it was intended to be…” She turned it sideways. She stood there for several minutes with the painting in her hands, talking about how when something is given to you, but you’re estranged from the person… well… what then? She almost wished to see the person again, if only to give the painting back… “I don’t want to get rid of it, don’t want to throw it out or burn it or anything. So I hang it this way—(placing it back on the wall)—and that can give it a different meaning. ” “Who was the person who gave it to you?” I asked. She was sitting back down. “It was someone I was involved with. I haven’t seen her in… a long time. ” She moved to Pennsylvania about a year ago, not knowing anybody. She works for a farm supply company. She goes to shows in the city sometimes, but, at she put it, “It seems like there’s no web site that’s just for, ‘I just want to find people to hang out and do things with. ” She has a cat named Secret. Thursday at work, my supervisor is reviewing with me a call that she monitored. Last week’s totals show me as doing well and today, based on the sheet that gets passed around, I seem to be continuing that trend. He says to me, “When you first finished training and started to call, and you said that you wanted to take an early break, I thought to myself, ‘He’s not coming back. ’ But you’ve hung in there and you’ve been learning. ” Thursday evening, I’m putting together the Portland section of my Life Story. Claudia is once again telling me about her woes, not having friends, having no one to go out with tonight. The last time I tried to hint that maybe hanging out with me would be an option, she made what was either an ill-timed playful jab at me or a slight push away, so this time I don’t bother to try. Earlier, I texted Arden. I asked her what she thought about text messages. She said she liked them. I thanked her for her hospitality on Tuesday night. Hours have passed without any response. I’ll try not to read into that too much. Alice texts that it’s odd, she has been in a good mood lately, while the people around her haven’t been. In the morning, I don’t wake up early enough to shave before work. I shower quickly (without washing my hair) and go. What was it that I had been texting to Alice? That it’s anxiety about loneliness that makes the loneliness really hurt. Arden has texted me, I discover during my first break of the day. “You are very welcome,” is her response to my thanks. We exchange a few more texts throughout the day. I tell her when the soles of my shoes randomly stick to the blacktop. It’s hot outside, but it shouldn’t be that hot! "

    "title": "XIX. Aberrant (1-12)",
    "body": "1 I remember at the age of twenty-one sometimes resenting what I thought of as spoiled college kids—students for whom I would prepare five dollar lattes, who would be charging these drinks to their parents’ credit cards. These were students who would actually smile and refer to themselves as “poor college students” to a minimum wage earner’s face. But now I—the awkward, pensive, artsy loner who never finished high school—at age thirty may be looking at a brighter future than even many of those students are. I think about this a lot, because it’s a shock to comprehend even the idea of, say, retiring someday. And in getting to this point I’ve had to realize that I was luckier, had more going for me, had more privileges than it used to seem I had. I’m probably going to be all right. I have plenty of challenges, still, and I have my quirks, absolutely. Nothing is certain in life, and I’m a pretty weird guy. But I’m a pretty weird guy who has big, feasible ideas; a career path; even a good credit score and an emergency fund. And I know I’ve made progress in life not just because I’m super-awesome, not just because I’ve worked hard and made sacrifices and yadda yadda. I’ve made progress because once I started to see and understand the world in more practical terms, I could see the potential those once-hard-to-recognize privileges afforded me. For almost two years now I’ve been living here in western Massachusetts, working, taking classes, and not having much fun. I’m looking forward to the experience of moving and starting in a Master’s program—getting in was a great success for me—but I also know that I’ll be looking at two more years of hard work in a location that, while it will be better, still is not where I would like to be. So, as someone who does not take pride in what he denies himself, what can I do now to make sure I don’t lose touch with the person I am and the things I want to do in my life? My answer: I cut down on my spending here in the Pioneer Valley and plan a crazy amount of traveling before I move to Philadelphia. For all the different places I’ve seen, I haven’t often in my life taken actual vacations. More often I’ve just, like, up and moved to faraway places and passed through other locations along the way. So in some ways, the idea feels quite new. And to absolutely convince myself that I shouldn’t feel guilty about these travels, I’m making them contingent on my continued abstinence from cigarette smoking. 2 I have books with me during these long overnight shifts, and generally I think of these as better for companionship than anything the television offers. But you know how it is, how the tube just lulls you in. And tonight it’s House Hunters. I like seeing inside houses in different cities. Tonight I’m on the couch, while Penha is in one of the chairs. She finishes up a conversation she has been having on her cell phone and turns her attention to the television. “How much did they say for that house?” she asks me. “Eight hundred ninety-nine thousand,” I say. “For two bedrooms?” “The other places they saw were over a million. That’s in San Francisco. ” “What if they want to have more than one kid!” “Yeah. The kids would have to share a bedroom, then, I guess. ” Although, as far as I might be from affording a million dollar home, it’s even harder for me to imagine just partnering up with somebody wherever I find them, making kids with them, and expecting the local job market to bring us the opportunities we’ll need. 3 I’ve been staying in and doing my best to avoid spending money since my birthday. This means, for example, chatting online instead of going to the World War II Club or whatever. 4 I get to work and am informed that Osama bin Laden has been killed. I sort of take my time getting around to the usual routine of cleaning, because I want to watch the news reports on that. 5 I practice a couple of my songs, load a guitar into my trunk, and drive up to Northampton. Before the open mic at Sam’s is scheduled to start I go to Haymarket, grab a table in the downstairs seating area, and do some revising of what I’ve written so far for my novel, I am a Jelly Doughnut. When I walk upstairs and am heading to the bus tray to drop off my glass, Stephanie is just sitting down at a table. She invites me to join her. For a while, then, she is trying to decide what she is going to do with her night. She has papers to write, but she doesn’t think she’ll get any work done on them. She has been texting with Brandon about their possibly getting together, but it’s not clear what’s happening between the two of them. Her roommates from when she studied in Italy are going to a bar in Amherst, so there’s also the possibility of meeting up with them. Earlier, the weather was bordering on hot. Now, as we walk out of Sam’s, it’s bordering on cold. But it still feels better to be outdoors than indoors. This is Friday night in the center of Northampton, and any open café or restaurant is already crowded, loud, and complicated with the springtime curiosity of strangers. Pulaski Park is small—a small plot of grass, some structures for children to play on and in, plus concrete and benches—but at night, at least, it could still be semi-private as a place to chit-chat. Brandon arrives. We join him in sitting at the same pizza place we just left. At one point, as he gets up from where we’ve been sitting, Stephanie leans over and whispers to me: “Thank you! This is less awkward than it’s been. ” What she means is that having a third party present is lubricating their interactions and making things feel, at least for the moment, a little less awkward. 6 The bar in Amherst, McMurphy’s, is packed full of young college students, including Stephanie’s roommates from Italy. I haven’t been here before. It isn’t the sort of bar I would be likely to go to without someone inviting me. The music is loud. I drink one beer. Stephanie is ready to leave before much time has passed. Surprisingly, though, she is still up for heading to the Deuce (World War II Club) next. We get there, grab chairs at the table where Harry is sitting, and wait for songs that make us want to dance. The dancing is what makes things really fun. In all, it’s a pretty excellent night. 7 I’m hung up on re-counting and re-estimating my budget projections for the years I’ll be spending in Philadelphia. Also still thinking over my planned vacation and having to re-convince myself again and again that I should not feel guilty for it. 8 I go to the Flywheel for the first time at its new location, to see the band Tune-Yards. I use one hour of personal time to postpone my start at work, then do my usual overnight. 9 I stand outside with Lois while she smokes a cigarette. “Good for you,” she says about my continuing not to smoke. I watch some of an episode of Conan (with guest Zach Galifianakis) before turning the remote over to the others and retreating back into the office. I crunch numbers, again again again. I pretty much know my budget for the next twenty-seven months by heart, and I am happy with it, even with the large amounts of money that I am spending this summer on travel. (It’s more than just one trip, now, that I’m planning. ) I’m feeling optimistic in ways beyond what I am willing to put in writing. I have a feeling that my life will improve to an extent it would be ridiculous to explicitly hope for. 10 After sleeping in the morning and afternoon, I meet up with Esther to see a movie. It’s around dusk. The sky looks like it’s about to rain. The movie is Bridesmaids. For the type of movie it is, it’s pretty amusing. It stars Saturday Night Live cast member Kristen Wiig, and in the movie, her character’s best friend, played by the always likable Maya Rudolph, is getting married. But there is another, newer, richer, more glamorous new friend in the life of the bride-to-be, too, and Wiig’s character ends up dealing poorly, and lots of comic, chaotic scenes ensue. I would give more of an opinion on it, but I’m bad at opinions. I’m not even sure why I began writing about the movie if I were going to review it. I will again blame nicotine withdrawal. PERHAPS NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL CAN BE A RUNNING JOKE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. Then it’s Esther and me sitting around in her car in the parking lot. She has something or other planned for tomorrow—I don’t probe, but yeah, it seems like she has been having more mysterious plans that she doesn’t talk about, lately. I drive north to stop by what I know will be post-Trivia Night karaoke singing at the Deuce. I have one beer, maybe two, and sit alone in the not-crowded (because it is not a weekend night) bar. I sing one song, “The Blues are Still Blue” by Belle and Sebastian—a band Esther especially likes. I go back to Chicopee. I was thinking that a couple of beers might help me sleep tonight, but I should have known better. After some hanging around and feeling not at all sleepy, I just get my things together and start the five hour drive south to Philly. The same old familiar drive is the same old familiar drive. Interstate 91 South, connecting to 95 South near New Haven, then over New York City and the George Washington Bridge, then down the New Jersey Turnpike. From a Center City Starbucks I look up information on a couple of the high-rise apartment buildings I’ve been looking into. I walk by them, carrying my black computer bag over my shoulder. I go inside the leasing office for Chancellor Apartments at 13th and Walnut. I get to take a look at a couple of different studio apartments. The views from the higher-level floors are somehow even nicer than I was expecting. I find out which size units are going to be available when, and with this information I already feel like, Whatever, this was just what I was looking for. Then I find my way to the Financial Aid office at Thomas Jefferson University, where I’m happy to discover that my aid advisor is there and able to meet with me. And she both is nice and knows what she is talking about! It sounds like my money situation will be just fine. I walk out of the office and pass a large lecture that is being let out. I get into the elevator. Someone sprints in to join me and presses the “door close” button. I nod and say, “Yeah, I have a feeling the next one up won’t have this much empty space in it. ” I’m finally getting tired. I’ve been awake since I can’t even really remember when. I’m unable to resist the urge to drive up through ridiculous never-ending highway traffic to North Wales. I drive past the apartment I used to live in with Arden—yup, there it is—and the post office across from it, and the regional rail stop. I remember a Holiday Inn in Lansdale; I think I sang karaoke there once. This is my destination. I almost leave to find somewhere cheaper after I’m quoted a price that I find disagreeable. The guy offers me a twenty dollar discount then, though, and I accept the offer. The first thing I do inside is fill up the bathtub. Man, oh man. When was the last time I took a bath, rather than just a shower? I can’t even remember. 11 On Friday morning I drive to the town of Paxton, Massachusetts and find my father sitting outside with a book. He is, I think, showing his age. We go inside and I see Grandma. I haven’t seen her in years. Grandma has cooked a pretty dang elaborate lunch. I’m reminded that I get along well with her. She keeps Lenny/my father in his place. She has a sense of humor I had forgotten about. Grandma leads me around outside to show off her plants and flowers. My aunt Madeline comes over with her daughter, Megan. I haven’t seen them since Megan was, like, a toddler. Madeline is—I didn’t realize this—a CNA now looking to get into an Occupational Therapy Assistant program at Quinsigamond Community College. So, she and I talk about OT some before ending up at the dining room table to go through old pictures. There are quite a few good pictures to be found of my grandfather. In all, it’s a good time. My father is terrible, doing things like repeatedly out of nowhere advising Madeline to get a husband. But the day is not all about him, and he can tell. This is probably why he often steps away and goes to the living room to watch TV instead of hanging out with the son he sees twice per decade. 12 I watch a tornado hit downtown Springfield live on television. Apparently, there end up being two different tornadoes that touch down in Springfield. One of these also hits several other towns, including Westfield and West Springfield, and brings substantial damage to the town of Monson once it’s farther east. My cousin Katie is at work in Springfield when the storm system passes through. Part of the roof is torn off the building that she’s inside? This, just after a killer tornado tore down my father’s street in Alabama. I don’t understand why the tornado gods are going after my relatives. But I still manage to catch an extended nap in the evening before leaving for work. This is important because of my plans to drive to Boston in the morning and catch a flight to Florida. "

    "body": "13 After work I drive to Boston, park at Logan Airport, take a shuttle to what I think is the proper terminal, walk to what is actually the proper terminal, print myself a boarding pass at an electronic kiosk, get something small to munch on at the Dunkin’ Donuts, pull out my laptop for the purposes of charging my cell phone, wait in line to board, board, and pull out my copy of The Tortilla Curtain by T. C. Boyle, which I’m almost finished with. The guy sitting next to me is an ideal guy to be sitting next to on a plane: he literally covers up his head and sleeps for the entire trip without so much as accidentally nudging me. The one other guy in our row, however, seems a bit unhinged and is rude to the flight attendant. An airport is an airport is an airport. Even so, I’m interested to feel the outside, the air, my first Florida sun. A shuttle takes me to the rental car desks. Since this is my second airport shuttle ride of the day, I spend a moment reflecting on the idea of airport shuttles as it exists within my mind. (I am like this; I do this. ) Airport shuttles fall into the category of niceties that I am certain were not designed for me. There is, therefore, while riding in one—even in a crowded one, even when it is not an especially pleasant experience—that by now for me pretty common sense of being an interloper, a tourist, a tourist in the land of tourism because it is that going-somewhere-for-the-stated-purpose-of-just-seeing-and-enjoying ethic that I think I might always feel removed from. I am no longer the kid with messy long hair and wholly inappropriate clothing. I am not standing out like any type of proverbial thumb on this shuttle. Still, I am very much used to the idea that Levi Adams in this sort of environment should be a very funny occurrence. I don’t like the guy at the car rental desk. He presses me about my last name, what kind of last name it is. When I say French-Canadian, he laughs and shares some sort of presumably offensive in-joke with another employee who is there: “Don’t laugh, he’s not actually from Canada. ” Her response is then, “I didn’t say anything!” There is no attempt made by anyone to explain to me what they’re talking about, nor to apologize for their being dicks. Then I’m driving and have no idea where I am. Initially I had thought that I might get a hotel along Miami Beach… but driving around and looking at all the depressing little pastel houses, I don’t feel inspired. 14 To add a new experience to my list of things I have done, I go to a nude beach—Haulover Beach—there in Miami Beach. This is just how it sounds—a beach full of nude people—and I soon realize that although I like the idea of running around naked in a crowded location, it’s the idea of having a day at the beach I am unprepared for. I have no blanket, no sandals, no comprehension even of what it is that people do when people hang out at the beach. (Why is it inherently more fun than sitting or walking around anywhere else?) Not to mention my being alone. So, I spend literally about sixty seconds walking through the sand before I go back to the car and continue driving south. The traffic is awful, but I make it to Key Largo before sunset. Using my phone, I book a hotel room for the night, but because I’m so hungry I don’t bother to check in yet. I find a restaurant on the water, where a band is playing exactly the songs one would expect them to play. There, as I open up my notebook to write inside—that is to say, as I do the same sort of thing that I’ve done wherever I have been for the past fifteen years—it strikes me how silly it is for me to come here alone and to sit under tiki lamps while a strong, damp breeze blows at me and the singer starts singing another mellow-but-manly radio hit I’ve never liked. I eat. I contemplate the humidity. I send out a few texts. I pay my bill, find the Hampton Inn, walk tiredly past children scurrying wet from the pool area, use my card key to get into my room, close the blinds, shower, adjust the air conditioner, unmake the bed, turn on the television, and fall asleep. I wake up in the morning delighted to discover that I have no idea, for quite a while as I lie still in the bed, where on Earth I am. 15 I check out of my hotel and drive. Eventually I’m in Key West, conscious of how far away I am from the place where I will work the night after tomorrow yet at the same time feeling like I have a whole lot of time to kill and relatively few ideas on what exactly to kill it with. I find my way to the hostel easily enough. A sign tells me that it’s too early to check in, so I just park my car, look on my phone for the nearest coffee shop, get some coffee, and sit down to write this. 16 I stand at the southernmost beach in the United States. A board in front of a store advertises the “closest cigar shop to Cuba”. 17 I check in at the hostel. Yup: it’s a bed in a more or less air conditioned room, it gives me access to a bathroom, and it gives me a parking space. That’s really all I was looking for. 18 Hopefully the sunscreen I got does the trick all right. I haven’t actually used sunscreen in years. But, yeah. Key West is different. I love the Internet age: it’s easy now to find a good bar, even in a town I’ve never been to before. The Porch has a nice beer selection, is mostly full of locals though it is located right among all the hubbub of Duval Street… and as I sit here right now with a Unibroue Fin du Monde, “Today” by Smashing Pumpkins is playing at a reasonable volume. 19 But why are there chickens? WHY ARE THERE CHICKENS EVERYWHERE?? 20 One way to get a guy to call you “darling”, I have found, is to buy a James Baldwin book in Key West. 21 Sunset is apparently a big deal here. Masses of people are out, and many of them are, like me, taking pictures. There are also a number of entertainers present, singing and juggling fire and so on. 22 Sort of hurting from walking around, I head back to the hostel and lie down for a few hours. The Internet suggests that the bars along Duval Street stay open as late as four in the morning, and I’ve read about a karaoke place with a midnight sign-up time. Not wanting to lose any potentially fun opportunity here in Key West, I set my alarm to go off at 11 PM. The nap is so-so, interrupted as it is by the various guys in the dorm room coming in. Then I’m at the karaoke place, which is all well and good, except that things are actually wrapping up at midnight, not starting then. (It must be because it’s not really tourist season. ) I walk the walk back to the hostel again, saying to myself that tomorrow night I will do things right! But first I have to get some sleep. That doesn’t prove to be so easy, and around 4:30 I find that I am out and walking again, headed to, of all places, Denny’s. 23 Sleep finally does happen. I wake up on Saturday around half past noon, when people come through the room to clean. Then I go back to the same coffee place—I suppose I am a creature of habit when it comes to getting coffee—and I think about hot, humid weather. Yesterday, having driven into town, eager to see what I might come across here, I really didn’t mind walking around in all this. The stickiness and whatnot were a pretty small price to pay. But, yeah. I would still prefer, like, a Seattle February. 24 Back at The Porch. The Muppet Show is playing on a screen with the volume turned off. 25 What happened next? Well, I seem to recall that I went back to that place—Two Friends, I want to say it was called—that really mellow place with karaoke. It was the same karaoke DJ and the same bartender as the night before. Looking around, though, and seeing that the crowd was basically just a few tables’ worth of mostly middle-aged people trying to enjoy their dinners, it occurred to me that I should probably skip doing the stuff that I would be doing on a typical night back in Massachusetts, anyway. I paid a sort of pricey cover to get into a drag queen burlesque show. I have no special interest in drag performances, but it felt sensible to at least go to one queer event while in Key West. Unfortunately, there was more interaction with the audience than I was expecting. In general, as an audience member, the thought that I might be forced into a show drives me nuts. I don’t even like singalongs. So basically, after a point, I was just waiting for the right moment to slip out the door. I was waiting to go once the queen with the tip bucket went away… but then she was walking around me and I sort of tried to ignore her, and so of course she was trying to get my attention and stuff and then, when I was not responding, she was saying, “It’s like you’re not even here!” and then I just left. I was a little sad to have to miss the rest of the show. Oh, superpower of invisibility, when will you be granted to me? I’m more comfortable with the conventions of dance clubs, so the next place I went to was more comfortable for me. Well… wait. I’m skipping one step. First I climbed some stairs and went (still on Duval) to the Whistle Bar, where I ordered a drink and just stepped outside onto the second floor balcony and as I sat alone feeling the breeze and watching the people below I was thinking to myself, Okay, so this little adventure is almost at its end. And now that I’ve quit smoking for almost a month and rewarded myself for these efforts I can look ahead at what a cigarette-free budget will look like under normal circumstances. I’ve had to push myself to indulge like this, flying on airplanes to places just so I can go there and enjoy myself. It feels sort of wrong, so wasteful. But at the same time, who knows if we’ll even still have things like commercial airlines in two years? Who knows what social unrest, what economic or environmental disaster might lie in store? It might be wise to have these experiences while I can… 	What scares me about the world now is different from what scared me a few years ago. I am no longer so much scared for myself as an individual. I no longer am wrapped up in anxiety about falling between the cracks, living in pain and poverty while the rest of society marches on. I am now scared for everyone based on my observation that no one is in control of this speeding ship we call civilization on Earth and what’s more I am finding more and more as I get older that people—people everywhere, at all ranks, seemingly in all places—are not as bright as one would want to assume. What’s more, I am actually pretty bright, and what am I doing with all my power and intelligence? I am letting myself be a tourist simply for the experience. I am acting as if I were still a teenager in need of exploration. No, no, I think to myself, then, I have to remember that pure asceticism could only starve the individuality that informs my inventiveness. Or something. I should indulge sometimes. And then I went upstairs to the Garden of Eden and its clothing-optional dance floor. I had a swell time, realizing quickly that the biggest difference between this and an average clothing-required dance club would have to be the relative restraint, the cautiousness, the middle school dance-ness of the other clothed people. I drank more—enough to feel sloppy and to begin grinning over-much—and I rocked the dance floor, then. Some gal danced up on me and we were dancing for a bit, but I never got her name. I obnoxiously asked a naked man about where he stashed his clothes. Walking back down (how far? A mile, at least) to the hostel, several people gave me high fives and engaged me in ten-second-long nonsense conversations, because party, I guess. Then I woke up at six in the morning? And I drove all the way back to Fort Lauderdale and waited for a while in the airport there and flew back to Massachusetts and drove to work and made it on time, tired but with no regrets. 26 “Were you in state or out of state?” my mother asks. “Both,” I reply. I don’t tell my co-workers, either, that I went anywhere. 27 As someone who sits through co-workers’ television-watching every night, I can’t wait for this television competition, The Voice, to be over. I’m not sure we really need any more would-be pop stars who’ll just do the talk show circuit for a bit and then disappear. A good singer isn’t that hard to find. Shouldn’t we have, I don’t know, America’s Next Top Primary Care Physician instead? 28 This is heartburn that I’m feeling, I imagine. Oh, well. The way I’m planning things, I will start improving my diet soon. I’ve managed to quit smoking, so I’m pretty sure I can do anything now. 29 The drive down is Philly is nothing exceptional. I check in early at the Travelodge; they say they didn’t mind my checking in early so long as I’m willing to stay in one of the rooms whose doors open up immediately into the check-in lobby. After taking a nap I walk to the comedy club, Helium, and watch Tig Notaro do a standup show, with Kate Micucci supporting. Then I meet with Alyson, and we go to some place neither of us have been to before, for karaoke. 30 The Jefferson orientation is kind of pointless, though. It’s not just for people going into the OT program, but also PT and, I think, radiology or something? 31 Aug. 8, 2011. As I roll over to try to fall asleep at eleven o’clock in the morning, I make the inside of my nostril bleed by lying down and having the arm of my eyeglasses go up my nose while I’m the only guest in a hostel in a small town in Vermont on my way to see Jeff Mangum play in Burlington. 32 I won’t see that group home anymore. I won’t be helping the people who live there anymore. I won’t have to see any more of them die. I no longer work at that job. I can do anything. I am doing it all. I am… meh. I am sleep-deprived inside an airport. Let’s see about maybe napping in a secret corner somewhere. 33 Boston to Newark, New Jersey to flight delays and then a delightful take-off. Clear skies except for the occasional thunderstorm. Lights visible below. Thinking up stories to go along with the lights. 34 Karen is driving around outside the airport terminal when I arrive in Portland. It’s around midnight on a Thursday and she has to work in the morning, so I know not to expect much energy or a long amount of time spent chatting together tonight. We stop for beer at a cute little bodega (for so it calls itself) in which celebratory music is played over speakers at high volume. I am introduced to her new apartment, which is slightly larger than the one she was in before. As I sit on her couch, then, drinking some tasty Indica courtesy of Lost Coast Brewing Company, having one of those so-hello-again conversations with her, going over details of what I am doing now and what she is doing now and what Portland is doing now and what the world is doing now, I am more messed up than I realize because of the full night’s sleep I substituted with naps aboard the buses and planes that carried me from Springfield, Massachusetts along a course to Oregon. Karen gets sleepy and I ask for a blanket and she says, “Oh, I don’t care, you can sleep on the bed too,” and so I lie down there and am asleep about as quickly as I can hit the pillow. And in the morning I actually have a headache, as if I were recovering from some crazy night of drinking. Oh, well. 35 It was a lovely late August morning when I discovered that, to my surprise, Julian was not on time. In the context of the various friends I have had in my life, Julian is not especially unreliable or prone to distraction, so this was kind of like, ‘Hm’. He and I were planning to meet at the Powell’s on Hawthorne. My backpack had set off the security alarms when I brought it inside, for whatever reason, so at least that was being held for me behind the counter. I scampered from one section of the bookstore to another, then, and eventually I got it in my head to stand in front of the store. The sun continued to rise. The humidity became more noticeable. A nervous man who appeared to be in his forties stood near me. A shirtless man who appeared perhaps in his late twenties played the violin a bit farther down. So I said to myself, Okay, I’m going back inside after all and I’m going to sit in the café area until he comes. I ordered some tea and then just about right as I sat down he found me at the table there. Julian! I had seem him once about a year and a half ago, but still it felt as if it had been a really long time since I had existed in his presence. 36 Laurelhurst Park—oh, yes, that’s right. In my mind I wasn’t sure which of Portland’s many parks was Laurelhurst. So, okay, then, it’s this one. I remember dancing around at night here with Kat and Dalileh, don’t I? And then more certainly, more vividly I remember sitting here with Karen back when I was still waiting to have my application for the apartment in North Portland approved, back in ‘09. Now we’re waiting for Julian’s girlfriend, Vivienne, to show, although we know that it is going to be a little bit of a wait. “I feel like Portland is a place I come to where I create significant memories, then leave, then come back and reminisce about the old memories. Again and again,” I say. I make sure to be funny, and Julian laughs. But he also hurts from the times in our past when I pulled away and distanced myself from him. Okay. And he mentions these things, and I feel them in certain moments. Maybe the jokes are going to be all that we have. I don’t know. I have been replacing my life piece by piece. I have been replacing myself piece by piece. We end up joking about how Vivienne will be coming around the mountain when she comes… and riding six white horses. Or driving? Is the character in that song driving rather than riding the horses? Driving six horses sounds more doable. I keep coming back to this subject as Julian and I sit in a tree together. A bunch of young queers, younger than either of us, are gathering near us, on a blanket in the grass. Or maybe there wasn’t a blanket. It isn’t important whether there was a blanket. When she comes, Vivienne has one white horse—a figurine. Ha! I ask her to autograph it. She does. The three of us walk in search of some dinner. Then I realize that I have left my phone at the park. But nobody has stolen my phone! I am relieved about this. Then there is food and hugs goodbye. 37 So then, that first Friday in Portland, Karen and I headed to some place—oh, goodness! I forget where it was—and we managed to find a table outside and we began drinking delicious beers and then Amy and Amy’s girlfriend Jenny and a couple of other gals came by. I ended up engaged in an energetic conversation with Amy about Neutral Milk Hotel and Jeff Mangum, which stemmed from a conversation, I think, about Karen’s taste in music and how maybe Amy just assumed that my taste in music was the same as hers, but then we were talking specifics and that’s how Jeff Mangum’s name came up and so on and so forth. I was telling her about the experience that I had recently when I took a night off work to drive to Burlington, Vermont and see the first night of Jeff Mangum’s tour following his long stay in not-wanting-to-be-a-public-figure-land. The microphone died at one point, and then it was a bunch of us there in this two-hundred-capacity church gathering around to sit on the floor and sing along to “Two Headed Boy, Pt. 2”. And I met him after, got his autograph, shook his hand and talked for a minute. And here in Portland, remembering that night, I mentioned excitedly how he had covered Daniel Johnston’s “True Love Will Find You in the End”, which got her girlfriend Jenny going about how amazing the documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston was. 38 And now I’m in Hawaii?! 39 At Island Vintage Coffee in Waikiki, Honolulu, where I may or may not have just ended up in a picture taken by a young blond-haired woman with a flower in her hair at the table nearest me. I am here doing what it is natural for me to be doing here in Hawaii—sitting at a coffee shop and writing in a journal. But here is something that I would not have expected: I am not the only one here doing that! There is a man (and we will say he is in his mid-to-late twenties) and he is Caucasian and he wears his red hair short. And I do in fact believe that this is the second night in a row I have seen this guy here, at this coffee place in Waikiki! In Kerouac’s world, I would saunter over to him and ask him where to find the real Honolulu scene. He would know Cassady or Ginsberg and we would next end up on some ledge overlooking the Pacific waves.  But this is my world, the world of Levi Adams, so I just keep writing instead. "

    "body": "40 This whirlwind trip has been a great success, even if writing about it has not been. I actually rented a car and drove around most of the island—that was fun. And then I went to see Paramore in concert, because when I searched online for events that were happening in Honolulu I saw that and thought it would be fun to go and do something that the locals might actually be doing. I could see the entire performance quite well even as I stood next to the bar with no one behind me, because I am six feet tall and the crowd was mostly fifteen year old Hawaiian girls. Yay! I rode the city bus back to Waikiki. I had checked out of my hotel overlooking the water and was now in a hostel. In the hostel room, it looked like there was some guy already in the bathroom. I just made up my bed, then, and was almost asleep when some other guy came in, grabbed a surfboard—this at eleven at night—and said to the guy in the bathroom, “My bed is yours tonight. I’m not coming back. ” I slept for maybe an hour and a half, then, in that warm and not-air-conditioned room, before a bunch more people returned and got into their beds. I didn’t manage to fall back asleep after that. I actually forgot to check out—just talked to a taxi driver through his window and asked about going to the airport. Now the airport is not open yet. Really? I didn’t think international airports closed. But they’ll be open around 4 AM, and I can wait outside until then. This is Hawaii, so the temperature in the middle of the night is just fine, so okay, then. 41 When I try to get a boarding pass, the machine tells me there is an error with my ticket. I wait for the customer service station to open. Once I get to speak to a person there with Hawaiian Airlines, she tells me that the problem has to do with there not being a ticket number, and she says that since the ticket has numerous destinations on it and is under the control of US Airways, the person I really need to speak with is someone with US Airways. I’m given a phone number for that airline, then. I call it. A recording tells me that I have a twenty minute wait ahead of me. Five minutes in, the call drops. I call back. A recording tells me that I have a thirty minute wait ahead of me. I wait for a half hour. I reach a customer service agent who seems like a nice enough guy. It takes him some time even to find record of my flights, but once he has done that he is able to give me a different confirmation number, this one for US Airways instead of Hawaiian Airlines, and he tells me to go to one of the US Airways kiosks to print out a boarding pass. But, nope. That machine gives me an error, too. I call U. S. Airways back. A recording tells me that I have a ninety minute wait ahead of me. I stand in line and explain my ongoing situation to someone else at the Hawaiian Airlines counter. I am so tired. Really when I took a cab to the airport at three in the morning what I was expecting was a series of brief naps in the airport followed by a chance to wander or whatever during a six hour layover in Maui, then a long flight back to Portland during which I could mostly sleep. I had not been expecting super-stress-ongoing-frustration time. The person at the counter calls someone else who, it is said, is calling US Airways on a different line. I still have the same old repeating recordings of the US Airways answering system playing on speakerphone. I wait, sitting on the floor. I’m called over by the Hawaiian Airlines guy, and I am told that according to the US Airways people my ticket is not valid and there is no further information available. I ask, Well, why isn’t it valid, and I’m told that oh, y’know, things like returned payment or fraud or just, it’s a bad ticket for some reason and I’ll have to take it up with that airline, not with Hawaiian Airlines. Whenever I’m sitting outside rather than inside the terminal, the same security person who has been there since I first arrived keeps coming around. I feel bad that my unpleasant, harried, frustrated, sleep-deprived attitude eventually pushes him away. Finally I speak to someone on the phone at US Airways who says that she’ll try to get the ticket exchanged. Then she comes back on the line just enough to say that she is transferring me to someone, and a woman with the thick accent of a resident of India—(an accent Americans seeking telephone customer service have come to know well in the past decade or so)—comes on the line and just says, “I understand you wish to speak to a supervisor” and just says, “I apologize, but when you did not take the first flight on the ticket it invalidated the other flights” because yeah, I bought these tickets way in advance and changed things around about my itinerary and various destinations, so I was planning to only use the return leg of this multi-destination ticket, but apparently I can’t, so now I have nothing left to do except give up and sit there outside on a stool-type thing under palm trees at the Honolulu Airport just wanting to sleep please please please I just want to sleep at this point. I take a taxi back to the hotel I was saying in, and I get another room, where I use a credit card to buy a new ticket back to Portland. (No convenient six hour layover in Maui this time. ) 42 Eventually I make it back to Portland, albeit a day late, and that is where I am now. Specifically, I am at Peet’s Coffee and Tea on Hawthorne, sitting at a table by the window. I’m getting distracted by the conversation the employees here are having. They always seem to be talking about something that interests me… because, I guess, of the weird way in which Portland is my culture, even though I haven’t spent all that much time here. I’ve left Karen back at her place so that she can have some time alone or whatever. But maybe I’ll check in with her, now. 43 I bring Karen along to meet with Julian, and we go out and drink, and that’s fun and whatever, and then I’m on an airplane to San Francisco. 44 I love the weather here in San Francisco, all the mist and whatnot. Breezy and, I would say, around sixty degrees. But, I don’t know. I sure did have to walk by a lot of fancy places today before I could locate either a restaurant to get a cheap bite at or a place to just drink some coffee and write. 45 Burgermeister, this place is called. I swear I did not mean to plop myself in the middle of beat central here in North Beach, around the City Lights Bookstore and all of that. 46 I hate to say it, but I’m a bit bored at this point… eager to move ahead to Philadelphia. But, you know what? That’s a good sign that my vacation has done for me what I was hoping it would. Right now I am in Berkeley, California, at People’s Café, just outside the UC Berkeley campus. Walking around this town this morning—(it is now just past noon on Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2011)—I already passed by Berkeley City College and was reminded of the time back in 1998 (yessir, thirteen years ago) when I was staying a few towns over from here with the parents of Maxine, a girl I met on the Internet, and I (being seventeen years old and not especially skilled at thinking my plans through) applied there, thinking that I would take classes and find somewhere to stay, thinking I would get an apartment somewhere in Berkeley with Maxine… …Oh! That sandwich the server here brought out for someone looked pretty delicious. 47 I feel like I’m starting to notice a trend as my first days in Philly end up being too packed for me to ever get around to writing about them. It all happens, though: things get moved in, somehow, and I go to stores to buy necessities (and luxuries) and then there is a not-great lunch date with a hungover med student from OKCupid, and then there is Welcome Day (on which I get my ID and listen to some more faculty hellos), and then I walk around the Rittenhouse Square Barnes and Noble for a bit on a pleasant enough date with a writer named Honor, and then there is my first day of classes, and then I have some time to kill while waiting for a calzone between my two classes of the day, so I use that time to write this. 48 I go on another date. Then I start to realize how time-consuming this semester is actually going to be, and I figure I should try to de-emphasize the socializing stuff. 49 I’ve been doing light exercise at the gym most days. My diet is all over the place, easy to prepare, full of simple ingredients, and often just kinda weird: mahi mahi burger with mixed greens and unseasoned ramen noodles on toasted white bread copyright twenty-eleven all rights reserved. Also, coffee and beer and seaweed snacks. (Yes, at the same time. Duh. ) In a cohort of around sixty occupational therapy students I am one of, I believe, five men. Also perhaps the second oldest student. Mostly my classmates are overachieving, Christian, athletic young women in their early-to-mid twenties. Which is a demographic I only ever really saw previously when I would drive by them and they would be jogging; a demographic that always takes “home” to mean “where Mom and Dad live”. But there is nothing awful about these being my classmates. I’m happy to be here. I love the field I’m going into. I also like most of the faculty, although I had a sort of horrifying experience in the first lab session for my Anatomy class. I didn’t realize that I had been expected to prepare for that first session, and the lab instructor responded to the fact that I was slow to find answers to the questions in the workbook. Maybe it had something to do with what the expression on my face looked like; I don’t know. I think I was sort of tired at the time. The woman kept coming back around to me and asking if I thought I was going to have a hard time keeping up with the work. At first I smiled politely and explained that no, I had just made a simple mistake by thinking that the homework listed under “week one” on the syllabus would be due after the first week’s classes rather than before them. Then I had to tell her that no, I didn’t have any specific questions, and that in fact I did better when left to work out answers myself. Finally she took me out into the hall and asked if I was going to need any special accommodations. I told her I didn’t understand why she was singling me out, that I was embarrassed, that all I could say was I had been unprepared for class and I would make sure in the future to do the assigned workbook pages before class. A classmate asked after class if I would like to study together sometime, but I was so shaken and self-conscious that I said “No, no, no,” assuming in the moment that she, too, was thinking I was in need of special help. Other classmates have made comments about how much they like this lab instructor, but I find it hard to forgive her after that first day. I may or may not get an actual internet hookup for my apartment tomorrow. There is no way to fully describe how awful the process of trying to get DSL connected has been. 50 “I dreamed that I had a dream about you,” I say to Edith. “And then I dreamed that I woke up and told you about the dream. Then, I think, I dreamed about you smoking pot?” “I don’t think I’ve smoked pot in years. ” “And I dreamed about the cold cream in your bathroom. ” “What did we do with the cold cream?” “Put it on our faces, I think. ” “Well, that is a weird dream, then. That stuff is so heavy I’ll only use it once in a while, like if I have real serious makeup to take off. ” “Yeah, I think it’s because it’s Pond’s, and I use Pond’s moisturizer for my face. ” Then she’s doing yoga in bed. The mid-morning light shines through curtains into Edith’s second-floor apartment in South Philly. I half-heartedly try to do the same poses: “Ow. I feel like I’m doing them all wrong. ” “Maybe you are. ” “I don’t emulate well. I just have my own yoga poses, I guess. Like this one, see? This is the…” (I give an obviously made up name for a yoga pose. ) “I’ll hold that one for a second…” But it’s only me I’m entertaining. She is actually focused on doing yoga. At some point in conversation the night before, she said to me, “But see, you, you were rebellious, while I was the President of all the extracurriculars at my high school. All of them. Except student body President, I was never that. But otherwise, all the extracurriculars, I was President of them. ” I didn’t remember what she knew and didn’t know about my teenage years. “Rebellious?” “Yeah, you had that streak in you. ” “I guess I rebelled, but I was rebelling against a… terrible path. ” In the morning at a coffee shop we play with each other’s hands. “See you later,” she says as we part. 51 Saturday in Philadelphia. A band’s soundcheck sounds like it’s coming from the next room, although it is actually happening sixteen floors down and half a block from my building’s entrance. Why the street is shut down today I am not yet sure, but I also see from my window crowds of people walking past tents. I walk outside, still don’t see what the festivities are supposed to be for (and don’t feel like going into the crowds to find out), so I head to a different neighborhood to find a place to read. 52 In the midst of lots of busy-busy school business I spend another night with Edith, after cooking a delicious mix of vegetables with her. A couple of nights later, I see that she has posted some photos of her hanging out with friends, and who is in those pictures but Peggy, an old LiveJournal friend I once visited in person during a trip to Boston, who just happens to be close friends with this new person I met through OKCupid in Philadelphia. 53 I find myself trying not to be offended that I’m not in super-consistent contact with Edith—that her actions are in line with her words, and that her words are all talking about being casual. When you’re like me and don’t have family members you feel close to, you maybe sometimes end up clinging to that sense of similarity and commonality that you find in certain people when you chop vegetables with them and then spend the night with them and then later wake up and get coffee with them and then kiss them and then walk away from them and then try, out of respect, not to think too much about them. It admittedly gets to be like, Argh. Stop it, brain. Think instead about the muscles involved in supination of the forearm vs. those involved in pronation, or something. 54 I’m inspired by the good and bad, but mostly by the bad—the aloneness and hurt—to think about pushing forward and trying to do things for this dumb planet and its dumb people. I can’t change the cruelty of normalcy, the entitlement of affluence, the abuse by the powerful. I can’t make us Americans more thoughtful. I can’t stop us humans from destroying ourselves. What I can do is remain defiantly confident, just enough to take a place in society, to work, to love, to have leisure, to be creative. To refuse to settle for the role of the impossible. To enjoy something other than laughing away the less fortunate. To not fuck with others’ dignity. I have days when I feel messed up, but then I look at just about anyone who passes me on the street and I realize, Oh, shit. I’m actually miraculously okay. What I am seeing and fearing in myself is weirdness, yes, but “aberrant” can in fact be an essential part of “capable”. We’re dying, and some people are always going to be dicks and cause horrors, and maybe we can tell those dicks to fuck off and while they’re distracted and arguing over reality television or philosophical minutiae or who gets to run what power structure we can steal their knowledge and hand it off to some new, more inspired folks who will do something else stupid with it but with novelty create new hope and why should we not prance along in this mode, evasive, while signs of age begin to show on our skin, hopefully not as alone in our maturity as we were in our innocence? Whatever. Today I can eat and learn and plan great things and entertain myself as much as I want. 55 My advisor, talking to me about the Pacific Northwest, said, “It’s beautiful out there,” and I agreed. “But,” he added, “I haven’t been back there to visit for about eight and a half years, now.  I’d like to. ” “I was just in Portland this summer visiting friends,” I said. “Ah, Portland. Did you eat a lot of doughnuts and smoke a lot of cigarettes?” “I did neither. I did walk outside of Voodoo Doughnuts… but then I remembered, ‘Oh, right, there’s a line to get in’, and skipped it. ” “And that’s also where the Church of Elvis is!” “It was! That closed down, though, a number of years back. ” But mostly, this meeting was him reacting to a recent class of his during which, when we were doing small group work, he saw me sitting in my own row behind a few other students, for the most part doing my own work instead of trying to worm my way into what my peers were doing. In retrospect, I could have just said, “English major habits die hard” to explain it, since working alone is how most of the work is done in those classes. I am used to different ways of studying than all the Biology, Exercise Science, and even Psychology majors. But I let him probe. That was fine, too. “In the evening seminar, though, during our one meeting you seemed to take the role of leader in your group. ” “Yeah, I did. ” “What was different there?” I shrugged. “It just depends on the situation, I guess. ” I’m falling asleep as I try to write about this, but yeah. Then he was talking about how clinical sites would eat someone alive for being “different”. And I tried to explain that I have lots of work experience, but it was before 9:00 in the morning at the time, and I was still working on my first coffee, so we mostly just ended up talking about Portland instead.

    "body": "56 Me: “I’m glad to hear you talk about us seeing each other again. ” Edith: “You had doubts about that?” Me: “Well, yeah. ” Edith: “Of course we’ll see each other again. Hopefully I’m not frustrating or confusing you. Even if I have boundaries. ” Me: “Well, you have no way of knowing this, but… the ways you’re worried you might be frustrating or confusing me? I think, like, that’s usually me. I think you might be… being frustrating… in a way that I’ve seen in myself. ” Edith: “Maybe that’s why I like you. ” While she has been watching taxi after taxi pass by, all of them occupied. After a longer-than-planned night out, seated on bar stools after a comedy show. She drank cocktails; I drank absinthe and then beer. Her clasping my arm while we walked. After first saying no to my offer of having her over, then my hesitantly raising the possibility again—(we tried for several minutes but were having difficulty hailing a taxi in the inclement weather)—she came back to my place, went right to sleep, and left early in the morning. 57 Then, for the first time, I met Allison in person. We met at The Bean on South Street. It was a necessarily brief daytime hangout, as she was on her way from the makeshift library at the Occupy Philadelphia protest and on her way to work. We seemed to get along. 58 My Anatomy and Kinesiology grades on the first exam and practical? Not so good. Now I’m preparing for a similarly intimidating first exam in my Health Conditions class that will be happening on Monday morning. My dreams of taking regular weekend trips out to New York and all that sort of nonsense are now seeming sort of impossible. But! In addition to the inter-professional program for doing things in Rwanda that I went to the meeting about a couple weeks ago (that would have me possibly traveling there next summer) I have been in touch with the fieldwork coordinator about doing my two-week fieldwork placement after the end of the spring semester be at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. All these ridiculous opportunities are more incentive for me to do whatever the hell I have to do, but to keep going and go to push, push, make it happen. 59 I asked Allison to go see Wild Flag with me. We went and had an excellent time, and I rode her pink bicycle, and I wore her scarf through Chinatown at midnight. And in my apartment I was falling asleep on her, and we slept in our clothes. Still, I’m human. Still, I worry about finding someone who’ll stick with me. 60 I start my first Level I fieldwork at Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. To get there, one day a week I ride the elevator down to the first floor of my apartment building. Then I walk past the person at the security desk, exit the double doors onto 13th Street, take a right, walk to the end of the block, and bounce down the stairs (I like to bounce) to where I catch the train. The train travels below Center City before emerging into the early morning light and carrying me over the wide Delaware River. From the appropriate station in Camden I walk a couple of blocks. The fieldwork is in acute care. I follow the OT or sometimes her COTA (certified occupational therapy assistant) from room to room as people who have very recently experienced trauma or been through surgery are seen. Usually the sessions are done as combined OT and PT. In this case, the PT who is usually working is a contractor signed on for a temporary assignment. He seems both kind and competent, like the OT. The COTA is awful, though. During a lunch break, she sits at a table with me and with an OT fieldwork student from a different school who is in another department. Not looking at me, she says to the other fieldwork student, “I wish I could work with a student like you. You’re not like some of the students we see here, who don’t know how to act around patients and lack basic clinical skills. ” The other student is visibly nervous about how to respond to what was obviously an unprovoked jab at me, the quiet guy in scrubs sitting across the table eating a sandwich, so that student changes the subject to something about the curriculum she’s studying. This is wise, I think, and what I would have done. 61 Then I meet up for the first time with someone else from OKCupid—Brianna, an introverted but warm graduate of Mount Holyoke College. She’s great, and I have a fun time walking around the city with her and going for beers and whatnot, although I’m thrown by how young she seems to me. 62 There isn’t really time for the dates I’ve been agreeing to. This makes it feel like even more of a bummer that my date last night (to see an advance screening of Martha Marcy May Marlene) turned out to be one of the most pretentious human beings I’ve ever met in my life. 63 Brianna plays viola. We meet up with the intention of seeing how we might work together as a musical duo, with her on that instrument and me on ukulele. (But first we’re on the couch, cuddling, and she kisses me and I don’t resist, and I like the feel of her close to me and the genuineness in her eyes, but she exudes what I read as inexperience and it makes me hesitate and I smile and suggest that we get going to the park. ) 64 Brianna and I see each other a few more times. She takes me to an Eritrean-Ethiopian restaurant in West Philly that she frequently goes to for karaoke. I remember going to the same place with Bluejay back in ‘07. It feels about the same as I remember it, a fun mish-mash of folks crammed together. We also decide one night that we would like to rent a movie. However, because it’s the year 2011, there is only one place near my apartment that still rents out movies, and that is a gay porn store. The gay porn store carries a small number of non-adult titles, though, so we manage to find something there. 65 I’m actually really liking Philadelphia this time. 66 Nov. 6, 2011. Seeing Jeff Mangum play back in August, in Burlington, Vermont, at the first show of his first tour since his band became widely known, was great fun. When I think about Neutral Milk Hotel I think about that random stranger at Fire &amp; Water who spoke to me at length about the band, back in 2000 or 2001, and who wrote the band’s name onto a slip of paper that I still have. I think, too, about Bailey, who in 2002 burned me a copy of the second of their two albums. Then there was the “vision quest” which, because of a miscalculation in the number of credits I had earned, I needed to go on in 2004 in order to graduate from community college on time: after a few days spent alone in solitude in the forest the group of us re-assembled, and one guy borrowed my guitar to play “In the Aeroplane over the Sea” from the album of the same name. And of course there is my ex-girlfriend Arden (whom I was with in the years 2007-2009): she cited them as her favorite band and burned me a copy of their first album, On Avery Island. So, yeah. After a point, it’s not just about the music anymore. The feeling today is that I know who I am. And who I am is connected to the rest of the world, in a way that should just be part of the human experience but which, for me, just leaves me in awe. I mean, I always just hoped that I and mine could find stores to work at forever and that we could keep our emotions from destroying us and that we could pay rent reliably while living in one of the unremarkable little towns around where I was born. But here I am in Philadelphia, linked in to America and participating. Seeing that I can choose what I put out there. Me. Without shutting away my past. I look out my window at the city and see that I and the peers I’m beginning to meet are coloring what it means. This major city is, in many meaningful ways, ours. A long and amazing history, and it leads up to and includes us. Who we are. What we are afraid of. It all becomes a part of this one city. And it’s not just Philly. It’s the United States. It’s the world. It’s Edith planning the books she wants to write. It’s Allison spending her days at Occupy Philly. Brandon getting arrested at Occupy Wall Street, and Maurice there, too. It’s Salma speaking at a protest against rape culture despite her anxiety over public speaking. I, meanwhile, spend my Thursdays on the acute care floors of a hospital. A woman with brain cancer for a moment stops thrashing around in bed when she looks me in the eye and says that she knows me from somewhere. I am confirmed to do my fieldwork for next summer at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. You can’t separate the meaning from the memories. And you can’t separate the memories from the people. And you can’t separate the people from the meaning. 67 On South Street, after I saw a rad and in its own way inspirational show (Frank Turner with Andrew Jackson Jihad), I found myself sitting outside on a step (while waiting for Allison to come along and join me for a post-show trip to a bar) five teenagers stopped in front of me and the leader, a boy, asked if he could talk to me for a minute. I was feeling pleasant and had time to spare, so I said sure. I was expecting some kind of canvassing, or a survey or something. He asked if I lived in Philadelphia. Yes. What did I like about it? Things to do, good public transportation. What were its problems? Poverty. What needed to be done to improve it? Opportunities for employment and safe environments for poorer families to live in. In my opinion, did churches mostly do good for the city, and could they be effective at helping to fix the city’s problems? I said I didn’t know. The boy asked if I identified myself any particular way in terms of religious belief. I said, “Atheist”, and their feet shuffled. I was asked if I thought we all just became “worm food” at death and I said, “Yes, but I wouldn’t put it that way. I don’t look at it in that light. ” I was asked if the non-existence of an afterlife didn’t make life seem meaningless. I said that no, in fact, I thought this perspective was some of the impetus for my acting now, in the present, rather than living for what I expect to come after. But why, I was asked, would I want to do anything at all to make the world a better place, if life just ends in nothingness? I said that I couldn’t say for sure why I want to accomplish things and be a good person, but that in my experience there is something in us humans that does make us inclined to want to both improve our world and be a part of a community. Maybe, I said, they, being believers, would call that drive to goodness something that comes from God or from Jesus, but I think it’s practical for people to want to be good. And I don’t think my wanting to do good in life is a strange thing. (I think most of the cruelty we see in the world results from habits and rituals being perverted. I see the existence or non-existence of social rewards for cruelty as a more important topic than the existence or non-existence of any deity. ) Allison showed up while the Christians were still there. They pushed her about her own beliefs, but just she said with a sigh that she wasn’t in the mood to deal with the questions. I think we do need to shake that insidious idea that kindness and charity are the exclusive domain of the religious. Allow me to propose a philosophy that says, Fuck it, I’m going to stand for decency and the defense of human dignity—and the only way I know how to live this way is to draw a distinction between the reasonable and the supernatural. (What I hear referred to as “spirituality” I know as poetry, mystery, harmony, all those qualities we humans try in vain to possess, all those qualities that lead us to humility. ) Then Allison and I drank alcohol, and we shared a bed for the third time. I again did not risk trying for a first kiss, because, although trying for a kiss would be the normal thing to do, why should I do that when in the moment I’m already happy? 68 I go with Brianna to see Kimya Dawson play downstairs at the First Unitarian Church. 69 Nov. 19. Oh, Philadelphia. I’m having to freak out while living inside you… once again. It’s hard to say why I’m, um, not managing to get the grades I would need in order to stay in the program at Jefferson. But I will mention that whenever I’ve spoken with my advisor, Davey, about my grades and why I’m getting, like, ‘C’s on papers when historically I’m an ‘A’ paper writer, he gives vague justifications, suggests no real strategies for bettering my grade, and then says, using slow, cautious language, that occupational therapists need to blend in, and that “as much as we talk about, say, getting more men in the field, OTs don’t actually want more diversity. There are ways that you’re expected to be a man, while at the same time these other OTs will be wondering why you don’t do things their way, that is, in the way of a profession that’s majority-female…” Early on I missed some small assignments, as I got the hang of where assignments were described and how to keep track of them all. This started me off poorly. Now I have to figure out what happens next… I sort of lost hope yesterday, when I got back an assignment in a class and saw a stupid number of points taken off unreasonably, seemingly at random. (Sadly but fortunately, me against the world is the game I know best. ) 70 Old City is, in many respects, a great place to go for a walk with your iPod playing as you think about your life. But it’s also where all the tourists are coming through on duck-shaped boat-buses and in wagons pulled by horses. So, beware, if you think you’re going to have a quiet moment alone with the almost-too-nice November Saturday you’re stepping out into. Anyway. How to put this? The fun moments of recent weeks would probably feel stellar if things in my life did not seem so on the verge of reverting back to their normal—that is, desperate—state. I ran away as a teenager and at essence I’m still on the road, even as I try with varying levels of success to reap the benefits of—as they used to say—the straight world. Have I written about what Davey went into, his whole story about his “semester in beige” when he was an OT student? Something about, he was going to drop out, but then the Dean wouldn’t sign the paperwork to let him drop out, and instead the young Davey was told to try to blend in, to “dress in beige”—and so he did. “And then,” he added, “I went through years of therapy to get over it. But my financial investment paid off. ” It was clearly a story he had told before, but knowing that still didn’t tell me whether or not his relating it to me was a message I would do well to decode. After all, Why am I getting these crappy grades on all my written assignments? The comments he gives sound like excuses rather than critiques. So, I think I have to get out. If I withdraw, I withdraw passing. I just need an explanation and I should be able to start in a program somewhere else… …where I will be sure to lie about my back story. Yes, I will lie, lie, lie, and I will have all papers be looked over by whoever offers that service on campus, and I will join all study groups and give the appearance right from the outset that I am, yes of course, not merely docile and articulate but also normal, oh so normal, with tropes of middle class suburban guyness evident in my every word and expression. Because I have been through enough that I can handle more than one semester in beige. (Oh, hey, there’s the rollerblading trumpet man passing by as I sit outside and write. He sure does spend a lot of time outside in Center City, trumpeting on rollerblades. ) I can’t trust the faculty at Jefferson with the power they have over students. This may be a problem at other schools, too, but at least now I know to be prepared for that. Aaargh. "

    "body": "71 Nov. 29. I was struck by an article in the new issue of Rolling Stone about an exceptionally gifted kid who is now thirteen and an engineering student. Remarkably, this is not just some article that says, “Isn’t he amazing!” but rather, it comes right out and says that this kid is really lucky to be getting the opportunity to learn at his level. “The prognosis for exceptionally gifted students in America is poor,” the article says. I kind of never thought I would see that truth in print. But, yeah, it’s interesting in this light to think of my current situation with the OT program at Jefferson. This is yet another episode, really, in the ongoing story of me trying to act normal—the story of “acting normal” as a challenge much, much more difficult than that of absorbing information, showing inventiveness, or honing any other skills. What now? Well, I’m still going to class each day, even though I feel pretty certain now that I can’t make this thing work. This is not going to feel good, this having to find work and so on. 72 Saxby’s, Rittenhouse Square. Staring out the window at the falling rain. I look online at job listings but cannot even imagine. Because that was not where I was heading in life, y’know? Must not die. Must not die. I can’t believe I’m in Philly for no reason now. 73 Nov. 30. Instead of going to my morning class I sat inside the Starbucks at South and 9th, two tables and two chairs away from some guy whose chiseled features and confident manner made me fantasize, between the glances I happened to catch of him, that he might be some famous actor, like a Bruce Willis, somehow not recognized by anyone else, either, sitting in Philadelphia and unknowingly sharing this heavy morning with me. Because it was a heavy morning. I knew at that point that once it was around 11:00—(I had looked at Davey’s schedule)—I would be heading over to the Edison Building of the campus of Thomas Jefferson University in order to say to him, “I’m going to withdraw from the program. ” It’s hard to know what I should write down about the meeting, now. Davey was as determined as ever to describe his intentions as the program director as if it they were something abstruse: “You were saying something, the last time you were in here, about the differences between graduate work like what you’ve done before and a professional program like this. I think that’s the right thing to take from all of this—that you weren’t expecting you would need to work on your professional skills in the way we’ve been asking you to. ” He interrupted me when I mentioned that having this conversation was emotional for me: “This is you being emotional?” he said. My response to this was, “Well, this is me being adult and professional about an emotional situation. ” “Well,” he continued, “You look really calm. I wouldn’t think that this was really affecting you. ” I will be glad, at least, that I won’t have to try to read into how that man is judging me, anymore. 74 Dec. 5, 2011. 12:30 PM. Start coffee. Get into shower. 12:37 PM. Done washing my body, but before I get to shampooing, the water suddenly gets unbearably hot. Never mind for now: I don’t feel like playing that game. 12:40 PM. Could have sworn I started the coffee. 12:45 PM. Milk expired two days ago. You know what? I live in Center City, Philadelphia, and I am going to need to buy more milk, anyway. I half-ass my hair, get shoes on, take the elevator down. 12:55 PM. At the corner store I get milk. Also frozen waffles, because I’m sad to be out of pancake mix and will settle for second best. I see that I’m out of cash. The total is about six dollars and the store won’t take my plastic for less than a seven dollar order. I quickly grab some overpriced junk food cereal, and then, when I remember I don’t have any fresh fruit at my apartment, bananas. Total cost of a trip to the store for “milk”: twelve dollars. 1:05 PM. Empty out the old milk, rinse it, place it along with other recyclables precariously atop the refrigerator. Start drinking the goddamn coffee already. 1:10 PM. Breakfast involves a little bit of everything I bought. Chocolate-and-peanut-butter cereal is mixed with two handfuls of another type of cereal I bought from Trader Joe’s two months ago. 1:25 PM. Educating myself about web memes. 1:40 PM. Computer maintenance, figuring out what I would like to change about my anti-virus and anti-malware software configurations. 2:30 PM. I need to do a bunch of downloading to get my system up to date. Since I’m using my phone’s portable hotspot function for my home Internet (and will pay lots if I go over a certain amount of data each month) I should go get a coffee somewhere and use that place’s stuff. 2:45 PM. Returned a thing to Staples that it turned out I didn’t need. Walking through a beautiful, cloudy December afternoon, I once again notice that I am the only one in just a t-shirt and jeans. 3:00 PM. Coffee shop coffee and quick wi-fi! 3:30 PM. But you know how it goes when you’re updating old software and re-installing new software: things take forever, so you check Facebook and read the New York Times while you’re doing it. 4:00 PM. Copying information from my transcripts into the Occupational Therapy Centralized Application System for this application cycle. This is an ongoing project. While I’m at it, I check my Jefferson email. The form I dropped off has been filed, and I am officially withdrawn from the program. 4:15 PM. Why why why why why. 4:30 PM. I walk home. 4:45 PM. The sun is setting already? But oh, it’s pretty. 5:40 PM. Cooking dinner while changing account passwords and deleting old versions of my Life Story archives. Typing up journal entries. 5:45 PM. Get together dirty laundry. 9:10 PM. Get back from sitting at a coffee shop and uploading/backing up parts of my Life Story. 9:15 PM. Start laundry. 9:35 PM. Do dishes. 9:45 PM. Salma calls, then Allison comes over and I hang out with her until Wednesday. 75 The day I spent with Allison was a day spent figuring out how to get fabric hung up to cover my windows, finally. I’m sure I would have tackled this project with more alacrity if not for the fact that I live on the sixteenth floor. Buying the fabric was more expensive than I anticipated, but the black and white pattern works well, and I’m not someone inclined to worry too much about the look of jagged, scissor-cut fabric edges. In the nighttime we danced around to music and read silently from the Life Story. Occasionally I was reminded that I was sick. The next day, I was eager to get back to tossing into the trash all unneeded traces of my life as a Jefferson student. 76 I need to work on my story about what happened. The narrative I tell in my professional life. 77 Allison and I decide quite randomly to stop in at a Cosi for a coffee. In front of us in line, it turns out, is Rachel, a friend Allison hasn’t seen for a year or so. The three of us sit down, then, for the length of this light lunch. The chatting is pleasant. Rachel, it turns out, lives in the same building I do. She invites us to accompany her that night to a thing she wanted to go to, an open mic someone she knows is associated with, which is purported to include both poetry and music. Allison and I have no particular plans for that day, so after killing a number of hours we make our arranged rendezvous at a subway stop and ride together to the event, which is taking place inside a church. We’re a little bit late and a little bit surprised to have to pay to get in. None of us do anything in front of the small crowd gathered in the church pews there, but we respectfully watch until all the performers have finished. After taking a closer look at the nativity scene outside the church (which somehow included actual barn animals) we went back to the subway. “That was painful,” Rachel says about the event. “Yeah, I was disappointed,” Allison agrees. “We need to start our own literary salon and take over Philly,” I say. “You know what?” says Rachel. “I actually really want to do that. ” The three of us talk about all the things that prevent things like regular writing groups from getting off the ground and being productive. It seems this is something we all seriously would like to make happen. 78 Dec. 23. I stumble around in the dark, getting my things together. I part ways with Allison, stand in line behind a woman with the logo of the band Nine Inch Nails tattooed on her neck, and then I ride the El to where I’ll catch the New York Megabus. Soon I’m in Manhattan, alone with a bunch of time to kill while on my way to Massachusetts. Nice. I spend most of my day walking. 79 I don’t see anyone in Massachusetts until the day Salma returns from New Jersey. That day, Kelsey finds the two of us walking along Main Street in Northampton and invites us over to his place, a basement apartment that Tina previously rented. We have a fun time, drinking some beers and talking about podcasts. A day after that, I pick up Allison at a relative’s house. (Did I mention that she’s from Massachusetts originally? She’s up visiting family for the holidays, too. ) We get a hotel room together that night. I keep planning over the next few days to return home to Philadelphia, but this and that keeps coming up and giving me reason to stay. Finally, on the 31st of December, I take a Greyhound bus south. Allison comes along. We sit on my window sill and watch a panorama of fireworks. 80 On the 1st of January I spend eight hours creating art, just as I planned out in advance. Then I check my Bandcamp account and see that in the past several days I have made hundreds of dollars from the study songs I recorded in 2010, Songs of Anatomy and Physiology. What? Yes. A popular blog called Regretsy, which usually just gawks at bizarre hand-made crafts sold on the web site Etsy, has found my album and decided to post about how weird it is. I spend the next couple of weeks uploading the rest of my albums and in general setting up an online presence for myself as an artist. 81 Jan. 14, 2012. The food here at Little Pete’s is all that I want in diner food. Sadly, as I am a patron on his own, the rules demand that I sit at the counter in close proximity to other people and feel awkward and weird while I write into my little notebook. Allison has seemed annoyed with me, lately, and I don’t know why. I know she wants to date casually, which is probably why I’ve never met anyone from her life except accidentally. Most of the time she treats me like an acquaintance, and I try to be content with this. I love her, actually—in the way I love dozens of people out there I connect with, many of whom I’m not in regular contact with, some of whom I don’t even dare to really talk to anymore. If everybody leaves eventually anyway, why not just buck convention and wish them all well and promise yourself that if they’re ever in need and you can help them, you will help them, because you want them to do well? There are times when I feel like I’m too old for this sort of dating. But when I’m not settled in a life or in a geographic location, how could I date at all except by being sort of casual? (In asking myself these questions, I’m reminded that I think what I want for myself in the long term is rather non-traditional, anyway. I don’t think I want a domestic life that’s limited to one place. I want a love who might, say, run away to Canada while I travel to Korea. And “home” will just be the place we know we’ll go to when our bodies won’t let us adventure anymore. ) 82 Meeting with Alyson early in the morning, across the street from the 30th Street station, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Alyson, whom I’ve known since about the time of her eighteenth birthday, some eleven or so years ago. We board the Megabus. She has warned me that she’s likely to sleep on our way to New York, but before she does that she invites me to a seder she’s planning at her apartment. Since I’m fairly ignorant of religious rituals, I have her explain what I should expect. I also interrupt everything she says with silly jokes. I listen to podcasts on my iPod while the road goes by. We arrive in Manhattan, sort of without me even realizing it. By the time I have woken her up and we have gathered our things together, we’re the last off the bus. That’s fine: we’re planning for a long day, even though we don’t have many specific plans. It’s cold, but not mega-super-ultra-cold outside. We’re fine walking around. We head to the Polish Tea Room for matzo ball soup, then walk through Central Park to the gift shop of the Met, where Alyson replaces a backpack she used to have of the Egyptian hippo that is the museum’s unofficial mascot. We go to Zabar’s to look for some sort of chocolate-covered flower petals that Alyson once bought there. No luck, however: it seems that they don’t carry those anymore. By this point we’re waiting for her friend, an activist named Sarah, to come in from Brooklyn. At a Starbucks we meet up, then we walk to the general area of where the taping of The Colbert Report will be. Sarah is wearing an anti-Verizon pin. I ask her why Verizon in particular is the corporation she’s publicly calling “evil”, but I don’t quite follow the story that she tells. The three of us grab some food at a diner, where the guy waiting on us flirts with Alyson and Sarah while ignoring me. It’s painless getting inside the studio for the filming. We’re not as early as perhaps we should have been, but after standing briefly in an outdoor line we’re led into a somewhat cramped room, where a video of a previous episode is playing. Esther is really cutting things close: she missed the train from Connecticut she had planned on taking, and now her estimated time of arrival is about fifteen minutes before no one else from the outside will be allowed in. But she makes it! All is well! Yay! It’s a fun time. This is the last episode before Colbert holds an unlikely event in South Carolina with the already-out-of-the-Presidential-primary-race Republican Herman Cain. After the taping we go to a nearby bar, where I get to chat with Esther for a while. Esther was always a lot of fun. She says that she would like to buy my spare ticket to see The Book of Mormon on Broadway on April 1, so we’ll get to hang out again within in a few months, at least. She has to leave, so then the remaining three of us take a train to some neighborhood bar in Brooklyn, which is full of Sarah’s activist friends getting together. Alyson and I don’t actually have much time to spend there before we need to leave and walk to the subway… …where we discover that the train we were intending to take is, for unclear reasons, not running tonight. A train conductor tells us to take his train to a certain stop and to then transfer. This gets us into Manhattan, at least, but the next train we’re supposed to take is no longer running… Ugh. Alyson is starting to freak out. We have about fifteen minutes until our bus to Philly is scheduled to leave. Ever the optimist, I sort of sprint ahead up the steps to the surface, stand at the curb, and manage immediately to hail a taxi. Alyson is getting emotional, tearing up, and then is feeling embarrassed about crying. The cab driver speeds in the right direction. We pull in behind our bus—which, according to the person loading luggage into it, is just about to leave. Indeed, after Alyson and I manage to take the only two side-to-side seats remaining, it isn’t two minutes before the bus pulls away and takes us back in the direction of the City of Brotherly Whatever. I sleep through the ride. Alyson stays awake and uses Facebook on her phone. 83 It’s morning and I’m just around the corner from my apartment, sitting at an International House of Pancakes. Allison has been less into me lately, more excited to go on dates with other women. I’ve sort of been feeling down. Much like last year, the first school to get back to me this application cycle was Bay Path College in Longmeadow, Massachusetts. They’ve accepted me again, so that’s my fallback plan. 84 While I’m job hunting I notice an opening at a Planned Parenthood location in Center City. I don’t have the background they’re looking for, but I immediately think of someone—Brianna. When we were getting to know each other she mentioned her passion for reproductive rights and said specifically that she would love to work for that organization. Through the OKCupid site I send her a link to the job listing, then. She thanks me and says that she’ll definitely apply. (I later see through her Facebook that she gets the job. ) 85 I invited someone I was talking to on OKCupid to buy my extra ticket to Aimee Mann. I told her that while I had friends I could invite along, I would prefer to go with someone who could pay for the ticket. We met and I handed her the ticket and she didn’t offer to reimburse me, so I didn’t mention it. Sigh. We had a quick drink after the show, before she had to catch a train home. I didn’t dislike her, but I also didn’t feel our personalities really clicked. I hugged her goodbye because she was nice enough, and as I did that I felt like she seemed ready for and open to a kiss? (Which I didn’t want. ) Dating is one of the few things in life that can consistently leave me feeling surprised. "

    "title": "XIX. Aberrant (86-100)",
    "body": "86 I live now with one of the best apartment views I’ve ever seen. The place itself is an unglamorous but not-tiny studio apartment sixteen floors above three nightclubs I’ve never been to—the gay one, the straight one, and the lesbian one. I walk most everywhere I go. I sit with coffee somewhere pretty much every day, choosing from a dozen or so nearby coffee shops. If I walk west, I walk among the super-ritzy and super-professional—the Rittenhouse crowd. If I walk southeast, I get to be a part of that unique South Street vibe: a strip that’s lined with sex toy shops, rock venues, temporary art galleries, head shops masquerading as convenience stores, plus a Whole Foods and a Johnny Rocket’s. If I walk directly east, I pass the Liberty Bell; and if you’ve never just happened to pass by an iconic thing like the Liberty Bell on a snowy winter’s night while tipsy on a second date, realizing that it’s just you and the woman on your arm and the security guards watching you who are at this moment in the presence of a thing that almost every person in the country would recognize… you’re missing a wonderful and actually rather empowering perspective. I figured that I would stay in this apartment until the end of my lease, then find something cheaper—maybe with roommates, maybe just a different studio in a more affordable part of town. I had crunched all the numbers, and after two full years of living with my mother as an adult in his late twenties, working a third shift job full-time while studying more than full time, volunteering one morning per week at a hospital some seventy miles away, I had paid down my credit cards and built up savings, and I had earned acceptance into a well-regarded program in a health profession whose starting salary exceeded all I had previously hoped for. I wanted to make sure I was content as a full-time graduate student. I wanted getting to class to not be a pain in ass. I wanted to be sure that I had everything I needed to be effectively studious. Also, I wanted to convince myself that I was not forgetting to live life for myself as much as possible. Where did I go wrong? In a department where nearly every professor I met had a smart and sort of dark sense of humor, I had no reason to think that I would be seen as too weird. But it was perhaps the weirdest professor of all who headed up the program I was in, and he graded in such a way as to keep everyone concerned for their academic well-being. I had been getting paychecks for a graduate assistantship. When I withdrew from my program, I still owed several hours of work to account for what I had already been paid. I spent my final weekend as a student, then, laminating diagrams for a Neuroanatomy class. The professor who oversaw this had a glowing, positive energy, which, at the department’s open house event, had helped convince me to attend the program. She said to me, during my last day on campus, “You made a very wise decision by withdrawing now. ” She had graded one of the papers whose indefensibly harsh grading had convinced me the department didn’t want me. I put hours of research, drafting, and revision into a two page paper about Tourette’s Syndrome—a condition I have. I received the equivalent of a ‘D’, and at a meeting in her office I had been given no constructive advice about how to improve my grades on future assignments… an experience I had had with other professors already. What was I to do, then? I could have finished that first semester with ‘C’s on my transcript. After two semesters, a student with below a 3. 0 would be dismissed from the program. All signs pointed to a behind the scenes consensus that I might not be someone who should represent the program’s good name. So, I just had to say to myself, “Fuck that. Fuck their professional opinions. ” Perhaps I was different from the other students, but that in itself was neither good nor bad. I had navigated workplace politics successfully in my own way for years. So I thought about my future, and I decided that I should withdraw from the program and apply to other schools. I just wasn’t willing to stake my professional career on my ability to convince this one department in Philadelphia that I was legit. Since making that decision I’ve been trying to find work to fill the gap in my monthly budget. So far, this has not worked out. There are only so many places hiring for direct care jobs, and when I don’t hear back from them, I start trying for the sort of call center work I used to do. But then my experience in that field is not recent, and I don’t hear back from those jobs, either. And then I start to panic. I’m already in at one of the OT schools to which I’ve applied, so I don’t have to worry about that. What I do need to worry about is what I’m going to do with myself until September. I’m feeling embarrassed. This sucks. In the long term, not much about my potential or ambitions have changed. But for now I’m just staring out this window, staring out this window, wondering how I’ll keep paying for this lifestyle. 87 In addition, my social life since moving back to Philadelphia has been mostly based on casual dating. This is less fun than it sounds. 88 I’m about halfway through a draft of a literary fiction novel about jelly doughnuts. 89 In theory I like to support locally-owned coffee shops, but the places close to my apartment are all relatively crowded. There is a certain Starbucks I go to often because there I can often find seating against the wall. I go today, open my laptop, and get distracted by Twitter. At one point I get up to the use the bathroom, cautiously taking my backpack and even my coat with me. To save my chair I leave my Michael Chabon book on it, but a guy at the next table thinks that I’ve forgotten it. “Sir! Sir!” he yells after me. I stumble into a display of Starbucks-branded gifts. “I know!” I yell back, “I’m just going to the bathroom! Thank you!” When I’m done in the bathroom I go back to my seat, open the computer again, and look for work. Here I am. Here we go. I’ve learned living the hard way, and in some ways, that can actually be the better way, if you survive it without too many bruises. Me, I’ve been lucky, and my bruises are quite small. I’m left with some pretty neat strategies that I can use to deal with the uncertainties in life. For example—one should always have a fallback plan, but that fallback plan must never be boring. Doesn’t this make sense? Don’t plan to fall back onto something comfortable if you fail. Fall back onto something epic. So I began filling out applications for seasonal jobs in faraway places—jobs that hire people from far away. And if I feel skeptical about doing something so drastic as a way too get by, then I should be motivated to get out of my funk and apply to more things locally. Right? Right. The epic fallback. 90 Pensive doesn’t have to mean sad; sad doesn’t have to mean down; down doesn’t have to mean out. 91 Being is the spell. All is retroactive. 92 (Ohhh, I get it… when you say “cheese”, your mouth sort of looks like it’s smiling!) 93 Online sales of Songs of Anatomy and Physiology earn me about eight hundred dollars before they mostly stop. I take the money and spend it all on a fancy piano keyboard. 94 I’ve spent a lot of time with someone since this past weekend. Her name is Rosalyn. Also, I’m flying to San Francisco in the morning. What? Yes. It’s for an interview, for which I was invited on short notice, at an OT program out there in the Bay Area. After that I’m flying to Little Rock, then hanging out for an evening in Nashville, then taking a bus to Louisville and flying to New York for a taping of The Daily Show. For reasons I won’t get into, all of that adventuring won’t be much more expensive than just flying to Cali and back. Then I’ll be back in Philly on Monday night, having been to every U. S. state except Alaska. I’m already accepted at Bay Path College, a school in western Massachusetts. Waitlisted at one here in Philly—my application didn’t get processed before the deadline. I’m waiting to hear from another program here, too, although that’s a doctoral program, which would mean an even more extended commitment. And I’m waiting to hear from a program in Boston, too. My need for a job is a serious matter at this point. It does kind of seem as though my life is always perched upon some unimaginable border between awesome fulfillment and sad failure. 95 I can’t believe I spent as long as I did walking around San Francisco. Much like the last time I was here, I kept hoping to stumble upon that one doorway that would lead to something unexpected and interesting for a wandering stranger. But again I didn’t find anything, really. I’m back at my hotel room, now, sweaty and stinky. This after walking around in jeans, a tee shirt, and a light, unbuttoned overshirt in February. 96 A quick trip around the corner for tomorrow morning’s Vitamin Water reminds me that the romance of drunk people and second-hand marijuana smoke has faded from my mind. Then I go back to my hotel, walk up stairs to the correct floor, swipe my key card and open a door into the wrong room. I DARESAY THIS SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE. I step into, then quickly out from, a room in which the lights are out and a couple are in bed. I say, “Oh, my God,” and then scurry into my correct room before they can step out into the hall to try to figure out what just happened. Well, THAT probably just ruined their night. I’m definitely using my deadlock. 97 Spending a Saturday night in Little Rock after a Friday night in San Francisco was definitely a shift. Stepping out from my hotel onto the sidewalk in SF was overwhelming, even for me. I did the same in downtown Little Rock, tried walking for a few blocks, saw no people and only one (slowly-moving, perhaps curious about me) vehicle pass by. At that point I just went back to my hotel room to sleep. I checked out in the morning, walked across the river to North Little Rock, picked up my tickets at the bus station, walked a little bit farther so that I could pick up some fast food. Then it was back to the bus station to finish reading the second of the two books I brought with me. Helen Oyeyemi’s The Opposite House is a quicker read than I would have thought. I had lunch at the Memphis terminal while the bus was cleaned. Then it was time for a (cramped) ride to Nashville. The young woman who sat next to me offered some of her Arby’s curly fries before she started eating. As a Northerner, the thoughts that I watched came into my mind as she did this were, in order: Thought #1: “Oh! She must have been given an extra order of fries by mistake, and she doesn’t want them. ” Thought #2: “Did she do something to the fries? Maybe something happened to them, and she wants to give the somehow now-disgusting portion of food to a random person on the bus for fun. ” Thought #3: “No, that’s not likely, given that she’s by herself and has no one with whom to share the joy of being an awful person. The odds are low that she’s trying to give me any sort of gross-out fries. ” Thought #4: “Okay, but I’m full and don’t really like those fries, so I’ll just decline the offer and thank her. ” Several hours later, it finally occurred to me that this was an example of the odd and confusing Southern custom known as “courtesy”. Now I’m in the heart of Music City with some food in me. How weirdly stimulating, how much like old times it feels, seeing new places by bus. I’m reminded of a side of my personality that has declined over the years—an attitude I used to step into easily, a role I would play while passing through such dirty heapings of Americana as one finds while rolling along from bus terminal to bus terminal. These days, if I’m unshaven and dressed in worn-out old clothing, I just feel sloppy… but in previous times, that sloppiness could actually add to my confidence, could make me feel somehow more “real”. It was a sort of psychic blending in with the gray, the stench, the plainness. It isn’t a mindset that I miss, because it’s linked to that world and keeps you inside that world. The real Jack Kerouac didn’t age well, and neither do those white men you see, inevitably on the west coast and scattered elsewhere, wearing denim, who look like they would say that they are living exactly the life they want but who are more likely just clinging to a life they remember having wanted years ago. 98 1: Hi, Levi! It’s time for that thing that happens sometimes—an angel interview! 2: Ah. Okay. It’s a pleasure to hear from you. 1: Yeah? I’m glad you think so. How are you doing tonight? 2: Hm. All right, I’d say. Being here in Nashville is great as a memory-maker. I do notice that travel for its own sake has less appeal to me at this point in my life… but what can I say? Years ago, when I first realized that I had been to thirty-five states or something like that, I realized I was setting “see all fifty” as a goal for myself. And I’m uncomfortable with letting my goals rest unpursued for too long. 1: After you hit Kentucky—which will happen in a few hours—you’ll only have Alaska left, eh? 2: Yeah. And it’s interesting… the travel I’ve done in the past year, this included, has been just for the sake of going to new states and seeing what I’ve wanted to see in those states. They’ve not been financially responsible trips for me to take, although I considered the expenses and tried to make sure that my going would not end up ruining my life or anything. 1: You’re focused on a path that will get you to where a little money spent on vacations now won’t mean much in comparison to what you’ll have access to. 2: Yes. This trip I’m on now is a different animal—I used credit from a previously canceled trip to pay for the plane tickets. But when I traveled this past summer, that was part of an agreement I had made with myself. I stopped smoking, and I accepted a low standard of living for a while, and I didn’t really let myself indulge in much for a while. Then, in exchange, I told myself that I would let myself go wild and “vacation”. 1: “Vacation” is in quotes because you didn’t grow up with vacationing as a part of the culture you were in. 2: Right. And I thrust myself further away from that culture every time I, like, go to a place that has a Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville. I have to deal with the guilt that I feel about being wasteful, about being one of those tourists. Even if I’m only being a tourist in my own semi-unique way. 1: You feel like you have to change your “normal”, because your old “normal” was associated with… 2: …powerlessness. Working for minimum wage and lamenting how trapped I felt. Wishing loudly but impotently that I had been one of the lucky ones. 1: And when you yourself have been to, say, Hawaii, you end up no longer yourself feeling the sort of jealousy that you used to feel when you would talk to college students who vacationed to Spain and the Bahamas and wherever else. 2: Right! Their privileges seem less disgusting once I’ve proven that my own privileges have been able to bring me to a similar level of disgustingness. 1: So, you make yourself have more things in common with the upper middle class. 2: Imitation isn’t enough. The price of class mobility is a lot higher than just, y’know, working and studying and whatnot. It really does involve a certain betrayal of what does and does not seem to be in good taste. But anyway, I’m sitting by an open door at this ice cream shop, and on the other side of the door a ceiling appears to be falling, or getting knocked down, or something? I’m not sure what I’m breathing into my lungs right now. So, I’m going to move on with my wanderings. 99 1: How is the Sweetwater IPA? 2: I must have tried this before at some point, right? Well, nothing is disappointing about it. It’s not as elaborate as a Dogfish Head or Ballast Point brew; those are always like little short stories for the tongue. No, but this reminds me of a Lagunitas, maybe, with its up-front bitterness that stays in your mouth from the first sip. 1: So that means it’s… good? 2: Yeah, tasty enough. Weird that I now have two of this drink in front of me. Two for one pricing on Sundays—I guess that’s one of the benefits of stopping in at one of the few places on Broadway in Nashville that doesn’t have live music going. 1: I’m sure tonight wasn’t your last chance in life to hear some random singer do a cover of “Friends in Low Places”. 2: Right? I’ll drink to that! Here, do you want my second beer? 1: Did you do something to it? 2: Ha, ha! Callback to my journal-writing from several hours ago! Clever! Cheers! 1: You’ll never be a beer reviewer, by the way. 2: Yeah, yeah, I know. Whatever. 1: So, hey. Are you comfortable with the person you are? 2: Right now I feel like I am. When it gets hard is when it seems like no one around is seeing me, reinforcing me. 1: But that’s not now. 2: Nah, that’s not now. So I don’t need to talk about it. 1: What have you been thinking about? Having so much time to think. 2: I thought in San Francisco about how my eye was drawn to couples enjoying themselves. Rather than, say, the daringly-dressed singles, the conspicuously artsy people. And I wondered to myself, when I saw gently-walking couples… I felt like I could imagine myself being one of those men. And I wondered why, in my life, I haven’t usually noticed comfortable couples who remind me of what I’m like when I’m part of a couple. 1: So, what you’re saying is that you never came to romance intending to have what anyone else had. 2: The thought that love can fit into society in a straightforward, healthy, and non-tragic way—I guess… hm. I guess the thought that life could be so simple is still something that delights me. 1: It seems pretty simple at this point. Almost everything you see fit to reflect on, these days, comes back to how horrible you have always thought your life would probably end up being. 2: Yeah. I appreciate the good parts of my life; it’s just a long process for me to get used to having those good parts. 1: Well, look at the people you’ve known, conversed with, connected to in the years since. When is the last time you felt out of your league? 2: I know. It used to happen a lot. I feel a lot more competent, these days. 1: You’ve proven yourself capable, and you have qualities—especially your intelligence—that will open a lot of doors for you in the future. 2: Isn’t it great? I’m lucky. I’m really lucky. What’s hard is that I shouldn’t have needed to struggle as I’ve struggled. In theory, I mean. I’m probably going to have to lie about the texture, if not the factual content of my life story, going forward. This written record that I keep will preserve what I’ve been, tried, done, and gone through… but I myself will have to let a lot of it go. I’m increasingly defining myself according to my present and future, rather than my past. And my past is… well, it’s a social liability. 1: Another beer? 2: Nah, I’m cool. Are you getting better at this, by the way? I don’t feel as bossed around in this interview as I sometimes do. And you’re still manipulating me in the way you’re intending to? 1: We don’t call it “manipulating” people. 100 Nashville turns out to be fun, albeit an odd sort of fun. A couple who are from Massachusetts speak to me because one of the bags I’m carrying says “Mohegan Sun” (a casino in Connecticut), which my relatives often go. I try to explain what I’m doing in Nashville, with humorous results. Then I turn my back and watch the band on stage until I decide that it’s time to head to the Greyhound station, write, and wait for my bus to leave. "

    "body": "101 “Life really is longer than I thought it would be,” are the words that run through my mind as I walk along Broad Street in Philadelphia at six in the morning. It’s too early for many of the people in business suits to be out. It’s more the working class who are out, waiting for buses, making conversation in groups of two or three. Back at my apartment, the smaller of my two laptop computers is still open to old chapters from the Life Story. Once in a while—usually as I’m assembling new sections by formatting them, cutting unnecessary paragraphs, clarifying a sentence here and there—I read over those old writings, always doing it quickly, always surprised that after so many iterations of this process there can still be missing periods and unintentional lower-case “I”s. It’s a remarkably effective way to help myself feel grounded again. Life gets prohibitively busy, time and time again, and weeks pass without my trying to get down into words anything that has been happening… but a narrative forgives these omissions. The old events I’ve been reading about happened twelve years ago, and it feels like they were twelve years ago. The prose, though, and many of the observations I made at the time, still feel current to me and in many cases align with how I view myself and the world today. As I walk away from that dramatic view of City Hall (the one pedestrians are always photographing from the median) and head in the direction of a Starbucks that I know is just opening for the day, I find myself amazed to think that I still have for the most part the same energy level, the same mobility, the same endurance that I had when I was nineteen. My mind is just as quick. My body is just as quick. I am still in many respects just about as youthful as I was then. This is not to be taken for granted. I walk into the Starbucks, where stools have not yet been taken down from where they were put up the previous night. The sky is skill dark, for what that’s worth amid the electric light of the city. A couple of other people are in the coffee shop, rushing, standing somewhat more closely to me than I would prefer as they consider pastries and breakfast sandwiches. I’ve been awake all night. I’ve wounded, if not destroyed, my sleep schedule this week. But I feel perfectly fine with that. Yesterday morning, after about two hours of sleep, I rode the El to the Frankfurt station and from there took a bus out to Langhorne. There, upon a large campus filled with staffed houses for developmentally disabled residents, sleepiness prevented me from feeling nervous and left me with only my articulateness and politeness—(these being, strangely but conveniently, two of the last traits to go when I get tired)—as I interviewed for a position similar to what I was doing in Massachusetts before I moved most recently to Pennsylvania. “I’m recommending you for hire,” the interviewer surprised me by saying. We parted ways with him saying that he looked forward to working with me. I don’t yet know the details of the position, however; neither did he. I also am pretty sure that an in-home care agency I interviewed with last week is taking me on pending their reference checks (which they for some reason do by mail) and whatnot. So, I’m not actually one hundred percent certain what I will be doing for work, but I’m pretty sure I will be working soon. And that is a much better feeling than the feeling that I should constantly be job-hunting. Phew. Relief. With an Earl Grey tea in hand I walked back to my apartment. There, I wrote. And then I was like, Oh! The sun is coming up. And that was the signal for me to be tired. 102 I rode the light rail to the Devon stop. I stepped out into the bright, warm day and found Rosalyn, who was waiting for me. I had been getting used to a car-free existence. Now I was visiting the suburbs frequently, and Rosalyn was often picking me up like this, and she was often driving us to this or that destination. It felt as though, when she picked me up, I was stepping into a portal into the other America—the larger, more innocent America, the non-urban America. Rosalyn had taken the day off and spent the morning doing household tasks. Now we could go out for food, go for a long walk, stay up late, and wake up in the morning. She could prepare a breakfast and I could wash the dishes while she showered. Time could pass both quickly and slowly. I could meet a couple of her friends who were up from Maryland, who were going to be crashing at her place—Tom and Claire, who were in town for a contra dancing event combined with celebration of a friend’s birthday party. They walked through the doorway and contended with Rosalyn’s chihuahua Kaylee, who still had not transitioned into seeing Tom as a friend rather than an intruder. The two guests were both wearing green; the moment I noticed this was the moment I finally realized that it was St. Patrick’s Day. Rosalyn has some long-term physical concerns, including joint issues, having to do with the time she was hit by a bus in D. C. , and she didn’t really feel safe to contra dance on this particular weekend. This left the two of us free to wander, and wander we did—off to look for a sitting-with-computers-and-coffee spot that we never found. Still, we did get ice cream, and we did talk and enjoy each other’s company, and we did walk around the town of Phoenixville and feel the not-yet-too-warm March weather. We met up again with her two friends at an apartment building in Jenkintown, where an impressive number of people from the contra dance community (hailing from other metro areas and just visiting for the weekend, in many cases) were sitting around and having the sort of gathering only a bunch of people who had danced for the better part of three hours before heading to a birthday celebration with beer and vegan ratatouille could have. In other words: the people there seemed to be in good spirits and social, but also very ready to be off their feet. This desire to stay in one place was helpful in an apartment as packed as this one was, anyway. Rosalyn—a certified massage therapist as well as a physical therapy assistant (PTA)—worked for a while on Claire’s foot, leg, and knee. I sat by and chatted, pleased by the delicious vegetables in my tummy and enjoying a single bottle of Hop Devil from the crisper in the refrigerator. Eventually, as the night wound down, people began singing dance songs. I eventually realized that these were in many cases not traditional tunes but rather original lyrics being sung and then echoed by the group. It was about an hour long ride back to Rosalyn’s place, guided by the friendly voice of her GPS box. I slept with Rosalyn and Kaylee the Dog on the living room floor, while Tom and Claire had the bed. My sleep was disrupted at several points in the night by the skittish Kaylee, but in the morning, when I woke up to some french-pressed coffee and oatmeal with blueberries and a nifty woman to hug, I couldn’t be grumpy—just disoriented and clumsy and lacking in cognitive ability, as I usually am in my first hours after waking. The Marylanders took off, and Rosalyn drove me to the mall, and I took a bus into Philadelphia, and I picked up my mail, and I went back into my apartment, and I looked around at the pretty-clean space, and then I was back to my usual pacing around, thinking about the details of survival. 103 Two days later I was in Rosalyn’s car again, being driven to her place from the King of Prussia Mall. It was around five in the afternoon, so there was a notable amount of traffic along the various arteries. “You’re too fucking close!” yelled the guy on a motorcycle in front of us, who had a woman behind him on the bike. That was odd. I didn’t think that Rosalyn (a good driver) had been abnormally close to them at any point. As we continued to follow the motorcycle through various stop lights, the guy driving it started waiting as long as possible to pull forward each time. It seemed that he was trying to provoke us into honking at him or something. Finally, after Rosalyn had refused to take the bait on several occasions, the biker got up off his bike and started taunting us further about how our car was supposedly getting too close to his bike. I said nothing and avoided eye contact; Rosalyn said just enough to not be completely ignoring him. “You cunt!” he yelled. “You’ve got too many dollars and not enough sense. ” And that’s how I learned that Rosalyn’s car, a BMW, is apparently the type of car that is seen to indicate a higher than average income. 104 I stayed over that night. We had our usual walk. I played with Kaylee lots and lots. I slept on the left side of the bed, woke up to the sound of a necessarily loud alarm, prepared coffee, shaved my face, and showered. Then I placed myself down next to where she slept, and I told her what time it was, and I engaged her in conversation enough to ensure that she knew she was awake and not in a dream. She had agreed to drive me to a Starbucks in a nearby town before she left for work. While she showered, I took Kaylee for a walk. Then I was riding again in that BMW, holding the GPS box in my lap, hoping that it would find reception. She sat with me for a bit at the Starbucks; I had a bagel and she had oatmeal. It was early morning conversation that we shared before she left to attend to the therapeutic needs of elders. I sat with my laptop, then, and about an hour passed by. I relived times I had documented thoroughly—times that defined my reputation among certain crowds in western Massachusetts, times that were nearly a decade ago, times that in many ways felt embarrassing to me now, although they had been the foundation of the person I now wanted to believe myself to be. The newly-polished shoes I was wearing were one of five pairs that I owned. It was the older, more worn of my two identical pairs of “professional” shoes. The other three pairs of shoes—my black Converse All-Stars (a type of shoe I had purchased for the first time at the age of twenty-nine for their comfort and because in my younger years I had always felt too unhip to wear sneakers in that style), my white and black and inexpensive workout sneakers (which I had purchased in spite of my aesthetic preferences as part of my mission to stop worrying about what I looked like in exercise clothes) and my fifty dollar brown leather low top boots (purchased for the sake of having a casual but non-black choice of footwear, and also just in case Philadelphia saw some snow this winter, which it didn’t) had all been left at my apartment in Center City. At the appropriate time I began walking the mile or so to the small office of the home health agency that had decided to take me on. I listened through my iPod to podcasts. The walk involved no sidewalks. I passed one other pedestrian along the way. The woman at the agency was again very nice. She explained that she and her husband had started up this area branch of the national company, in what sounded like a franchise-type arrangement, a little over a year prior. She also explained that she was the hippie, while her husband was the cowboy, and that she specialized in the staffing and administration while her husband handled the marketing. I was able to finish her thoughts whenever she would start talking about how to provide good care. No problems there. The nature of the business meant that I wasn’t being hired for any particular position but rather that she had a short-term live-in position in mind for me, to begin in a few weeks, and that client needs (plus, I presumed, the quality my performance) would determine what was available. Once again she mentioned that they were amenable to the possibility of their employees working for other agencies simultaneously. I, of course, was still waiting for word from another company about a position at a group home in Langhorne for which I had been told I had been “recommended for hire”. For now, I didn’t mention that. I walked back in the direction whence I had walked before. I listened to various music selections. I had a long bus ride, followed by a long ride on the light rail, ahead of me before I would be returned to the Market East station. The rest of my day was the rest of my day. I spent much of it feeling exhausted from the modest amount of sleep I had received, plus the fairly substantial amount of walking I had done on uneven ground. It felt as though things were coming together—that I again knew what I was trying to do. Things with Rosalyn felt good. I could feel hope, and that hope could calm me, even if I was still too wary to let myself get excited. I was smart and inventive, thoughtful, and with a good heart. When I needed an internal feeling of reassurance I could take a step back and reflect on what that meant objectively. Even if I had been unlucky in some ways, I could step back and see how I was lucky—lucky enough, in the present tense, to be the sort of person one might reasonably suspect could have a good life ahead of him. I happened to take an elevator with Rachel as we each were coming home to the building we both live in. She and I talked about what pieces of writing we might want to share at the following day’s meeting (in my apartment, several floors above hers) of the Misterio Collective. I spent the next day as I have spent many recent Thursdays—cleaning. Once again, this writing group session did not see any of its members sharing any writing or discussing craft at all. Instead, we hung out and chatted and ate some food from my pantry and drank some wine that Rachel had brought. I couldn’t fall asleep, even after the guests had left. I lay in bed watching Netflix on my computer until the morning. 105 After another night at Rosalyn’s I took an Amtrak train to Massachusetts. The reason was that I would soon be needing a car—not just for the sake of transporting me to whatever workplaces I might have between now and August but also for the sake of getting around once I begin the program at Bay Path College. The ugly east coast scenery rolled by. I looked through the train windows at roads crowded with cars, cars, and more cars. I knew that most of the people in those cars loved owning cars, loved driving cars. I knew that they wanted more shopping centers with parking lots and larger plots of land that would separate their homes from those of their neighbors. I knew that millions of Americans thought that by emulating their parents—by following what they believed to be long-standing practices and traditions of society—they had done all that they possibly could have done in life. These people could believe that reward should be a certain thing for them, that God or karma or justice or the fates would give them their due. When they found over time that they were not rewarded as expected, they often decided that they were being repressed by a force they did not understand. They might think that this force was the devil or the government. In fact, the repressive force that kept them from getting ahead was usually their own community and its over-confident certainty in What People Must Do. As I waited to exit the train, the guy standing in front of me asked, “Excuse me, do you do any acting?” I said that I didn’t. “Oh,” he said, “I’m usually right with these things, but sometimes my radar’s off. What do you do?” “I’m an occupational therapy student. ” “Well, that’s not bad. ” (I must have sounded sheepish. ) “No. I like it, at least. ” Then Bruce tried calling, and even after I was unable to hear him, I tried nervously to look busy with my phone. I found Bruce’s vehicle outside. I rode with him from the Springfield Amtrak station to Chicopee. I had misplaced my license, and anyway, I had nowhere to go. Salma wasn’t responding to my messages. So, after some conversation with my mother, I went upstairs. I had the second floor of the house to myself for myself, if you didn’t count my cousin Katie’s gigantic puppy. I slept in the bed that my cousin had been using. In the morning I woke up late—I really must have needed the sleep—and I checked my phone. My mother and Bruce were going to test drive a vehicle for me? And all they had done to see if I would like to come along was to send one text message? Whatever. It took me a while to get myself to move out of the bed. The space I was in was the space that I once knew as my “Intimacy” room—the actual bedroom of the two-“bedroom” apartment I had above my mother’s space, back in the years 2000 and 2001. After my running off to Portland, Oregon for the first time in 2001, the living situations had changed. My aunt Cheryl had lived in the space for a while. Then my mother’s parents, Memé and Pepé, had moved into the downstairs, while my mother and Bruce lived upstairs. Recently—since my most recent move to Philadelphia—my mom and Bruce had moved back downstairs, while Memé moved in with my aunt Brenda. Pepé, of course, had passed away. Though license-less, I drove around in the morning on a quest to get coffee and food. I then ended up, inevitably, in Northampton, where (after some time sitting at the Woodstar) I got in touch with Julian, who was in town briefly with his girlfriend Vivienne. I picked them up and drove them into town. Vivienne had seen a dress she wanted at a store inside Thorne’s Marketplace… …but when we got in there, as Vivienne flipped through the sizes on the rack and Julian pointed out that there was a changing room, a woman who worked at the store stepped forward to say, “The registers will be closing in three minutes. ” Vivienne decided at that moment that she was no longer interested in buying the dress, if the store’s employee was going to rush her into a purchase that way. So we went to the Roost. Sarah X. , whom I had not seen since 2004, was behind the counter. I wasn’t buying anything, although Julian got a juice drink and Vivienne got a bagel. I didn’t actually try to mention to Sarah who I was or let her know that I remembered her. Ah, well. Julian, Vivienne, and I sat around a table and bantered, then. Vivienne: “Mmm, I want the chips and salsa. ” Julian: “Vivienne keeps wishing she could have salsa, but she can’t. ” Me: “Why not?” Julian: “She has to be sure to avoid potassium. ” I allowed the two of them to elaborate on this while secretly, instead of paying attention, I was working over-hard to formulate a pun. Finally, the pun cames out. “That’s ironic: the symbol for potassium is ‘K’, but in Vivienne’s case, potassium is…” Both of them finished the joke along with me: “…not ‘K’. ” They needed to meet up with Morte and the woman who was working with him on a musical project. I dropped them off. After many attempts made over the course of many days to contact Salma, I heard nothing from her. As planned, I woke up early the next morning. Because I had been in school and was only just about to start new employment, I wouldn’t have been able to consider getting a car except that my mother and Bruce were willing to take out the loan and have me give the payments to them. They had been to one auto dealership already, and that place had had a not-too-old, not-too-high-mileage economy vehicle for sale. This was the vehicle they were planning to take to their preferred service place today, to have it looked at. I rode in it as a passenger with Bruce. I didn’t like it. Despite my usual disinterest in cars, I found myself nitpicking about the condition, and I didn’t like how the ride felt. I had Bruce return it while my mother and I tried out some different dealerships. I didn’t find anything that appealed to me until I tried a Volkswagen dealership. Although the dealership photocopied my license and took down its information, they seemed to look the other way about the fact that it had expired in the year 2010. I drove a black 2008 Volkswagen Jetta contentedly and decided that that would be the car I would go for. I was told that I would be able to take the car from the lot two days later—Wednesday morning—but on Tuesday the dealership called and revealed, sketchily, that oops! For complicated reasons, they didn’t actually have the title for the car in their possession, so I would have to wait an uncertain number of additional days before driving it off the lot. Happily, Salma had listened to a voice mail message I had sent, and this had finally alerted her to my presence in the area. We arranged to meet at Food for Thought Books in Amherst for a reading of slam-style poetry that Salma’s co-worker Jane and former housemate Anne were planning to attend. At the scheduled start time of 5:30 Salma and I, along with one of the owner/workers of that collectively-run bookstore, were the only ones present. Even the poet was running late. By 6:00, though, we were moving our chairs into a circle for the reading. After the reading, Salma, Anne, Jane, and I all went to dinner at the new location of the Amherst Brewing Company. Then Salma and I went alone to the Moan and Dove for beer before sitting in her car for a while, talking about everything. "

The idea was not just to save me money on rent but to test out what it would be like for us to live together. After all, we both liked the idea of us moving toward a more serious relationship. If living together short-term worked well, and if our hopes remained the same after I moved to Massachusetts, she would want to relocate to join me for the duration of my schooling. Rosalyn was one to think ahead. That had sort of become my thing, too, so it was comforting to find someone else who brought a reasoned and pragmatic approach to relationship-building. 107 On Wednesday I drove to Enfield and told the Volkswagen dealer there about my situation: paperwork signed for a 2008 Jetta, which the dealer in Northampton didn’t yet have the title for. Unsurprisingly, I was soon being offered a 2009 Jetta with substantially fewer miles on it for the same price. I put down a deposit. Salma called, sounding depressed. I was able to make her laugh by suggesting that we should meet in West Springfield and go to some chain restaurant that we would usually never go to. I painted a funny picture in words about the suburban families we would be seated near. The Ninety-nine Restaurant was actually quite empty, but there was something nice about having new scenery. We ate and talked. She was feeling like a failure, doubting herself, having a hard time throwing herself into any specific plan for the future, although she was pretty sure she would apply to some programs in social work for 2013. After a long hug goodbye outside in the parking lot I took my mother’s Honda Civic back to Chicopee and went upstairs. I chatted with Rosalyn online, then I continued to edit my way through old portions of my Life Story until I fell asleep. 108 Thursday saw me driving to Longmeadow, where I had an unpleasant experience talking to someone at Bay Path College about financial aid. She said that the budget estimates they used to determine what graduate students could borrow only amounted to about half of what a person would really need for room and board. The tone of my response may have bordered on rude. I drove back to Chicopee and mentioned this to my mother, who said, “So you’ll be moving in upstairs, then?” “No!” I responded. It was too soon to accept that as a possibility, even though, short of canceling all my plans to become an occupational therapist, I had no other ideas for what I possibly could do. 109 On Friday morning, March 30, 2012, I drove my new 2009 Volkswagen Jetta from the dealership in Enfield, Connecticut to Rosalyn’s apartment in Spring City, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Then she had to pick up her friend, Emilie from Maryland, who was coming down from New York City for the weekend. We went to Five Guys, then, because it was one of Emilie’s favorite places. After an entertaining but quick stay there, I was dropped off at the train station. 110 The next day I cleaned, then invited Allison over. I tried again to fall asleep early but ultimately only got about an hour and a half of sleep. Then I walked several blocks, grabbed a coffee from one of the nearby Starbucks locations, and walked to the Greyhound station. I waited around, reading, then boarded the bus to New York. If I slept at all during the ride, it was for no longer than twenty minutes. Mostly I listened to podcasts. After some confusion about where I was going geographically, I met up with Esther. Even though she was in the midst of a weekend of leisure she looked stressed out, carrying her large purse, walking towards me. There was no hug hello. “Where should we stop for food?” I asked. “I don’t care. Around here it’s all going to be chain places. It’s like, why do plays have to be here, where it’s all so crowded with tourists? It’s not the real New York. ” “Let’s go in here, then,” I said, as we approached a little place that sold sandwiches and baked desserts and was not a chain at all. She seemed satisfied when she saw the cakes that she could choose from. I ordered a sandwich. After eating, as we walked in to the space where we both would be seeing our first Broadway play, she commented that there were no bad seats in the theatre. She was right; I did not at all regret my choice to purchase less expensive seats, even if doing so had required me to buy the tickets eleven months in advance. And the musical was excellent fun. New York was starting to get to me, too, when I would visit like this. Seeing a famous metropolitan landmark was not usually something I got too excited about, but in my life it had always affected me when I could step, even briefly, into a situation that in my younger years I would never have expected to see in my life. I had felt that way at the age of seventeen when, dressed like a beatnik entirely in black, I walked the boardwalk in Santa Cruz and was suddenly in a world of laid-back surfer dudes and women in bikinis. I had felt it at the age of nineteen when I sat in an apartment overlooking Central Park and a maid served me desserts on what I can only assume was a literal silver platter. I had felt it as I eyed the pearl necklaces of old couples at the Seattle Opera. I had felt it when, as part of my self-incentive to quit smoking, and having lived super-frugally for months, I flew to Hawaii alone—to a large extent secretly—and upon my arrival at my hotel suite stepped out onto a balcony and looked out over Waikiki. None of these situations “should have” come about in the regular course of a life of a high school dropout from a forgotten lower middle class city in New England. They came about in the course of my striving to be myself. Seeing The Book of Mormon in itself was not a big deal—it cost me a day of my life, some planning, and a little over a hundred bucks. But on April 1, 2012, I was also able to imagine myself as the sort of person who could, if I so directed myself, live in New York and be in touch with what was happening culturally. I could imagine myself as someone who had far transcended his roots. After the play, Esther and I went to get coffee. Then we went to dinner. As she poked at her salad and I poked at a plate of chicken, broccoli, and pasta, I asked her whether she had been dating anyone. She hadn’t been… …but once I raised the topic she went with it, and she talked about her ambivalence, her feeling that in some ways she should be a catch, but that in other ways she couldn’t help but worry that she was not simple enough, as well as not attractive enough, to attract men. She was crying when the waitress came around. 111 Day one of the live-in job passed more quickly than I would have expected. I arrived after driving for quite a while on an empty tank of gas (having forgotten, apparently, that when I have a car I need to continually refill the thing with gasoline). The male half of the husband/wife team that owned this branch of the home health agency pulled into a spot in the driveway next to me. I had slightly less than a clue about what this job was going to be like. I had some more details about the habits and characteristics of P. , the man with dementia I would be caring for, laid out for me. Then I was brought inside. The first person I met was the wife of one of P. ’s sons. This young couple, plus a family friend (who had grown up across the street and was also in his twenties) now lived in this house. They had unexpectedly found themselves taking in P. a couple of months prior. “You dodged a bullet,” I was told right off. “This is very unusual, but this morning we found him awake in his room, earlier than usual, with feces everywhere. ” I had been under the impression that another employee would be present for my first day. Nope—just people who lived there. Over the course of the day it became clear that after meeting me the family was scrambling to try to have people they knew around as much as possible during the following week (which was a long-scheduled vacation week for the couple). The family friend who also lived there was, it turned out, going to be around while I stayed there. 112 As the days passed, a couple of things became apparent. First: that for someone like myself—that is, a person with some experience providing direct care—there was nothing exceptional about what was required for me to assist this person. He was like some others I had worked with, in that resistance to things like personal care was the main problem I encountered. Second: He did not always sleep well, and this could be a problem. 113 It was my third night of sleeping on the couch in the living room—only, I wasn’t sleeping. I had fallen asleep at one point, but then P. had appeared, clutching his blanket in a meager attempt to stay warm, wandering into the room in his usual, confused state. I was approaching sleep again. I was fantasizing about some made-up game that might allow me to look at Rosalyn and say “I love you” in her presence, without having her hear it—without me having to think the impulse through. Then I heard sounds and I sat up, startled. Through the darkness, “It’s just me, man. ” It was the roommate/family friend, trying to return home at around two in the morning without disturbing me. Then I was awake for a couple more hours. I switched back and forth between watching reruns of the U. S. Version of The Office and watching whatever was the most boring thing I could find on one of the C-SPAN networks. I was truly out of it when the nurse (a young, newly-graduated RN, for whom P. ’s private care amounted to a fortuitous, foot-in-the-door first nursing job) entered at 9 AM, as planned. With my hair a mess and my gray, collared shirt untucked from my black pants, I tried to explain that I was about to go hop into the bed (to which I had explicitly been allowed access) in the vacationing couple’s room. I furthermore mumbled something about how she should wake me up whenever she thought it would be a good time for us to shower P. At around eleven o’clock, the agency called to check in. I conversed for a few minutes, trying to sound like I had not just been asleep. Then I went back to sleep. I dreamed vague but hurtful dreams about being back in Massachusetts. In the dream, various family members didn’t like me. They were mocking my study of occupational therapy—saying, I think, that I wouldn’t ever manage to have a career in that. I lay still for a time, then, alone in the bed of a couple I had only met once, on their comfortable memory foam mattress. Hanging from the wall, a Google TV (which I had not yet tried to use) served along with various carefully framed photographs as a contrast against the Gilmanesque yellow wallpaper. (Yellow was, in most of the rooms of this ranch-style house, a dominant color. How much of this was intentional and how much was the result of decades of indoor smoking was difficult to determine. ) The thought that I might return to Chicopee was an outcome that could only have resulted from the strangest, least likely combination of circumstances. The possibility was painful to even think of. 114 On one of a few shifts she was being paid to work alongside me, the young nurse who had been taking care of P. for a couple of months worked with me to get him showered. Like the last time, this was a difficult endeavor. “Get off me, you asshole!” he yelled at her, throwing a weak fist into the air, hovering over instead of sitting on the shower chair. She was cleaning his front side. Meanwhile, I was trying to get his back done as much as I could. “You’re an asshole!” she yelled back at him. Her voice, though, sounded non-threatening, being both weak and high-pitched. P. ’s way of insulting her was to sneer and call her a “little girl”, and in fact, she did sound a bit childlike. I wondered if a man like myself could ever find a similar voice—one that could express “I mean business” without sounding scary. This was, I thought, one of those lines a male caregiver needed to walk cautiously. She said to me, “You don’t have to take his shit, you know. If he calls me an asshole, I’ll call him an asshole right back. ” I should have just nodded in agreement, but instead I became philosophical: “I just try to be assertive and help him out quickly. I can’t take his insults personally. ” “Still,” she said, “Even before the dementia, he was an asshole. It’s just his personality. You don’t have to take it. ” 115 I fell asleep around 3:15 AM, then woke up around 5:30 to the sound of the family friend doing something in the kitchen. Peeking at the video monitor, I saw that P. was awake and sitting up on his bed. I walked down the hallway to his room and saw that he had wet the bed. I knew that as a general rule sleepy people were less resistant than wakeful people when you pulled down their wet diapers, told them to stand up, told them to sit down again, and helped them into new diapers, so it was not a huge deal to get him and the bed dry. “First leg up,” I said, lightly guiding his right leg so that he would be prompted to move himself from a sitting to a lying down position, “Then the other leg. ” At about 8:15 something woke me up again and I saw that he was awake and standing in the doorway to his room. He was receptive to my verbal prompting when I said goodnight and told him to sit back down. I got him lying down once more. As much as I wanted to get back to sleep, I had not found a good time to shower during the previous day… so I did that now. Once I had showered I was felt more awake, so I sat down to write. Then I heard sounds from P. ’s room. He was awake again. 116 The next day was Easter. It was more difficult than the previous day. I was supposed to shower P. in the morning, but I never got close to accomplishing this. When the son who did not live in this house came by in the evening to visit, I told him about the troubles I had had. “Yeah, whatever. He’s always horrible about that,” he said. I said, “When I get him ready for bed, I’ll see if I can put a towel under him and wash him with a facecloth. ” He shrugged. “If you think he’ll put up with it, sure. ” 117 After a day of being at best avoided and at worst swung at and threatened by P. (“I’ll throw you out the fucking window!” being a favorite of his threats) I did get him to cheer up a little after I discovered a Johnny Cash concert available to watch on demand. “I know him. What is his name?” he asked me. “Johnny Cash,” I replied. “Yes, Johnny Cash. One of my favorites, if not my favorite. ” He was sometimes able to sing a word or two of lyrics to the songs. It was rare, and nice, to see P. smiling. Then a song he didn’t recognize came on, and he went back to his usual wandering, ornery self: “I’ll be back some year,” he said, shuffling slowly away. 118 After a couple hours of sleep on the couch, with C-SPAN in the background, I woke up to the sound of what, even in sleep, even over the baby monitor, I could recognize as the sounds of P. shuffling about in his bedroom. I changed him and his sheets, contending with his impotent slapping and gripping of my arm. After another hour and a half of sleep, I woke up again. I changed him again. I changed his sheets again. After another hour of sleep, I woke up again. He had his shoes on. While he lashed out at me I got him into pants and changed his shirt. I fed him breakfast, which included his preferred cereal, Honey Nut Cheerios. Once he had finished that I tried to give him his morning medications by placing them inside a snack cake. He ate the cake, but then I saw that he was holding the largest pill, a Colace, between his fingers. I tapped his hand. “That’s your pill from the doctor,” I said. “Pop it in your mouth. Here’s some juice. ” Instead of popping the pill in his mouth, however, he spit out two of the three other pills that had been inside the snack cake, then dropped the chocolate-and-saliva-covered pills inside the cup of apple juice. “There. Put it in your mouth. Get out of my face,” he said. 119 I had called up one of the nurses who worked with P. , and she had suggested that I replace today’s wasted pills with pills from the next day’s pill box. I just wanted to call my employers to make sure this wouldn’t be a technical violation of any medication-handling laws. The woman on the other end of the line said, “I know it can be hard to see, at times, but he’s in there”—meaning P. ’s personality and his potential to be engaged. I saw this as an opportunity to talk about his reaction to seeing Johnny Cash on TV. I believe I managed to sound content and confident. I got the OK to use the next day’s meds. The nurse who was scheduled to come in later in the day would simply replace them from the pill bottles. He ate the pills this time. I pointed outside through the sliding glass window, then, and tried to make small talk. “It’s a little bit cloudy today,” I said. He mocked me: “Oh, a little bit cloudy. What the fuck. ” 120 I went to the bathroom and brushed my hair. P. walked by, saw what I was doing, and mumbled. I said to him, “I’m not sure what you’re saying, but I’ll assume it’s something rude. Here. Do you want to brush your hair, too?” “I’ll do it my own damn self. ” For the past couple of days, the more lucid he was, the less cooperative and the more mean he usually seemed. “That’s what I mean,” I told him. I handed him the hairbrush. “Here. Go ahead. ” Still standing in the hallway, he brushed his hair. In handing the brush back to me, he whapped it as hard as he could back into my palm. “There,” he said, “A present. ” I decided, then, to see if he would brush his teeth, too. He wandered back to his bedroom while I prepared his toothbrush. When I found him, he was sitting down on the bed. “I brought your toothbrush,” I said, trying to physically cue him with a tap of the brush’s handle on his hand. “Oh, that’s good,” he said, pushing the toothbrush away. “Why don’t you, then. ” “Do you want to brush?” I said, trying a casual approach. “I’ll do it myself. You won’t, or any of those other people. ” “That’s what I mean. Can you brush?” Again in his disgusted, mocking voice: “Can you brush. Get out of here. ” “Here’s your brush. ” His hand grazed the toothpaste. He held that hand out, then. “Here. You can get it all over your beautiful face. ” I sighed. “Thank you for the compliment, P. ” I brought the toothbrush into the bathroom. I wet a facecloth to clean the toothpaste from his hand. 121 The roommate here docked his iPod in the living room speakers and left Pandora Internet Radio to play a bunch of Johnny Cash and such. P. was in a great mood for the rest of the night. 122 He pointed to the old picture of his wife on the wall, which was in a frame alongside other photographs from his life. “That there, the woman, she was young. I remember, around that time, and then after, where there are the boys, you see, I remember worse, or better or, you know, it’s something like that. ” 123 One of the nurses who has already come to help on a previous occasion—P. ’s daughter-in-law’s cousin—returned on Tuesday, April 11, which was the next to last day of my assignment. I asked if she thought it would be okay for me to drive to a nearby drug store to pick up a razor, since I had forgotten to bring one and I now more or less had a beard. She said that was fine and that I could take my time. She was going to be at the house until eleven o’clock, and it really only took one person to keep an eye on P. I drove to the nearest drug store and looked in the shaving supplies aisle, but then it occurred to me that I was only about a twenty minute long drive from Rosalyn’s place. I had a key, I knew that she had an extra razor there, and I thought as well that there was a good chance she would be home from work when I got there. I texted her to ask for the okay to go through with my plan. She said that indeed she would be home. So, that was nice. Since I didn’t have the nurse’s number I didn’t want to spend a super-long time away, but I did get a lot of hugs and kisses from both Rosalyn and Kaylee the chihuahua. Once the nurse and I had showered P. and put him to bed—around nine-thirty—I hid myself in the bedroom, lay on that comfortable mattress, and slept. 124 I woke up at two o’clock in the morning and moved to the living room couch. Sleeping in the bed of a couple I didn’t know still felt strange, and I was still worried that P. might get up and wander without my noticing. That had been a good three, maybe three and a half hours of sleep. I managed about another five hours of sleep on the couch, then, until I stirred enough to notice that P. ’s heavy sleep-breathing was no longer coming through the baby monitor. All right, then. I was up for the day. One of the nurses was going to be arriving shortly, anyway. P. was hostile. He managed to land a punch at just the right place on my arm so that it hurt for the rest of the day. I made small talk with the nurse, letting on that I lived in Philadelphia. “What do you do for fun there?” she asked. “Do you have, like, a Buster’s there?” I wasn’t sure what she was referring to by “Buster’s”, but I feared she might be referring to Dave &amp; Buster’s, a chain of restaurant/game/video arcade places that aspired quite openly to be an adult version of Chuck “E” Cheese. I told her that there were many places to do many things in Philadelphia. After I had cleaned up the kitchen a bit and taken a shower, she asked me whether I had left the house at all since arriving. I told her that I had spent some time out the previous afternoon. “Well, if you’d like to get out today, I’ll be here until 2,” she said. That is how I ended up at the Steel City Coffeehouse in Phoenixville, where I could order some fancy macaroni and cheese. With my laptop open I read some newspapers and that sort of thing. I didn’t hang out for too long, though. Since I was getting paid for this day, I felt guilty about hanging around outside of the house. 125 Then my assignment was over! And I stopped at Wegman’s and picked up a greeting card for Rosalyn—all it said was “hello”, because that’s my sense of humor—plus some beer that I could drink in celebration of completing the assignment.

    "body": "126 The next two weeks were destined to be a series of days flowing into each other, never quite giving me the chance to stop and write down anything. While Rosalyn went to work on Thursday morning I returned to Philadelphia, carrying several bags of dirty clothing, plus groceries, plus a pile of my mail into apartment 1606 of the Chancellor Apartments. I had some logistics to figure out regarding how I would be transporting myself to work, where I would be parking, et cetera, and that plus cleaning took up most of my day. The nighttime, then, was taken up by that week’s meeting of the Misterio Collective. I gave myself a couple of hours to find my way to the Woods campus on Friday. This first day of classroom training introduced me to the range of different client types who lived in different areas of the campus. I was pretty lucky, it seemed, to be working with an older, intellectually disabled population that was not usually aggressive or uncooperative. One thing I found odd was the fact that we had to eat in a cafeteria—we rode in a school bus to get there. Once working in the homes we would need to eat the same food as the residents. The food would be delivered to the home each day. Plans regarding my and Rosalyn’s trip to Maryland were changed over the course of the day. Originally Rosalyn’s friend Emilie was going to take a train down from New York and we were going to drive her to West Virginia. That plan had been complicated, however, and so Rosalyn and I were able to hang out in Pennsylvania for the night and put off our plans to drive southward until the morning. I had agreed to this trip mostly because Rosalyn wanted me to meet her mother and because I wasn’t going to have my weekends free for as long as I worked in this position at Woods Services. There was no way to predict how much longer her mother, sick with cancer, was going to be around, so there was a non-negligible chance that this would be the only opportunity I would get to meet her. Where Rosalyn’s planning had begun to make me uncomfortable was the point at which she made plans for us with her sister. “She’s a friend,” Rosalyn insisted, “There’s nothing for you to be worried about. ” Still, I was not unhappy when I realized on Saturday morning that we had overslept and would not be able to detour to Baltimore to meet her. Instead we ended up driving directly to D. C. and meeting up with several mid-Atlantic and Northeastern Morris dance teams who were alternating between outdoor performance locations and local pubs within the nation’s capital. I still was not able to pretend that I would ever wish to participate in any type of Morris dance—I declined even to participate when they did the dance thing that was featured in the movie Titanic (which in the movie had been performed by Gaelic Storm, whose singer/guitarist my cousin Allison married). Still, I had an enjoyable enough time tagging along, seeing some dance, walking through Eastern Market in Capitol Hill, and seeing the National Mall for what was somehow my first time. We met up with Rosalyn’s old friend, Mary, at a Vietnamese restaurant in their hometown of Columbia, Maryland. The conversation between the three of us over dinner seemed to focus on the relationships of people they knew but I didn’t know. Fortunately, I was the sort of person who enjoyed this sort of conversation. Mary, who owned several properties in different states, had an opening in a basement apartment where Rosalyn had lived for several years; she was letting us borrow the keys for the night so that we wouldn’t need to pay for a hotel in the area. As Rosalyn and I relaxed with snacks on the couch in that space, I couldn’t help but prod her to try to find out more about what seemed to me the city of Columbia’s strange sort of pretense. Rosalyn herself, when she talked about where she grew up, seemed impressed by the opportunities this community allowed for. She thought the standard of living and the opportunities for lower-income residents were rare and wonderful things. I, meanwhile, found myself cracking jokes: “The thing about Maryland is, it’s as far south as you can go while still being in Connecticut. ” We picked up her mother in the morning. We went to a Mexican restaurant called Zapata’s, where we ate lunch and dessert. The conversation that occurred was mostly safe, including a long discussion of things Rosalyn had observed during her year abroad in Melbourne, Australia. When we were stuffed full of food and it was time to leave the restaurant it was decided that we should go to Centennial Park, which had been built around an artificial lake. “You two keep walking,” Rosalyn’s mother prompted us after we had walked a short distance, “While I sit for a bit. I need to rest. ” So we did, walking at a lazy pace along curvy, paved walkways on a warm April day, while joggers and families passed by us. “This is my favorite park in Columbia,” Rosalyn said, “Because it’s pretty, and also because of the people it attracts. It’s more athletic a population here. The park is less attractive to teenagers who want to hide away and drink beers or whatever. ” That conversation segued into what Rosalyn, while growing up, thought about the kids who were into smoking and alcohol and illegal drugs. Her mother had in some ways been traumatized by seeing people’s lives destroyed by alcohol. Rosalyn had also always been seriously allergic to tobacco smoke, meaning that even as she grew into an adult she remained, for the most part, separate from any bar crowds, let alone serious drug-using cliques. We dropped off Rosalyn’s mother, who left me with the words, “Take care of my mule. ” Once we were alone and on the road again, I said to Rosalyn, “That sounds like an odd thing for a parent to call a child. ” She shrugged and said, “I’ve always been stubborn, so she and my father would call me their ‘mule’. ” My week of training at work flew by. It always took me at least ninety minutes each way to travel between my place in Philadelphia and Woods Services in Langhorne. Until Thursday night I never got anything close to enough sleep. Some interesting exercises were included in the training—I got to put out a fire (outside) with a fire extinguisher, plus we went through several types of bus evacuation drills—but for the most part I just sat in a classroom and tried not to fall asleep (while everyone else also struggled not to fall asleep). The one night that week I spent out was Tuesday, when Allison said that she was hoping to talk with me. We ended up at Manny B. ’s on South Street—on Tuesdays a nice place for $1. 25 tacos—and eventually she got around to asking questions about me and Rosalyn, and how she (Allison) should feel about meeting her (Rosalyn). The two of us agreed that there was definitely something in general about how we interacted that had always made it hard for us to communicate or to know where the other stood while we were trying to date. After we paid for our food and drinks, we stood for some time in an alleyway, talking loudly and debating whether or not the people in the apartments above us could hear our obnoxious exclamations. After my training was over on Friday I drove to Spring City to pick up Rosalyn. We then had to figure out how to get the pieces of her strawberry shortcake to my place. (In the end I just gave her my keys and told her to bring the stuff up to my apartment while I drove around in circles through the neighborhood. ) Allison wanted pizza. Rosalyn and I were open to that possibility as well. So, pizza it was! But I ordered a smaller pizza than I really should have. But, whatever! Allison and Rachel and Rachel’s girlfriend Ky took their time coming upstairs from Rachel’s apartment, but once they were up everyone seemed to relax and have a good time. For a while I was helping Rosalyn as she put together the (ultimately fantastic) strawberry shortcake, but eventually we were all on the floor, with a new and larger pizza and the shortcake, with me drinking some recently-purchased absinthe and the others (except for the super-alcohol-sensitive Rosalyn) drinking wine. Saturday morning, after Rosalyn and I had woken up, we noticed that the power was out. This meant, of course, that the elevators in my building could not be used. Eh, whatever. We walked down lots of stairs, got ourselves some breakfast at the nearby International House of Pancakes (IHOP), then (after discovering that the power was still out) walked in the direction of Rittenhouse Square, where, after a couple of coordinating phone calls, Honor and her friend from Boston (whom she met while they were at MIT, whom I first met at Honor’s Thanksgiving this past year) joined us. There was plenty of gelato and me attempting to be witty. Honor invited us to come over and watch some Sherlock on DVD, which happened, and which led, then, to Rosalyn and myself walking back to my apartment, only to find that my electricity still was out. Ut-oh. So much for all that grocery shopping I had done the previous weekend. But if we headed up to Rosalyn’s place that night we might still be able to save the strawberry shortcake. We got our things together and took the 10 trolley to the Powelton area where I had lived back in the summer of the year 2007. We got into my Jetta and I drove those boring highways into boring suburban Pennsylvania. Kaylee barked and barked and jumped and span in circles at our arrival. Rosalyn was feeling unwell for various reasons—seasonal allergies, asthma exacerbated by all the stair-climbing we had needed to do to get to my sixteenth floor apartment—and requested that I shower before joining her in bed. She also made the unusual choice to sleep in clothing after she saw that some rashes on her skin were growing. (These would later be treated as reactions to poison ivy. ) Early in the morning on Sunday I had to crawl out of bed and go to my first day of actual work in the new position. The day was impressively dull: about ninety-five percent of the shift was spent sitting around in front of the television. I drove back to Rosalyn’s place. Salma had changed plans and was on her way now, having changed her mind about driving down the previous day. We had decided to have her to drive to Spring City and park there instead of going directly into the city. In addition to probably saving her some behind-the-wheel frustration this would give her a chance to meet Rosalyn. After a meal of the ratatouille Rosalyn had made (as part of a never-ending series of birthday gifts for me?) we got a ride to the train station. It was a surprisingly cold and rainy night… …but when we got back to my apartment, at least there was electricity. I threw out a bunch of things that had been in my refrigerator and freezer. Then I picked up a couple of necessities, plus beer. We hung out and chatted, slept comfortably as friends in my bed, and then it was the morning. She wanted to make omelets from fresh vegetables I bought at the corner store—a project that took a while—but we needed the energy that such a breakfast would give us, it turned out, as we walked and walked and walked around the city. Some research had led me to suggest Tamarind, a place on South Street that would serve up a super-spicy dish of pad thai for her (while serving me a normal version). She found this satisfactory, although she was exhausted by the time we got back to my place. 127 Saturday, I took a scenic ride from work to Rosalyn’s: to the Montgomery Mall and that whole area I had frequented while living with Arden. The Borders Books I always went to in those days was now, like all Borders Books, closed. At Rosalyn’s place, I wrote some good stuff for my novel, I am a Jelly Doughnut—which was, along with cuddling with Kaylee the dog, one of the main activities of my next few days as I had Rosalyn’s apartment to myself. 128 Rosalyn returned from the extended weekend in Ocean City she had spent with a friend. We went to see the movie The Cabin in the Woods. Then she prepared some portobello mushrooms with other stuff, and I made her watch The Devil and Daniel Johnston. Then I tried to ask her provocative questions. I mentioned one way she had characterized herself earlier in the day, as a “shabby genteel” type who had been raised a certain way but no longer was living up to that upbringing’s ideals. We established that in her eyes I aligned with the sort of independent, even bohemian direction she had been pushing her life. She seemed to me, on the other hand, to fit into the more capable, practical-minded direction in which I had been pushing my life. We were sort of meeting each other in the middle, then. 129 Starting a new job was always sure to take over my life to some degree. So it was for the first couple of weeks at Woods. I had been intending to place a listing on Craigslist or whatever for a someone to rent my apartment as a sublet; the idea was that I should stay with Rosalyn until the end of July, then move back to Massachusetts. (Ouch. Move back to Massachusetts. ) But I had never quite gotten around to spiffying up my apartment since my birthday. There were still some things in the freezer that I wasn’t sure whether I should get rid of or not in the wake of that day-long power outage. Additionally, I was really enjoying the feeling of pushing myself to work more or less every day on my novel. Since getting to and from work was a big sort of endeavor, involving my taking the El to West Philly to my car and then doing the forty minute drive from there to work, any work day also felt like a draining sort of travel endeavor. Rosalyn also went away to spend a few days in Ocean City, Maryland with a friend, and during that time I agreed to hang out at her place and watch the dog—a simple task that gave me the opportunity to sit at her kitchen table and write throughout those days. (Why this felt like more of an opportunity than sitting around in my own apartment, I wasn’t sure—but it did. ) 130 Off to the First Unitarian Church with Misterio tonight for a Xiu Xiu concert. Not sure if it will be a let down to have to think of Xiu Xiu as an actual band instead of just a dimension one spirals into. 131 I saw a guy skateboarding in a crosswalk get hit by a car. “Are you okay?” asked the driver. The skateboarder rubbed his legs, stood up slowly from a crouch, collected his skateboard from under the car, and rode away, never saying a word. 132 One benefit to showering in front of an uncovered window on the 16th floor: literally washing yourself in rainbows. 133 Misterio, which Allison and Rachel and I had decided we should try on Monday instead of our usual Thursday—(it really did not fit in with my work/sleep schedule)—was canceled this week by Allison. We tried again the next night, but then Rachel canceled. I spent the rest of the night in my apartment doing very little of anything. Sometimes a change of plans can really throw me off. (An annoying truth this is for one who rarely in his life has predictable plans. ) On Wednesday night I went to Rosalyn’s again, this time fully awake and with my hair newly trimmed. It turned out to be a pleasant little evening, full of conversation as she went through her books and sort of ended up persuading me to take a super whole lot of them. I sighed at moments, then explained my sighs: “It’s another reminder of how I’ll never have time in my life to read all the books I feel like I absolutely must read. ” 134 June 25, 2012. Dipping glazed carrots into baked macaroni and cheese by a fake fireplace while “Voices Carry” plays in this “comfort food” restaurant. “Mac and cheese—fuck yeah!” says the waitress. And indeed, that’s the thought that drew me here when I should have just stayed home and made something cheap. Such are the bourgeois pleasures Center City Philly has to offer. 135 I’m about one more writing day away from what I’ll call a complete first draft of my novel, “I am a Jelly Doughnut”. Four years in the making, off and on. 136 July 11. Word processor autofill that made me laugh too much tonight: “Dostoevsky you have any doughnuts?” 137 I recently spent a few days in a row with Rosalyn, during a heat wave that made sleeping in my sixteenth-floor apartment in Philadelphia without air conditioning feel downright dangerous. (Waking up frequently during the night to drink water and to turn over or replace the latest soaked-through pillow under my head. ) I’m feeling better than I would have expected about going back to the Valley. My one concern is the lack of money I’ll have thanks to Bay Path College’s inexplicable policy of vastly understating the cost of attendance for the purpose of determining what students can borrow. 138 The morning after I put in my two weeks’ notice, I call in. I do this after waking and feeling terrible. Every hot day of this mean Philadelphia summer is quite a bit hotter inside my apartment. My joints crack as I walk to the kitchen and fill a glass with water. The problem I’m facing is partly the heat, yep. But it’s also (and probably mostly) the fact that I’ve only slept for a few hours. (I stay in bed for another ten. ) 139 The Misterio Collective planned to have a meeting at Rachel’s apartment (on the eleventh floor of the same building I live in) on Monday. When Allison found herself in my old neighborhood in West Philadelphia/University City with a flat tire on her bicycle, however, the night turned into an adventure in trying to fit a bicycle into the back seat of my car. Then we got a glass of wine each. The end. 140 July 20. News reports on the radio have been making clear that greater Philadelphia has not been alone in wanting for rain this year. I’m happy to find, then, that there is some drizzle and a cloud cover in the morning as I drive to Langhorne for work. A client of mine is, I discover, in the hospital. Since I established myself a few weeks back as someone who didn’t mind hanging out at the side of a hospital bed for a client (and because this is a client I would normally be responsible for getting up on a Friday morning) I drive to St. Mary Medical Center and find him looking bored while reports air on the television about a shooting in Colorado, at a midnight showing of the latest Batman movie. Cardboard boxes from Rosalyn’s work are in my trunk. I’m planning to try to carry some of them to my apartment today. I’m going to use them to pack up my things. 141 After my second-to-last day of work, on a day when the temperature was in the mid nineties, I took the closest free, non-time-limited parking spot I could find within proximity of South Street and met Honor for Thai food. Being a serious walkophile, I walked the several miles home, then showered and cleaned my apartment a little. I had packed up most of the things I was planning to take with me for Massachusetts for the next month. The sun had gone down, reducing the temperature somewhat, so I decided that I should take some of those possessions to my car and drive to a parking spot a little bit closer to my apartment. Carrying a bag of clothing, a smaller bag of shoes, and a guitar, I took the subway to a bus stop, waited for a half hour, then took the bus to where I remembered parking my car. Walking around in circles for a while, sweating through my shirt in the persistent humidity, I realized that I wasn’t really sure where I had parked. And I wasn’t finding my car. Eventually, for lack of a better option, I called for a cab. After twenty minutes, one came by. “Are you the cab I called for?” The driver shrugged. Looking at a map on my phone, I tried to lead the driver down all the streets I thought I might have parked on. With no success. So, I had him drive me back to my apartment. And I woke up at 4 AM in order to take public transit to my last day of work in the suburbs. I was insanely tired the following afternoon when I met Honor, who was meeting with her French language Meetup at a sandwich place. I followed her through a torrential downpour to her car. (Yes, after all those other mishaps, I found myself getting soaked by rain in the middle of a drought. ) Finally I spotted my car, said goodbye to Honor, drove to my neighborhood, and went to my apartment. I slept for fourteen and a half hours. The next day I cleaned some more, moved my bags to my vehicle, filled up on gas, and made good time driving north to Massachusetts. "

    "body": "1 Aug. 23, 2007. Some lucky birds outside the window of this service station on the Pennsylvania Turnpike have found french fries. Some unlucky birds, meanwhile, are a part of my lunch. 2 Farther west in PA. Near-ish to Pittsburgh. I get a coffee, pretzel, and flavored water and sit down at a table at the rest stop. I’m reading Still Life with Woodpecker. The woman I bought the pretzel from sits down next to me. Our prior exchange had gone like this: I pay her. She drops the change, picks it up, drops it again. “Ohh… I didn’t realize I gave you the jumping change!” In my head: God, I’m turning into one of those adults who make lame jokes to cashiers. “Just wait ‘til you see what I hand you back!” she says. “If it’s jumping bills, I’ll be very disappointed. ” She hands me a receipt. I’m not expecting a receipt. She thinks that I’ve grabbed it but I haven’t. “Oh! Well, it’s a jumping receipt. There you go. ” So, now she sits down. “How’s your trip?” “It’s okay. ” This woman’s, I dunno, somewhere in her thirties. Then an older woman sits down next to her and says, “If we’re sitting down and flirting with the good-lucking guy, I’m joining in!” Compliments my eyes. Asks what I’m reading. It’s not long before they get back to work. I return to the car, then. Funny. When she sat down, my first thought was that it was something bad—like I was going to be accused of a crime or something. 3 8:20 PM. Central Ohio. Lyric called earlier, in case I was in Massachusetts, to invite me to a group outing celebrating August birthdays. We ended our conversation so that she could call and invite Salma. 4 Milan, Michigan. I think Arden really liked me. Okay, I came to that conclusion before tonight. We’re still texting. She’s just as sweet. After cleaning her apartment, she said, the only things I left behind were some hair ties and her. Now I’m typing it into my laptop in my underwear in a hotel room. She, too, was just passing through Pennsylvania. I need to plant roots. I didn’t visit Alice before I left. She’s posting to LiveJournal that she’s having a hard time. With Arden I found that I was able to go to sleep whenever I wanted. She relaxed me that much. 5 On day one I drove from north of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to south of Ann Arbor, Michigan. On day two I drove across both of Michigan’s peninsulae. Now I’m in a place called Ironwood, just before the border to Wisconsin, not far from Minnesota. I’m about as far north as Montreal and about as far west as St. Louis. “Are you excited yet?” Arden kept asking me before I left. I kept answering her that I wasn’t, not really, that I just wanted so badly to be doing something. I just wanted a life. I wanted a sense of where I was, to know where I was living, to know what my short-term and long-term goals were… to inhabit. Getting to work on that would be a relief. I wanted that relief so badly. If somebody offered me an all-expense-paid adventure around the world I would have needed to decline it because that could only make the feeling worse: as I floated in an air balloon above Asia I would be wishing that I could stay somewhere, anywhere that would have me. (Usually we would be in her bed when we had these conversations. Under the covers. Maybe Secret the cat would be there, because Secret was always there. ) Now you can guess what I’m feeling after some twenty-two hours of driving alone over the past two days. (The mountains that trail from the Appalachian range into Pennsylvania—those tunnels on the turnpike. Across the bridge, the seagulls and islands and the mitten waving me goodbye. Ottawa National Forest. What was it, fifty miles in the dark? High beams. I see the next vehicle approaching from the opposite direction like a mile in advance. Look, there’s a deer. Better watch that speed. No cell phone reception. My MP3 player has died and I’m listening to vintage radio dramas until it goes to static. I’m taking the adventurous, scenic route, not taking the freeway but driving straight through these towns and even when I still was on I-75 I went in the wrong direction from an off-ramp in trying to reach food and I could see where I was going on the map so I kept driving, the roads off what I was driving all unpaved and the locals. Eleven miles that way and take a left at the Burger King, that’ll take you back. ) I’m feeling homesick. I barely stopped as I passed through Ohio and I did drive through Ann Arbor because Brianna from Smith once told me that I would like it. (But if I lived in that area now, I would likely keep thinking about Detroit… the same way when I’m around Philadelphia, or anywhere in Maryland, I keep thinking about the condition of certain neighborhoods there. ) Yes, I’m feeling homesick. When you’re highly unsure about where has been home to you, homesickness can lead the way. As it happens, I’m homesick for Arden’s apartment. She said, “This has been different than with other people I’ve… interacted with,” having me hang around her place while she was at work, really just the two of us not getting sick of each other. I would say, “I think it’s awesome that you don’t mind that I keep kissing you so much. ” “I think you do it in your sleep, even,” she would tell me. “I don’t think you know you’re doing it, you just kiss me. ” Her laid-back attitude allowed me to relax, I guess. There with her, I could decide that I wanted to fall asleep and I would fall asleep. Never mind how much caffeine I’d have had, how many cigarettes I’d have smoked or whatever. She has been following my trip on her computer at home. I text message her. She tells me, it’s X number of miles until this or that town… this stretch of road is supposed to be scenic. When I left Pennsylvania, it was from her house. She said, “Goodbye,” and it seemed to me that I had never heard anyone say, “Goodbye,” to me before. Not really. And I said, “Goodbye,” right back. Now I’ve done my soul-searching. I’ve looked at all the options in life, options I’m so fortunate to have. I’m clever enough and determined enough that although I’m confused—although I look at life from many angles, and although I keep a thin skin and open mind, almost as a matter of principle—I’m not going to be a miserable wreck of a human being. Most of us who have open minds and open hearts get fucked up. I’m so lucky that I have other options. Driving across America, listening to radio talk show hosts who don’t seem to believe what they’re saying. It’s all part of the game. Rooting for the home team, that’s all. Working for a salary. I’m moving to the Seattle area, where I’ll be learning machine stenography. I decided against going for a Master’s; I decided against staying and just hoping for some temp gig to turn permanent. But I wish she were here with me. I’m taking the scenic route, which is aggravating, requiring more attention to drive, more dangerous, with more that could go wrong, a path from A to B most people wouldn’t choose to take. “My aunt said that she had a premonition that something bad was going to happen to me,” I said, “But my thing is, I try to turn it around. People are always superstitious about things that they think will be bad luck. So I just try to believe that bad omens are actually good omens. Friday the 13th is a lucky day. A black cat crossing my path is a good thing. ” 6 I’m in a little restaurant area at the Holiday Inn in Minot, North Dakota. Driving yesterday seemed simple. The day passed quickly. The sun in the late afternoon, its beams showing the clouds along the highway, was pretty. I was in my hotel room last night, pacing around, talking with Arden. She sounds like she really misses me. She also seems to think that we’re very different, that it was surprising how I would spend days at her place and she wouldn’t want me to leave. No word yet on the apartment in Kent. It looks like I’ll be arriving tomorrow night without a place to live. I expected that, though. My clothes are in the dryer. Checkout is at noon. It’s about eleven. I should email the woman from the program at Green River Community College, now that I have a student ID number. I think she’s supposed to do something or other to speed up the process of my signing up for classes. It’s drizzly here at the moment. They’re not the huge, nasty raindrops that fall on you in Philadelphia; they’re little dashes of water, cool, tickling, with nothing to prove. 7 Just after I’ve checked out (although I’m still waiting for my laundry to dry) Zella notifies me that we got the place and that she’s picking up the keys tomorrow. 8 Today, Arden sent me pictures of various objects from around the warehouse made into the shape of hearts. 9 As it turned out, Zella wasn’t able to get the keys on Friday. I woke up around 9 in the morning, Mountain Time, in Cut Bank, Montana. I drove west. I passed Glacier National Park, then proceeded through Idaho, then into Washington. Passing the Columbia River on I-90 was a gorgeous thing. At that moment, I finally began to feel excited. The sun set behind mountains. The horizon, along with a large portion of the visible sky, kept changing colors. Now it’s blue. Now it’s purple. Now it’s kind of teal. I found it amazing. Finally, I drove into Seattle. This was also a pretty drive. I found Zella’s current apartment. We walked to a bar, drank a couple of beers, and talked. She seemed very excited about this new arrangement, was squealing and stuff. When it came time to sleep, I passed right the fuck out. 10 Kent, Washington. We went through the process of my getting the funds out of my bank account and into a money order, did the paperwork. At the request of the woman in the office we went to the Social Security office (conveniently located just down the street) to get certification that my social security number is indeed my social security number. Back to Zella’s apartment, her neighbors were about to help her out with packing, so I drove my car and my stuff to the new place. I unloaded a bit, then figured that it would be a good idea to do some groceries and grab amenities. 11 I end up at a discount supermarket, where the prices are so low that at first I wander nervously through the aisles, intimidated by how affordable everything is. I wonder whether there’s some kind of trick to it, if it’s like a wholesale club where you need a membership card or, or, I don’t know… but eventually I get over this fear (which really made me feel like a character out of a commercial, somebody with an absurd reaction to low, low prices) and I get around to buying things. Then I go home. We pretty much have no furniture. I guess this is really for both of us like starting over, building from the ground up. Right now I’m in the living room, where it’s just me, my laptop, plus my two acoustic guitars and my Scrabble board—things I plopped in here sort of just so it wouldn’t be empty. I’m waiting for Zella to come back. I’m hungry. I started cooking spaghetti (in the pot I bought at the grocery store) but then realized I didn’t have a fork, let alone a strainer. I would order a pizza, but I don’t know the address. 12 Everything feels good so far. We went to the Goodwill and got a chair—which is comfortable—and glasses, silverware, that sort of thing. I also picked up a bunch of books. 13 Sep. 1, 2007. I wake up, go to the Panera Bread nearby and get directions to Green River Community College (and to the nearest Target). After a short, early shift at work, Zella comes down and showers and then is getting ready to leave to record a hip-hop track with somebody she knows producing. When I get to GRCC, I’m surprised. I can’t see the buildings at all from the parking lot. It looks like I’m in a state park or something—the campus is surrounded by woods. Quite nice. A security guy gives me a map. We make small talk. He says there are snakes on campus and they all have names. I go back to Panera Bread, search job listings for awhile. Bookmark a bunch of them. 14 Sep. 6. I’m not entirely sure how the time has passed or what I’ve been doing, although I’m happy. I’ve gone shopping a number of times, picking up miscellaneous things for the apartment. Tuesday was a long day of the cable guy setting up TV and Internet, then my struggling for hours to get the router working properly. Since then the wireless connection has only sometimes been working, though. This has left me still going out to Panera Bread to sift through job listings. 15 Zella tells me that the next time I have trouble connecting to the Internet I should just go into her room, unplug the modem and then plug it back then. She does this and I can connect to the web again. She goes to Seattle for something or other and while away texts to ask if someone from her work can stay here for a while, he’s a cool dude and will help with rent. I say that I would prefer to discuss this with her later, in person. Immediately I am filled with dread over what might happen. I’m writing out a request for transcripts from Holyoke Community College and I’m so distracted, so afraid that this living situation will turn sour that I keep writing down the wrong numbers, crossing them out and then writing the correct numbers. Meanwhile, the clothes I put into the washer must be finished by now. It’s time to walk to the laundry room with $1. 25 in quarters and to put these clothes into the dryer. Then she comes back home, before the clothes are even finished drying. I’m in the living room near the sliding door to the balcony and she sits there with me and we each have a cigarette. She’s talking about how she needs to go grocery shopping, which leads to her talking about how much she likes to eat ribs and I’m saying, “Well, you could go somewhere and get ribs now” and soon we’re on our way to the Applebee’s in Auburn. I have a margarita and a bacon cheeseburger. She has a chocolate martini and ribs. I ask her about the guy she wants to have stay with us. He’s living with a couple that fights a lot, would like somewhere to stay until he moves at the end of the month. Yeah, I say, especially considering I’ve never met the guy, I wouldn’t be comfortable with that. 16 From what I hear, we’ll have a couch tonight. That’s good! I’m just relaxing for a bit today. Relaxation! At a little chocolate and espresso place. The past week I haven’t explored much. Staying within a five mile radius, making little trips to the grocery store, cooking. Now that there’s cable I flip through the channels, but it always ends up on C-SPAN eventually. Not because I’m especially interested in politics but because there are no commercials, and it usually just takes a few seconds of some annoying commercial for a sinus medication before I change channels, and whatever I start watching then will eventually break to commercial and then I’ll change the channel again and eventually it’ll be C-SPAN. (Although, there’s still a novelty to watching Canadian television—we get CBC out of Vancouver—so I’ll leave that on sometimes as well. ) 17 By myself at 2:30 in the morning drinking wine and watching the Jude Law Alfie. I’m not sure that I would enjoy this movie otherwise. Marie called me today to tell me that she’s pregnant. As she told me the anecdote of her taking a pregnancy test during a pee break during their “movie night”, I interrupted to ask what movie they had been watching. This was the movie she named, so when I saw it in the channel guide I decided to watch it. Also tonight, I made plans with someone I met on the Internet. For Tuesday, to go with her to a tattoo parlor. I figure I should meet as many people as possible now that I’m in an area where the only person I know is my roommate. Meanwhile, I miss Arden. Oh, thoughts of her don’t overwhelm me or anything… but when I’m by myself at 2:30 in the morning drinking wine and watching the Jude Law Alfie, having my laptop in my lap, this is what I type. I see during a commercial break that Dr. Phil endorses match. com. I don’t. I’m happy and optimistic. I made the right decision, but still… I wish that Arden were here. 18 I’m spending most of my time sitting in the apartment and trying to find people I want to talk with online. This is somewhat pathetic, but temporary. The gal I’m meeting up with on Tuesday is named Beth. She’s about my age, with a son. I think today marks the end of my initial surge of online personal ad activity. I went to an organizing meeting for supporters of Barack Obama. I sat and listened to people talk. It was okay. I learned a bit about the caucus system. I’ll try to remember to keep an eye on upcoming events through the campaign website. I was in a nervous mood throughout the whole thing; I didn’t talk to anyone. I applied to a bunch of jobs over the weekend. Fingers crossed. I know it usually takes a few weeks. These are always difficult times, as it feels like a guilty pleasure to do anything other than search for jobs (even when the best I could do would be to scrape at obscure corners of the Internet hoping for the unlikely event that I might stumble across a job I am suited for). Arden is still being sweet, sending me a picture of her bed: “I saved a spot for you. ” 19 I always used to sort of roll my eyes when I would see a scene in a movie or whatever about someone trying to order a cup of coffee and being confused and bewildered by the choices they’re given. It just happened to me, though. Seattle 1, me 0. Thinking myself hip to the Seattle slang, I specifically asked for a “drip coffee”, only to be told that what they offer is actually a more sophisticated way of brewing that uses a vacuum technology and is like a French press but faster and more customizable. I’m here to watch an open mic, to see if maybe it’s a place I would like to play. I guess this is pretty nice. Being here alone is not the ideal scenario, though. 20 Meeting up with Beth at a restaurant in Auburn. She’s never been here before, but a former co-worker of hers waits on us. Our conversation is laid back and goes smoothly enough. I follow her car to the Supermall, which I decide is an awesome place because although it’s over-the-top and called the Supermall, it really doesn’t seem very “super” at all. I lead us into the arcade, where we each play one game of Skee-Ball and one of a DDR clone. We walk around through a store, which has a lot of necklaces made from stones and that sort of thing. We part ways, then I spend another long night on the Internet. It’s day by the time I sleep. I wake up to a call from the Starbucks call center, but the call gets immediately disconnected, somehow. After sleeping a bit longer I get a voice mail. I call back and leave a voice mail for the person who called. Before falling asleep I had applied to an AT&amp;T call center. The online application process told me to call to answer some question over the phone, so I did. I was set up for an in-person appointment for Tuesday. While I was at it I called the number I had been given when I spoke to someone about a job at AAA. I answered pre-recorded questions. Yup, it’s all call center jobs that I’m going for. Also in my planner is a hiring event for technical support at Nintendo. These jobs mostly pay twelve-something an hour. Pretty good. I went and took my placement tests at GRCC. That went quickly. Then I was out of there, off to try and find my way back home. 21 The days just keep passing! I haven’t been doing much. It’s now Friday, September 14, six in the morning and I’m at Denny’s. Yesterday I stupidly lay down for a “quick nap” before I was going to “leave for my job interview”. That didn’t work out, of course. I slept through most of the day. After I was reasonably awake, Zella was calling from a parking lot somewhere between her work and our apartment. Her tire had blown out. She asked whether I had a jack. I replied that I did not… but maybe I could find somewhere to go and buy one for her, then bring it? She ended up sitting in the parking lot, mistaking her hubcap for lugnuts? Eventually the local Sheriff pulled into the parking lot? And she got his attention? (She was looking sharp that day. Wearing her glasses, which she doesn’t usually do. Unsurprisingly dressed in all black. ) So the Sheriff changed her tire. Zella (who has been working every day to get the overtime pay) related this story to me while I was also chatting with a new stranger online (who seemed to like me, though she’s a bit far away—this is Tonya, from Olympia) and then I was also responding to a text message from Beth in Auburn (which said that the new Hairspray movie was good) and I said to Zella, laughing at all this simultaneous use of tech: “Wow, this is so twenty-first century. ” "

    "body": "112 “If it’s any consolation, you won’t remember any of this in the morning,” I remember V. saying to me. That was after the party had pretty much ended, as my head was in the toilet. It was just me, V. , her husband, and the other couple living in a house with them in Portland, Oregon. Before that, I had easily found the house, walked in, set my six-pack of beer down, and eaten a strawberry… …and there had been V. I wasn’t nervous to see her again, but I was nervous because I hadn’t but on a few occasions interacted with anyone socially for the past few months. Throughout the night I found myself easily in conversation with folks, which was a relief. I was surprised by how many people were claiming to recognize me. One guy remembered me from Bakersfield: “Yeah, you were from Massachusetts, right?” Craziness. It had been more than eight years since I had been to Bakersfield. That all seemed like ancient history, even though I had and could still read so many thoughts, emails, etc. from those days. While trying to take a picture of me, V. said, “Why won’t you smile!” and I replied, “I never look good in pictures when I’m smiling. Have you ever seen a good photo of me smiling?” “Yes!” she said, “I have lots of them. Do you want to see?” “Yes!” “Okay!” And she sprinted off. I was sitting in the living room, then, under a large illustration that someone had done of V. and her husband. It was them and a tree… them sort of interacting around a tree, from what I recall. I think I had seen it before, probably posted to the Internet. When she returned with the photo album, I was ecstatic. There we were. “We were so young!” I said, and considering how important V. had been to my younger self, this is exactly the sort of thing I would expect to say to her in the year 2008, with me being twenty-seven and she twenty-six, with the two of us only peripherally having been in touch for most of these years… …but it’s funny how, although I ended up saying those words, I didn’t say them dismissively, as one adult to another putting perspective on the past. No, in this case the words were an exclamation. It was somehow shocking in the moment to see us and all the others in those photographs—Tara, Mischa, Alex, Alie, Leah, Kelly, and so on—for the kids we had been back in those days. We all looked beautiful to me, in a way I couldn’t and wouldn’t seek to reclaim, in a way I could only appreciate because I was there once, in the past, existing, that boy with the bleached hair from the other coast of America. Those were the friends whose ups and downs had once seemed important to me although now, now… “Whatever happened to…” I asked about various faces. V. responded to the best of her knowledge. The stories she told just went in one ear and out the other, though, because I knew by now that their stories didn’t really matter to me. Whatever impact we all were to have on each other’s lives had pretty well passed. Linking the Bakersfield, California of 1998 and 1999 to my current existence in King County, Washington in 2008 did feel really satisfying, though. I asked a guy the meaning of life. He said something about it being a choice between being stuck on a wheel that keeps on turning or detaching yourself and going out into the unexplored regions of outer space. “Can I do both?” I asked cutely. He replied that I could. “Oh, good,” I said. Then the living room was full of people singing “The Birthday Song” to two of the party guests (not including me, although my birthday had recently passed). Out on the front porch, which was the cigarette smoking zone, I was talking with a couple of gals who aspired to write. Neat! It seemed that I never anymore got to talk with people who shared that interest. And then it was Levi Vomit Time. The next morning (or early afternoon, I should say) was accordingly Levi Recovery Time. After I was feeling better I left the house, first shaking hands with all the inhabitants. I was embarrassed, felt a bit like a mutant from outer space, and was detached enough from V. that I had not dwelt on, and was not going to dwell on, either the strange sort of coda which our holding each other’s hair during sessions of vomiting had become (she had done it for me on my first ever night of consuming alcohol and I had done it for her on that night of hot tubbing) or on that strange “I’m not going to hug you, Vomit Boy” look she gave to me as we shook hands goodbye. Coffee Time still smelled like Coffee Time. I bid Portland, Oregon farewell, made my way up Interstate 5 back to Kent, Washington, and immediately entered the familiar mindset of preparing to move to somewhere else far away. 113 Although I awoke with a phlegm issue still in full effect I could quickly tell that in contrast to the past four days, today I would be able to perform tasks such as walking, sitting, and using the microwave oven without much effort. Heck, I felt like I might even be able to carry things, or sprint, or smile. This was a good thing, too, since it was the beginning of the last “weekend” (Sunday and Monday, for me) I would have before packing up and hitting the highway. I looked around at my bedroom. It was fucking disgusting. Oh, well. Two days! I could get around to that. I ran absolutely fascinating errands for myself, such as: donating to the nearest thrift shop various clothes which had lost buttons or ripped at the crotch and which despite my sewing kit being handy I didn’t feel like turning into guinea pigs for my not especially admirable needle-and-threading skills; returning for cash a hard drive case which, in the mistaken belief that I had brought to the Pacific coast old internal hard disks containing long-lost relics from my previous lives, I had recently purchased; noticing while wandering the Best Buy from which I had purchased the aforementioned hard drive case that Portishead finally had released an album of new material (WTF, nobody told me? Beth Gibbons, you never call, you never write, you’ve never met me or had any way of knowing that I exist, and now this?) and purchasing the album, which I then found to be an enjoyable listen; buying coffee; trying with limited success to get Burger King to make me what is like a cheeseburger, except with one of their veggieburger patties in place of the meat patty (NO MAYONNAISE NO MAYONNAISE); etc. Then I cleaned my car somewhat, did the dishes somewhat, cleaned up the kitchen somewhat, took out the recyclables somewhat, cleaned my room somewhat… somewhat. I finished transferring old MP3s to my computer, a task I had started working on about a year prior. During the preceding and largely bed-ridden days of really-bad-cold-symptomness I had stumbled upon information that the Nine Inch Nails web site was teasing what would likely be a digital release of a new album. I finished the old-MP3-transferring process just in time to join the throngs of bored and/or obsessed people who I’m sure must have been across the globe hitting “refresh” every whatever number of seconds in anticipation. I downloaded the album, which it turned out was being given away free of charge. Because a free album is less enticing than one to which a dollar value has been assigned, I then dicked around on the Internet for a bit longer, looking at other music things, wondering who the hell else might have a new album out. Noticing (while scratching at some bug bite or leg pimple or something) that my positioning seated on the floor for an extended period of time had left marks all over my leg—(Was that from my shoes, or my pants, or my foot, or the rug? I forgot how I had been sitting)—I decided to get out of the house, put the MP3s on my not-an-iPod-because-I-hate-iTunes player, and set out for a drive. Then of course, after getting to the car, I had to go back inside because I had forgotten to bring the car stereo’s face plate. Then I was off. The free Nine Inch Nails album, called The Slip, was pretty good. At various points in driving around listening to the thing I voiced my approval to the windshield in front of me. (The windshield remained neutral on the topic of the album’s quality. ) I drove back home. Then I remembered that I was out of smokes and started the car again. Fetus-like, the convenience store clerk was ensconced by the rolling shelves in which cigarette packs were aligned. She sat with her feet up on the permanent shelving beneath it, reading a book. “Hi,” I said. “Hi, can I get you something?” “Yes, I would like cigarettes. Uhh… do you have any specials?” “Menthol?” “Well, what do you have?” She pointed with her stocking foot at some Camel No. 9 Menthols—Buy 1, Get 1 Free. “Okay, I’ll have one of those. ” She explained that she liked hiding in the spot where she was sitting; it was comfortable, and drunk men stumbling from bars past the outside of the store might not be drawn in by the sight of a woman in her twenties behind the counter. That seemed nice, I said; when I was a third shift convenience store clerk, all I had was a stool. She said something about doing the best with what you have. She took my money, gave me the coins of my change but left the bills and cigarettes on her side of the counter. She stared into space for a moment, then asked me for identification. After checking my I. D. she slid the bills and the butts to me and said something like, “I guess that was pointless,” since she had already rung up the transaction: “You could have just taken the cigarettes and run, I guess. ” I reminded her that she still had had my change. “Oh, yeah. Um, that’s what I was thinking. ” I walked out, then, remembering all those nights in convenience stores far away—how unique and vulnerable, thriving and flawed all those customers had looked under those stark lights. And it had worked both ways, that light: you could see the customers, their reddened skin, the caking of their make-up, while they could see all the wrinkles in your shirt and the bags under your eyes. Meanwhile, each of us beneath our dress, on any given night, in any given convenience store, beckoned to another’s hope. We, these unintentional beacons, signified stories never told in any history. Such stories were only visible under that pale, disgusting, casual, undocumented light. I went home, cleared off my mattress, and went to sleep. 114 Seattle, Washington. My final day on the job passed. I didn’t tell my co-workers that I was leaving. I had mixed feelings throughout the day, although thankfully there was not a lot of fear or regret mixed in there. I continued to feel generally inspired, going so far as to walk to my car during my lunch break to scribble song lyrics onto an envelope. (I didn’t really mind the feeling that there were not enough hours in the day; this was better than boredom, certainly, and it was probably also better than a dispassionate contentment would have been. ) Preferring to have as my last before-I-move pedestrian experience in Seattle not just the same old walk to my car from work, I drove myself again to Victrola on Capitol Hill, had a coffee, and wrote there for a bit. I was the last person to get the hint as the employees went through the motions of closing for the night. Back in my parking lot in Kent, I realized that I was almost out of cigarettes. I went back to that convenience store. Working there was the same gal who had been there the other night. Ringing me up, she started a minor conversation with me: “You took a long time deciding on that beer. Are you sure you found the one you want?” “No, actually,” I said, “I don’t usually drink any of the kinds that are here in single cans…” blah blah blah mumble mumble. I poorly tried to explain that I felt like having a beer, but that since I would be moving out of state the next day I didn’t want to buy a whole six-pack and then have to transport the rest of the bottles or whatever. “Where are you moving?” “Pennsylvania. ” “Wow, that is a trip. ” She said that she was from New York, originally—(I then mentioned that I was from Massachusetts)—but that her mother had moved her here, well, to Oregon originally, and then after awhile had moved her again. “Ah, I see,” I say, “So she moved you all around. Just to… (the next customer was at the counter, then) just to be sure that you were disoriented. ” “Yeah,” she said. I waved and walked away. “Have a good move,” she added. “Thanks,” I said. "

    "body": "22 I feel well this morning. The print copies of volumes one through three of the current draft of my Life Story arrived today/yesterday. I’ve read most of the way through the first one. Now I’m putting off going in the shower to get ready for that open house at Nintendo. I don’t actually need to be there when it starts—it’s an all-day thing in which you can just go and interview—but the sooner the better, since I’ve been sleeping during the daylight hours. It’s worth noting that because of Nintendo Power magazine (which, for many years, I had every issue of) I knew fully well as a child that Nintendo of America was based in Redmond, Washington. It would have thrilled me to no end to imagine going there someday, let alone working there. 23 For so long now trying and trying and thinking and thinking, wanting to get to the point where I can have a full-time job that will pay the bills. I need dental work. I don’t know, I might get this thing at Nintendo, and that would help for now. The customer service center seemed cool. I was interviewed by a guy who tried so hard to be fun and laid-back that it made me nervous. Then I took two tests on a computer—one in which I listened and took notes on what information was given by make-believe pre-recorded calls, then answered questions, and another, which was a typing test. I did well on both. (I tested at 94 words per minute. ) Then I sat in someone’s cubicle to listen in on the call he was doing, which involved him helping a kid configure his router so that it would work with the Wii. There were of course posters and whatnot of Nintendo characters all around, and the aisles were named like streets after them (“Donkey Kong Way”, that sort of thing). There are two big problems with what otherwise I think would be a great job. First, it would be a temporary position for who knows how long. Second, I would need to be available to work any day Monday through Friday between 7 AM and 7 PM—which would basically prevent me from taking either the day or evening section of the first semester Machine Stenography class. Even though I would only need at a minimum to be free for 5:30-7:30 PM on Monday and Wednesday, this has seemed like it might be a problem for a number of the jobs I’ve been applying to or thinking of applying to. So, yeah. I’ve mostly been doing nothing and spending all of my time alone. Weekends are the worst because there’s less progress to be made in job hunting and setting up school. 24 I spent this morning texting with Arden and making lots of plans for exciting things that I would do by myself. Then I didn’t do any of the things that I was planning to do. I slept until about midnight. Now it’s raining. From what I hear, I should get used to that. 25 This morning, I clean. I spray air freshener throughout the apartment, light candles and put on Radiohead’s Kid A. You know—to set the mood. “Everything in Its Right Place”. I keep my laptop out, so that I can write about everything as I do it. I do the dishes. I squeeze out the sponge and wipe the inside of the sink. I wipe down the counters in the kitchen. I wipe down the stove. The candles are still burning. Next, I go to my room. Hm. There’s a lot to be done here. I throw some things in the trash, but more goes with the recyclables. Here all sorts of stuff gets recycled. By comparison, as far as I could tell, the city of Philadelphia had never heard of recycling. Outside there is light but not-quite-invisible rain. I tackle the fridge. I decide to let go of that head of lettuce. The bread still looks good, expiration date be damned. Hungry, I feel a bit light-headed, so I eat a pear. Ohhh, pear. Munch, munch. Type, type. I plug in my computer. I should definitely get one of those, whatsits, surge protectors. I don’t seem to have brought one. What’s on TV? Hm, it’s The Land Before Time. “The circle of life is simple, but profound,” says the mommy dinosaur. She begins singing. Meanwhile, Thom Yorke is singing about… okay, I have no idea what he’s singing about. I turn down the volume on my computer. I plug in my cell phone. I wonder if anybody’s called or texted me since the battery died last night… nope! I finish eating that delicious, juicy pear. And so on, and so on until the place is clean. 26 The Wayward Coffeehouse, Greenwood, Seattle, Washington. I’m here to check out another open mic. I like the space; it still feels new, reminding me of Capo’s (when it still existed) back in Easthampton, Massachusetts. I enjoy laid-back open mics like this. When I walked in, a man was singing and playing a mandolin. After that was a poet. Now there’s a trumpeter. I already think that I should come back next week with something to do. It is an older crowd (and a very small one) and no one seems in an especially good mood, but whatever. I’ve missed going to places like this. The poet (who is maybe also the host?) read again. Now the mandolin guy is up again. I wish I had someone to take here with me. 27 A successful job interview for a job in Issaquah. Among many other questions I was asked: “What do you want out of life?” “I want to enjoy it in a way that I’m not going to regret. ” “How much money do you need to be happy?” “Enough to pay my bills and to give me a reasonable chance of being healthy in the future. ” “What is your best quality?” “Determination. ” “Your worst quality?” “I can be awkward. Well… (long pause) Yes. I can be awkward. ” The pieces of my evil plan to take over the world are all falling into place. And by “evil plan to take over the world” I mean, of course, an ethical plan to survive… but I can feel just as guilty over it, sometimes. It can feel evil to want to survive. 28 On my first day of training I ask, “So do we handle mostly calls from hospitals, that sort of thing?” “No, actually. We have a lot of commercial accounts, a lot of (etc. , etc. )… people calling because they’re trapped in elevators. ” “Wait. We get calls from people trapped in elevators? I thought that only happened in sitcoms. ” “No, it happens a lot. ” He advises me on how to handle such calls. 29 I continued to train at work today. Toward the end of my shift I was taken aside with the other new hire so that drug tests could be administered. Although donating a spit sample perhaps sounds like it should be less awkward than donating a urine sample, in practice this is not the case. I’m handed the little thing, which looks like a cross between a home pregnancy test and a baby spoon. I try spitting into the little cup in it, while three people are watching. “Ah. Yeah,” I say, looking at the red color of what I’ve spat, “I just had some Hot Tamales from the vending machine. ” So I go the restroom and gargle some, try to rinse the candy out of my mouth. I drink some water while I’m at it. The other new hire is drinking water, too. “Okay, and now you have to wait five minutes. ” We fill five minutes talking about how training is going. Then I spit into the thing again, as the other new hire does in hers again. Then the tests get set down on the counter. Minutes go by as the spit settles itself. We have to try a couple more times. We get introduced to several important people in the company while we’re waiting for our spit to settle. “No, this isn’t working,” we’re told, so it’s suggested that we try spitting into a cup. Then it can be, you know, like, spooned into the test. The other new hire and I are spitting into cups for a while. Hers finally gets filled. “Oh, good! Yours is all set already,” I’m told. “What! I’ve been sitting here, spitting into a cup for no reason?” That’s really all there is to that story. No moral or anything—just spit. 30 Overall, as awkward a person as I am, I feel like I’ve been carrying myself pretty well at this place thus far… except for yesterday, when one of my co-workers asked, “Who was training you yesterday?” “Uhh… yeah, I don’t know. I’m really terrible with names. ” “Was she Black?” “Hmm… no?” “Curly hair?” “No, I really don’t remember. ” (Someone else says the name of the woman it had been. ) “Oh, it was her? (She turns back to me) She’s Black. I’m Black, too!” “I know…” I mumble. Sometimes I just sort of… forget to remember people, I guess. 31 Yesterday was pretty much my first day of just straight-up working, not training any longer. The job’s pretty sweet (by my standards, which are of course desperately low). If I don’t know what I’m doing with a call I just put it on hold and make whiney noises until one of the other five people in the room makes eye contact with me and will allow me to spew questions at them in an exasperated voice. I also began my night class, typing on a steno machine for the first time. Tonight it was just me and two women, who, when I tried to “me too” my way into their back-and-forth trying to figure out problems with the software we were using (while it was just the three of us in the room) proceeded to ignore me. It’s interesting to note that all of my peers are now women—all (er, both of) my classmates, everyone I work with (not counting the call center manager) and my roommate. I want to get an in-state driver’s license soon. Everyone keeps going, “Wow, Massachusetts, huh?” I had to explain to one convenience store clerk where it was. (“You know Boston? Boston’s in Massachusetts. ”) Another told me that she just moved here six months ago from Ohio. “It’s much better here,” she said. 32 It seems that I’m getting carded constantly: paying with a credit card at the supermarket (for some Liquid Plumber and impulse buys of Vitamin Water and frozen pizza) I’m asked for I. D. “Wow, Massachusetts! I’m from Philly. ” “Oh yeah? I was just there over the summer. ” “Yeah, I kind of don’t miss it. ” Something about the weather. 33 “If all else fails, drive towards the Space Needle,” Tonya says to me on the phone. I’ve been fairly lost in Seattle for the past twenty minutes or so, discussing some of the sights while trying to find my way. “Seattle can be pretty kitschy,” I’ve observed. The Space Needle is kind of the pinnacle of that. It’s not in sight, though. I haven’t even noticed the thing since I moved to Washington. “Oh, wait, I’m right at the base,” I suddenly notice, reading the signage above the entrance. I look up to confirm. Yup—Space Needle. I park the car, forget to grab a sweater. The weather goes back and forth between light rain and not-quite-rain. No big surprise there. It’s a tad chilly, but I’ll be fine. My first time meeting her, we’re going through the sculpture garden. She has from somewhere or other grabbed a map with descriptions of each of the installations. We look at it all, but by the end I’m saying, “Yeah, the water still wins,” looking out over the Puget Sound. At an overhang, from which you can see the fountain whose waters by design occasionally and dramatically surround either one or the other of the father and son who have been sculpted there with their arms reaching out for each other in eternal longing, I point farther and say, “That’s my art installation over there. I didn’t actually build or design any of it, so the story is in the negative space of what I didn’t construct…” Then we walk. When I first found myself lost today, I was driving on instinct and my instinct seemed to be leading me to the Victoria ferries. Walking now, Tonya and I come to the closed-for-the-day ticket window that advertises two-day trips to British Columbia. I take mental notes of the information. Tonya has a worse memory for the information I’ve told her about myself than I have for the information she’s told me about herself. When I ask her what she’s insecure about in general, she talks about “this”, meeting people and feeling like she can’t be entertaining enough. She asks me what I miss about the east coast. I say that, well, there are people I miss. She says that that’s a given, she means aside from that. “There’s a sort of… enthused insanity that I miss sometimes,” I say. I go on to try to explain Northampton, which is “not where I grew up but where for years I hung out all the time,” but it feels like I’m making it all up, so far away. We get coffee (espresso drinks) and she gets baklava, at a little place we’ve stumbled upon there in Belltown. The guy behind the counter asks for my opinion of the latte. Another guy working there is making conversation. It’s a new place, they have that “we just opened” excitement and there aren’t many people coming in. The two of us sit and chat and as we leave I hit a not-too-great-sounding low E on the upright piano. Then it’s time for drinks. Tonya also gets some kind of pork sandwich and I get some fries. The waitress is a charmer—and I’m usually immune to the charms of waitstaff. Ah, sitting down with cocktails in the city with a stranger. We walk to her car and she drives to me to the parking garage, back next to the Space Needle. She had fun. Don’t be a stranger! Yeah, same goes for you! 34 Now it’s 2:30 in the morning. I still can’t sleep. Finally I take a beer out of the fridge. I’ve been lying in front of the television waiting to be able to sleep. I think to myself that if I can just manage to keep this job, I’ll be able to have a doctor. And a doctor could suggest something to help insomnia, right? 35 I chat with V. and she tells me about her married life. She says I’ve been more adept at carrying out a life plan that she has. 36 “We have a new chair!” Zella observed when she got home. I had picked it up at the nearby thrift store. It was there with the rented steno machine set up in front of it. I had my laptop out; I was sitting on the living room floor with it and was chatting online with Tonya, making plans for her to give me a tour of Olympia on Sunday. Zella and I ended up having beers and discussing civilization, advertising, philosophy. It was good. “This is so by far the best living situation I’ve had,” she said before retiring to her room. 37 Scribbled in a notebook at night when I’m awake with insomnia: Time passes quickly when you’re working the same job each day, all day. Will I feel like I’m just a drone, before long? No, because I can always keep working towards something new. I ask myself, what will I do to make the world a better place? I kind of roll my eyes at myself when I re-read that several days later. “Make the world a better place?” In other words, what will I do to make myself believe, deep down, that I am some sort of superhero? (Once or twice, I dyed my hair to black. My hair is naturally dark already, so this made only a subtle difference. The dye was a blue-black, the person at the salon explained to me then. I was like, yes, yes, let’s do that. Blue-black Superman hair. And for a time in 2002-2003, during and after the peak of my feeling like a local LiveJournal celebrity, my icon showed this hair, and me wearing a shiny blue shirt. The icon was cropped from a photograph of myself sandwiched between Charlie and Tina. We were, each of us, about 19 years old, dressed to be social. That was at Necrology, the all-ages Goth night, when it was being held at the Peking Garden, a Chinese restaurant that existed at the time in the town of Hadley. ) (Talking to me the other night, Zella mentioning the brief period of time during which she and Tina had been best friends. “I had forgotten about that!” but then the memories are there in my mind. Tina was living on East Street in Northampton with some girls she didn’t know. Zella loaned Tina some money and was never paid back. I guess Tina also never returned an expensive dress she had borrowed. Anyway, when the two of them were friends I remember hanging out with them in Tina’s apartment. We watched a tape of music videos by The Cure. It was morning and we went outside to the apartment balcony and smoked clove cigarettes. At that age, having an outside balcony like that and being able to sit and gossip with friends on it… on a nice autumn-or-spring day… and knowing that this wasn’t the space of any parental figures… it was a privilege that we didn’t need to remind ourselves to appreciate. I suppose I can understand why as we get older, it’s not uncommon to look back on 18-22 as a special age range, to say aloud, “Damn, I wish that I were there again. ” A new freedom is a magic freedom. ) I will make the world a better place by being liberated, the sleepless me writes. But shouldn’t the real concern of that “me” be that I’ll be leaving for work in three hours? 38 Saturday night, I’ve spent my work day trying to arrange cleaning services for a feces-smeared restroom, help for a woman who was locked inside of a building, medical advice for people with scary symptoms. I’ve passed along messages about dying relatives for servicepersons aboard Navy ships. Talked to a young man whose father had just died. I’m not exhausted at the end of it all—a fact I take to mean that I’m getting somewhat used to the job. I examine my mental records of what I might do tonight. I could wander alone to Seattle and visit Noc Noc, a goth club that I haven’t been to before. Okay. I park far away, walk to the place, then sit at the bar and drink. I watch the movies playing on the TV behind the bar, read the captions to the ending of Grindhouse and then some Japanese movie about cyborgs. I hit the dance floor for a few songs. I go outside for a smoke and end up talking with a couple of guys from Alaska, who seem pretty negative. Comparing different U. S. cities seems like a safe and pleasant topic, but then it gets turned into, “Alaska girls hide. You don’t get, like, that girl,” nodding bar-guy-like in the direction of someone nearby. The talk wanders through, “I never got comments about my weight until I moved here,” and how it’s safe to walk through dark alleyways in Anchorage but not here. Then, pretty much out of nowhere, addressing me, “Don’t worry. Unlike us, you should have no problem picking up girls. ” His friend concurs: “You should have no problem whatsoever. ” I find when I leave that the parking garage is closed. Parking garages close? I never realized that. I use the intercom to call security, and someone lets me out. I’m told they’ll mail me a bill, but they don’t know how much it will be for. 39 Late in the morning I wake up, get ready, and drive to Olympia to meet Tonya. We rendezvous down next to the water, but it’s raining a bit much. We get into her car and go to the farmer’s market, where a band is playing polka or something and there are many vegetables for sale I have never heard of. We then get coffee somewhere, then wander on foot after the rain has let up. She buys incense at one store. We poke at novelty items inside another store. We hang out in another coffee shop. We get pizza by the slice in an ’80s-themed place. The pizza isn’t great, but in the Pacific Northwest I take what I can get. The two of us walk and talk near some docked boats, consider going to a movie but don’t, then go to her place. We drink wine, sitting around and talking. She feeds me delicious homemade soup. I lie down on the couch while she’s sitting on the floor. I hug her, try to arrange a cuddle, but she ends up kissing me. So then we’re making out for a while. We’re getting tired, though—especially I am. “I’ll have to kick you out at some point,” she’s saying. Aw. But then she says, “Of course, it’s not that you wouldn’t be welcome to stay here if you wanted. I just figured, with you having to work in the morning…” So I’m like, yeah, actually, I’d like that, if I could stay here, and is there an alarm that you could set to wake me up at 3:45? “3:45? God. ” When I see that she’s dragging out something for me to sleep on, though, I change my mind and decide that I’d rather go back home after all. "

No, people can never really be had, so they can never really be missing. We come and go, pass on and transform. Our relationships are arrangements—reactions to our needs and to our feelings for others. The only voids we need to fill are those within ourselves. So I plotted and schemed to become an adult who has never been mentored—one who has needed to try and fail, write and revise, study and research, and figure out himself through trial and error. 41 TO: Arden Last night (Tuesday night), although I could tell that there was something off with where the adapter plugged in, I managed to charge the phone somewhat. This was while I was driving around, listening to the new Radiohead album I had just downloaded, steering myself awkwardly through a dark night along a lonely state highway, past deer, through forest, while the road twisted and angled like a racetrack and while occasionally, briefly, a cloud overhead would shower on me. Driving a ridiculously indirect route towards Mount Rainier, I eventually (just after passing through the last town before the boundaries of the national park) decided to turn around. I hadn’t filled up on gas, and because of the route I was taking I had driven farther than expected. Anyway, that was the last time I charged the phone. I hadn’t been able to find my wall adapter, and I had errands to run, so as I was texting you today (Wednesday) I figured that I would be able to recharge in the car and continue the conversation. But it wouldn’t charge! And now I’m in my bedroom, playing with change that’s lying around on the floor. I’ve actually been having second thoughts about the schooling that I’m doing. I’m reminded of how annoying it is to feel that I’m jumping through hoops, meeting and missing arbitrary deadlines for, let’s be honest here, rather dumb assignments. I had doubts, before, about whether I would be able to find steady, full-time employment wherever I went; that was part of my motivation for wanting to go back to school for something, anything. I figured that if I needed to temp or to work part-time jobs, then I would still be able to slide by on loans while on the way to a better situation. But now that I actually have a steady job and can (with some frugalness) get by on what I’m paid, I think of the other things that I would rather be doing with my free time—writing, for example, or contemplating my loneliness. (I think that qualifies as a hobby. ) There need to be some things that I do for the simple reason that I love to do them… This is the sort of babble that’s been happening inside my mind tonight. Of course, meanwhile, I think of you. I never expected to hear some of the things that you’ve been saying, about missing me and all that. It gets to me. You probably know that, but I’m not sure. I guess what I want to say is, from the time I met you I was telling myself that you wouldn’t want to be with me. This has been important because I do want love and partnership—a lot—and you’re one of the rare people I’ve felt I would want to have that with. But if you didn’t want that, you didn’t want that, y’know? And I could respect that. So, this may be annoying of me to ask you to clarify… but I’m wondering what your intentions are with me, so to speak. I don’t mean to be weird about it, but it’s not clear how I should take some of what I’ve been hearing from you. Thanks, Levi 42 I go to the cell phone place. Digging into my pocket, I say, “I have my phone here. It seems to have passed on. ” The guy behind the counter hums a funeral dirge. Another guy takes over to look up my account information. “Let’s see. It looks like you’ll have to pay for a new phone. ” “Yeah,” I say, “I’m looking for something inexpensive. ” “Well, what we have here, the phones begin at around a hundred fifty. ” I blink. He says, “If you’re looking for something cheaper, you might try Craigslist or Ebay. ” I blink again. He says, “Of course, I don’t know how safe or reliable it would be to get phones there. You could also try maybe going to Wal-Mart. ” I blink again. “Or Fred Meyer, something like that. ” At the electronics department of Fred Meyer, the guy behind the counter is saying to his co-worker, “I’m done. I’m finished with this shit. ” He slumps over the counter. I approach. “Hi!” I say, “If I bought one of those pre-paid phones, would I be able to use it for the provider I have now, and not use it as a pre-paid?” “You’ll want to ask him,” he says, nodding vaguely in the direction of his co-worker, “He’s the cell phone expert. ” “Ah, okay. ” “Yeah,” he re-iterates to himself, looking amused, “He’s the expert. ” I ask this other guy the same question. “No, these phones don’t work on that network,” he says, “But, uh, I might be able to help you out. I have some used ones that would do the trick. Within the, say, fifty dollar range I could get you a camera phone…” I blink. So, yeah, I kind of have no idea when or how I’ll be replacing my phone. 43 Well, I’m early to work—twenty minutes early, it turns out. Classes have not been going well. One thing I seem to have forgotten is that online courses in a way can be more difficult to fit into a schedule, since assignments can be given out at any time and then be due within two days. At least in a regular course you’ll know (for example) that you’ll probably have assignments due every Monday and Wednesday; in an online course you have to check your email daily and then squeeze the work into your schedule as it comes. I sort of hate that. If we were given the assignments and their due dates in advance, that would be a different story. Not to mention that you’re counting on the instructor to be clear about when things are due. It may be, even more than all that, though, that I’ve taken on too much for myself right now. I showed up for Steno class an hour late on Monday and didn’t realize until I had been there for a bit that I had forgotten when it started. Wednesday I just completely forgot that I had class, because I didn’t work that day and it was the first time class was held on a day when I didn’t work… 44 Holy shit, work is crazy today. I’m on my lunch break now. It was dead until a point, and then, well… there was no mistaking that it was another Saturday. If it were like this everyday, I don’t know if I could handle it. Constantly being on three lines at once… yow. 45 Continuing the saga of my attempting to replace a suddenly out of commission cell phone, I walk into a Radio Shack. “How are you today?” “Pretty well…” “Good, good!” “…is there a certain section for phones, or are they just scattered, or…” “Well, what type of phones? We have cell phones, or if you’re looking for a home phone…” “Oh, I’m looking at cell phones. ” “Well, here we have [provider] phones, this here is [provider], all along here is for [provider] and [provider]. ” “Okay. I’m looking for [provider]. ” “We don’t carry those anymore. ” “Ah. Okay, fair enough. Thanks for the help. ” I shrug and begin to turn away. “So you already have a contract?” “Oh… yeah, I’m all set, I have the service, I’m just looking to replace the phone itself. ” “So I take it, then, that you’re happy with the plan you have?” “Uh…” I still am trying to leave. “Well, let me put it this way. How much do you currently pay per month for your service?” “Well, I, uh… I’m all set. ” “The reason I ask is…” I give up the politeness game and walk away towards the door, leaving him mid-sentence. From afar, then, he adds, “Thanks for stopping by! It’s a nice day out there. Enjoy the sunny weather while it lasts!” “Yeah, it’s pretty nice. I will. Thanks. ” 46 I get a warning at work for having been late “five times” Today I’m thirteen minutes late. “One of those times you were only five minutes late, but still,” says Molly, the supervisor who has taken me aside. I ask, “How early can I punch in, if I’m supposed to be at my desk and ready when the scheduled shift starts?” “That’s a good question,” she says, “Hey, Mikey!” calling to the operations manager, “How early can they punch in?” He thinks for a second, then asks, “Well, what’s an acceptable late?” “I don’t know. ” “Five minutes? Sure, that sounds right. ” To Molly, then, I say in a cute voice, “Then it should only be four lates!” She laughs. “Still, Levi. That’s still four. I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt. I thought you didn’t have a car, until someone said that you park on the other side of the building. ” Six tardies equals probation status. Eight equals termination. Within six months. This job may not work out, after all. This life may not work out, after all. 47 I go to my steno class. We have a test. We’re further along in the book-and-tape than I thought we were. After the end of class I talk with the instructor to ask some questions and to explain that I am indeed still in the class and plan to improve. I go home, find Zella in her room, and have another random and awesome conversation. This time we talk about love and loneliness. 48 In the morning, having woken up at 3:45, I get to work early. Then I wait. On days when I start work at 5:00 I need to be let in by whoever is the other person starting that early. Well, this morning either that person is late or I’ve been thoughtlessly scheduled alone for this hour even though I don’t have keys. I consider myself on the clock, therefore, as I sit in my car and write. Yeah, I’m a little miffed. I mean, to hold a five minute tardiness against me? I’ve been working hard, steadily improving despite inadequate training. I really wanted this job to last. 49 Julie is the first of my co-workers to show up. This is not the Julie who was my fellow trainee when I first started—that Julie quit. This Julie used to work here and just recently came back. I get out of my car and say, “It’s been really slow this morning. ” She tries opening the door and finds that it’s locked. “See?” I say, “That’s why it’s been so slow. ” “You’re much more pleasant right now than I would been if I had been waiting out here for an hour,” she says. It’s not long before Talisha shows up. She has the keys. “I was on time today,” I say to her, “But the lock on the door was late. ” I’ll be getting paid for that hour, at least. 50 Inside Tonya’s friend’s house in Tukwila. There are two of them there, two friends. Christine is curled up under a blanket on the couch and wearing a bandana while Trina, who actually lives here, is playing a game on the computer. A quick ride in Tonya’s car, parking at the garage. Meet with Jeff, another season ticket holder, who didn’t feel like dressing up this time. A quick walk for coffee beverages. Tonya drinks hers just as quickly as I drink mine. The opera happens—Gluck’s Iphigenia in Tauris, done in collaboration with New York’s Metropolitan Opera. It’s a good time. Opera is awesome, I decide. This was a matinée, so once we’re out it’s a good time for us to grab dinner. Jeff parts ways with us, saying that he’s ready to go to sleep. (He’s sick with a cold of some sort. ) To a place called the 5 Spot. The menu tells you where all the food is from, like, specialties from all around the United States. Looking at the descriptions, I can’t visualize anything except the All Day Breakfast, so I get that. It’s quite good, including possibly the best bacon I’ve ever had. We’re drinking some white wine, meanwhile, and I’m doing the random question thing. What’s the history of her love life like? Paltry, she says—she keeps coming back to that word. Years of unrequited infatuation with a friend. And before that? Never tried to date, really. Then we’re at a bar. The Red Sox are playing Cleveland. This didn’t look like it was a sports bar, Tonya comments. Guys cheering for Cleveland (I don’t even know the name of their baseball team) but Boston is winning. In and around Seattle, I have found, the general consensus is that there is no place better to live. It was similar when I was in Portland in ‘01, maybe it’s a Pacific Northwest thing, this acceptance in both those who had traveled and those who hadn’t, that idea that nowhere was better. Mostly it hasn’t been raining today, although sometimes it has been and after sunset it’s a bit chilly. I’m not sure what to do now that I’ve found what is apparently the best area in the United States to call home. Pretty much, although the conversation digresses, we’re still talking—her repeatedly needing to stop and think—about the history of her love life, “or lack thereof”, she says. The guys are arguing with the TV screen, Look at that! He was safe! My eyes even settle on the screen, sometimes, for a bit. There’s the Boston Red Sox. Even if you’re from Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine, you’ll be looking at the team from New England’s most famous city and it’s something something even if you didn’t grow up watching sports it’s just, you remember, you remember before you broke away. You remember the hometown that now seems so quaint, and maybe your parents moved there and you moved away but it’s still where you come from, and a hundred something miles away there’s Boston, you can try to think of the smell or whatever, but in your mind it actually, it’s tied up in symbols, including but in no way limited to the local sports team and I say something about, “You know, I’ve never cared about sports, but I see the Red Sox on the TV and still…” then it’s another digression, and the rain probably starts and then stops again while we’re in there, and I went to see the opera today and I always want something new, not to possess but to consider. Mt. Rainier was out today. The mountain makes days better, when you can see the mountain. Marie called me up while I was at GRCC. She’s showing, listened to the little heartbeat inside her. 51 “You ought to consider adding some different colors to your wardrobe, though,” says Christine, “You really do look like you’ve been working backstage. Actually, what do you do for work?” “I work at a call center right now,” I say, “An answering service. ” “Oh,” she says. I think she’s waiting for me to comment on my lowly station. “Well, I’m a stay-at-home mom, so,” and she shrugs, outside of the Mexican restaurant, where it sometimes is raining a little and sometimes it’s not at all. It’s evening, not late night, and I’ve come here with Tonya. It’s the birthday of Trina, whose apartment I stopped in briefly prior to the opera on Sunday. Trina is resisting turning thirty, saying that she’s still twenty-nine. “I have two dates for tonight,” she has already said, “And one of them’s gay, but whatever. ” I drink two margaritas and eat a bowl of rice. I ask random questions to the guy who’s originally from Colorado. “Hey, our home teams are facing off,” I say to him when I see the World Series on the television, with Boston playing against Colorado. “Your team seems to be, uh, winning,” he says, since the score is something like 12-1. Trina’s (it seems quite safe to infer) straight date of the evening (who at another point whispers to the waitress that he wants to buy drinks for the two ladies at another table) is outside talking with the older guy about wanting to die with a smile on his face, “Because if you can do that, you know, it’s all been okay. ” I challenge this: “But what if you, like, stub your toe and at that moment as you’re wincing in pain a bullet catches you and you die on the spot? Does that mean that you’ve failed?” He takes this as an opportunity to talk about being shot, how he’s been shot before, how he smiled after being shot. “And it pisses them off,” he says, “You know that there are no more bullets in the gun…” Trina has said to me that Tonya is awesome and if I do anything to hurt her I’ll have to answer to her. She hasn’t really spoken to me otherwise. On the ride home Tonya is telling me that Christine (who tonight has said to me, “I like you! Hope to be seeing you around more”) had said that she could tell, on Sunday, that I was a nerd like them. So I return home, hug but don’t kiss Tonya goodnight. I think of Arden, have my keys and hold them in front of me as I walk to the apartment door. In the apartment Zella seems manic, having done laundry, having cleaned her room, having accomplished various other tasks from her to-do list. She talks about her tattoos. Oh, have I seen that one before? You should show off your ink more, I say, since she has just dyed her hair and she’s wearing a tank top and she is occasionally scrubbing her face and her wherever the black dye has dripped onto and it’s been a long day and night for me, I say that I probably am acting like I’m drunk but it’s just that I’m so tired. Fortunately I don’t have to work until noon. I sleep, come home after another (the shifts go by quickly) work day, watch a repeat of this week’s episode of South Park, tell myself that I can do this, can fall asleep, sit through an entire episode of Drawn Together, then The Daily Show and The Colbert Report and I think it’s The History Channel that I’m watching next, something about gamma ray bursts, and then it’s a different episode of the same program about the tsunami that hit Malaysia and Thailand in 2004. I’m finally falling asleep when Zella gets home. As usual when this happens, I am jerked awake; I sit up and say, “Hello?” then wait to hear the familiar voice to make sure she’s not the Bogeyman come to get me. She’s not the Bogeyman come to get me. In the morning, I am working on less than two hours’ sleep and I am somewhat moody but as time goes by I feel like I am handling calls well, confident, with good call control. Then I’m back home sleeping on the deflated air mattress and the feather-filled cushion thing on top of that, falling asleep with whatever is on the television at low volume to keep me company, next to the steno machine and the chair that’s in front of it, my homework assignment just like every class requiring me to listen to an MP3 from a CD that I was given, an MP3 of someone reading aloud exercises, so TPH stands for N and SKWR stands for J and the tape is all just on the floor, I stopped halfway through the exercise the last time I was doing it, and a few hours later Zella is home again and I’m sitting up again, “Hello?” and she’s in a better mood and while I’ve slept my cellular phone has beeped with text messages from both Arden and Tonya, the usual conversation with the former being about how we want to hold each other in bed and with the latter being random questions—”Who are your heroes?” she has asked today and I’ve responded, “My heroes are mostly friends of mine and people I’ve met. ” Lately I’ve been thinking of myself as, above all else, an Only Child. Zella seems in a better mood coming home today, is already about to leave to go to The Buckaroo in Seattle, she’s invited a whole bunch of people (co-workers and such) to head out for her birthday and some people will be arriving earlier and some people will be arriving later and I’m like, “Really?” and she sits and smokes a cigarette and I lie down and mumble a conversation with my eyes not really open for a little bit. I wake up at 9:30 PM or so, I could still head up there but would want to shave and shower first, then didn’t she say she might go somewhere else at some point? I get coffee, eat some more of a Domino’s Pizza that I had delivered last night. I drive for some drive-thru coffee and come home and type up the journal entries I’ve been writing onto paper usually in my car before work or during lunch breaks. In the morning I work and then come home and sleep and on Sunday it’s time for further exploration of the great Northwest, going with Tonya to the shore. It’s been years since I last saw the Pacific Ocean. Ooo! I notice, after I step here, my footprint immediately disappears! I’m really a child at heart, is what she takes from this, although I am actually in my mind trying to turn this into some kind of anti-parable about how there is no self, let alone a God. We get some food in Aberdeen, best known as the hometown of Kurt Cobain. Then we’re riding north on 101 in Tonya’s car past clear-cut forests. Until it’s national forest and we’re at Lake Quinault and at one of the empty camp sites in the woods I sit down on a picnic bench and smoke a cigarette. Back in Aberdeen I get a pizza with pineapple on it and she gets a lasagna. We’re sitting there and on the TV is what will prove to be the last game of this World Series, with the Boston Red Sox winning it. In Olympia I say that I can hang out for a bit and she hands me wine while I’m going through her books. We’re talking and I ask her how many people she’s made out with. Three, including me, she says. She has said to me already, “You’re having a hard time wrapping your head around this, aren’t you? But it’s okay…” Outside on her porch-thing overhanging, post-dusk, people still walking and the leaves drifting about, yes she has an ashtray out there because many of the people she knows are smokers. Some moments get frozen like snapshots and it’s like I’ve stepped into one particular moment I remember from Liv’s back porch in Longmeadow, Massachusetts. This moment complicates that one. In this moment I ask Tonya what she thinks is sexy and she says something about how someone wanting her is sexy. It takes me some moments of looking (there of course being some artificial light, a porch light above us, so it feels as though we’re indoors even when we’re outdoors) at the leaves until I’m ready to say that I think I can relate to that. On her couch, I’m telling her how I came of age without a strong father figure, without a strong mother figure, without trusting myself under anyone else’s wing. How I’ve had a staggering amount of freedom, how I’m so lucky even though it’s lonely, even though when I’m looking for friends I’m really looking for a family, “But I’ll probably always be this lonely. It’s incredible. Here I am, living where I want to live, doing what I want to be doing. ” I’ve lived without the trappings of wealth, without the trappings of poverty. Only in America, I want to think, could I be so confused about what my proper place is. Only in America could I belong everywhere and nowhere, always and never finding love. I travel for thousands of miles and still find myself here in this same country, an American in America, wandering America. My generation does this. You hear it in news stories on the radio. We move all over the place. We’re chasing jobs and we’re chasing partners. Neither will last for long. We’re pilgrims to our own ongoing lives. She invites me to sleep next to her this time. Under the covers I ask, “What are your intentions with me?” and she says, “My intentions are to ravish you,” or something like that. Several hours later I’m off to work, then to class. I’m catching up in steno class, only now beginning to keep pace. "

    "body": "52 I stay over at Tonya’s again. She tries to teach me to cook, but I’m slightly afraid of the soup she’s making, and anyway she prepared the broth earlier in the day and that took hours? That isn’t a lifestyle I have access to. In the morning we go thrifting for me, and I get two shirts as well as a pair of gloves. Arden has started reading my Life Story. She is texting me vaguely, emotional in Pennsylvania with not only Secret but also another cat now. Days go by, days go by. I do nothing for Halloween. Then it’s November. I continue working. I’m happy. “Hi, roommate!” is a common greeting between me and Zella. I get my recording gear up and working, write a new song. Am feeling generally inspired. Want to be active. Go out there and make a difference. I notice that it’s common for one or another of my co-workers to have an emotional outburst, either crying or cursing. Meanwhile I’m usually just fidgeting. There are mornings when I’m early for work, if the traffic has been light, and so I’m driving around Issaquah. The weather has been nice—not especially cold, hardly raining at all. A recent LiveJournal post by Julian said that he has been feeling down because of the change in seasons. The clocks have now been turned back for Daylight Savings Time. Marie in Arizona is now an hour later than I am here. The office is moving to Seattle this month. During the transition we’ll all be working as remote agents. I haven’t heard any word about Alix for months, I realize when I come around to remembering her. Life just goes on. People ask, hasn’t 2007 flown by? Isn’t it crazy, overall, how so many years have passed? Doesn’t time move more quickly as you get older? No, not really. Child of beauty, sparkle in the twilight, the edge of what is forever. Contents of the jar revealed. Open up open up. When I sit down to write songs I’m inspired again, but imagery alone is not so purely moving as it was to me when I was younger. I have heard these words combined before. All is complex and stable. I am prepared to inhabit this world. I wish that I were sleeping. Life is dangerous. I think that I’ll make it. That is my feeling. Credit bubble. I walk to the living room from the bathroom and see my coat thrown over a chair and go, “Ah!” in a genuine momentary surprise and fear, reacting like it’s a person there. I circumvent fortunately. Internet. We’ve known for years. Couldn’t really say how, it’s all vague, information in our heads, but from youth we don’t know, we have never known privacy. Who is, who agrees with, Anne Frank, homework, suburban, make it up, this benevolence, encompassing rather than annihilating the notion of God, the Western chess board, the vast expanse of beautiful land from sea to shining sea. “Dog the Bounty Hunter”, who has a show on cable television, was recorded using a racial slur. His son sold the tape to the National Enquirer. See Dog, then, on Larry King Live. Larry King, this funny media staple, what else is on tonight, a special about Charles Manson, he can’t be interviewed anymore per California law so it’s just another look at him being interviewed in the 1980s. Also on TV is real-life murder by a teenage vampire clan. The daughter of dead parents in an interviewer’s light, saying that where she grew up was not her idea of a good time. Chris Benoit, professional wrestler, killed his family and himself and this television program investigates. Trying to fall asleep, not even thinking but watching on the television these thoughts on brutality. I walk to the kitchen and then back to the living room and again I am startled by the coat on the chair, which for some reason appears to me like the ghost of a dancer. 53 Zella’s mom is impressed by the cleanliness of our apartment. I wake up around 11 PM, having been asleep in my room since 5. Immediately she’s hugging me and then talking. I smile and wipe the sleep from my eyes and say that I would like to make coffee. She follows me into the kitchen while Zella stays in her room. “I always knew what you were all about,” she says to me, in a positive way. She talks about the difficulties inherent in being an only child (as both Zella and I were). I surprise myself by saying, “But I think it helps, in certain ways,” because I think it does. When she asks about “my parents”, though, and have they visited? I’m reminded that I have parents. She returns to Zella’s room. I’ve opened up my laptop and am gazing lazily at its screen under three overhead lights (among which, one needs its light bulb changed, perhaps I’ll do that someday). No, I usually feel amazingly fortunate for being an only child. I feel unfortunate, however, that hugging a friend’s mother seems more normal to me than hugging my own mother would. I’ve seen my father in person only a few times this decade. For the most part we’ve corresponded by email. He’ll be spending some time at a monastery in Florida soon. People know me and call me optimistic. It’s true. I am. At my core is a black hole devoid of faith; that’s the reason why I’m happy. That’s the reason why I love. I change. I’m happy. I love you. 54 Nov. 12. At around 3:30 in the morning, Zella returns to the apartment. Man, I’ve slept for a long time, and as it turns out I also left the heat on at an absurdly high temperature. “Yeah,” she says, “I came home at like 4:30 and you were already passed out there in front of the TV. ” It’s odd how little free time it feels that I have. Even the days off don’t have enough hours. I’m still not ready to complain. A few hours later I’m in Issaquah, at the Starbucks, writing in my journal. I just said, fuck it, and didn’t shave or shower, rather than worrying about when I should leave so as not to be late. So, in addition to trying to write songs for that album I’ve promised myself I will record by the end of the year, I’ve started looking for other jobs, just in case. If I could come up with a valid-sounding excuse for wanting a different job, I might be able to earn some more. And so on and so on in another temporary place. 55 Then comes Veteran’s Day, or whatever that holiday is. I’m working and it sucks. They’ve had me work through the weekend, but at least I have both Tuesday and Wednesday off… until Tuesday morning, when I’m woken up by a phone call asking if I’d be so kind as to come in and work for awhile. I say yes, earn some overtime, then follow through with my plans to go visit with Tonya. We eat out at the place she says was better before it was bought out by McMenamin’s. I get a veggie burger with bacon, tater tots, beer, 7-Up, and water. As usual, once we’re back at her place, she opens up a bottle of red wine and we sit down on her couch. I stay over. In the morning, she has to work. I drive home and fall asleep for several hours. Then it’s afternoon. My Mom called the day before to let me know that my copies of the issue of Lady Churchill’s Rosebud Wristlet containing my story, “The Curmudgeon”, have arrived. I take the time to actually put something up at my web site again, and to work on music. I don’t do laundry. The night goes by and when I know that Arden will be awake I’m texting her, asking her—if she could, would she want to be with me? She’s responding that, with how much she thinks of me when I’m away and how much she can’t keep her hands off me when I’m there, how could she not want to be with me? I’m in the parking lot at work, waiting for it to be time to start my shift. Then I’m working. “It’s just you and me moving to the Seattle office,” says Talisha—everyone else is going remote before that. I still need to be trained on some new things first. At one point recently, I tried to attend a karaoke night meetup (from the Meetup web site) in Seattle, but got totally lost and then stuck in traffic. Now I’m in the car waiting to start work again. It seems like I’m always in this parking lot, these days. There are much worse places to be, of course. I slept for twelve hours last night. I woke up naturally from a dream about driving around some city, I don’t know which one, with Lydia. In the dark, then, waking up, I turned on the television to see what time it was. It was 4 AM. I heard an alarm going off in Zella’s room. I knocked on the door until it went away. Everything is getting darker. 56 Why am I doing this court reporting thing? I would have to say it’s mostly because of my long-standing dream of leaving the country. If not for that, it might not seem worth it to me. 57 I vroom vroom vroomed to nighttime Seattle Center, as usual keeping an eye on the Space Needle for direction. I was going to Club Noc Noc again. There, I text messaged with Arden and danced on the dance floor. Moving around under flashing lights, I thought to myself how random this quality of mine might seem—you might not expect me to be dancing like this, to music like this, and you might not expect me to feel like I should always do this (if you didn’t know about my history with goth clubs) but this is a way for me to have some sort of ritual, something simple that I don’t need anyone else’s involvement to do (although delightfully, others are of course around, sneaking their way past me, our arms accidentally touching when they spin and I turn) and I’m in my body here rather than only in my head. As I’m walking back to my car (and I’ve hardly been inside the club for any time at all, at this point, and I haven’t spoken with anyone) I give Arden a call. That’s nice. She’s back from a Buck 65 concert. Yes, she did finish reading Book One of the Life Story. She expressed mixed feelings about becoming a “character” in it. “And when you asked me whether we would stay in touch, do you remember?” “Yes, of course. ” “You do?” “Yes, I remember that. ” “You said that you wanted me to be a character in your story. And I probably didn’t say anything, but I sort of wondered, is this something that he does, a way of keeping people at a distance maybe? But that’s not what I think now. ” And someone passing by, in Seattle, around 7th and Olive, I see him wag his finger at me. I’ve sat down in my car and it’s idling. I can’t figure out what he’s wagging his finger at me for, but I later decide that he was probably chiding me for wasting gas. I sleep, wake up around I don’t even know, something like 3:30 in the afternoon. I eat a Pop-Tart and shower, go to Dairy Queen for a chicken strips basket, go to Panera Bread for coffee. Arden is texting about how she wants to be in my arms. I know that I could go see Tonya tonight, but I haven’t practiced steno at all this week, plus I have some dumb non-steno assignments that I should do as well. I’m not sure how I’ll manage to get any sleep tonight. I was supposed to purchase a headset for when I go remote. I go to the bathroom in Panera Bread and for a moment worry that I might have accidentally gone into the ladies’ room, because it doesn’t look like the bathroom of the Panera Bread in Springfield, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. I apparently expect to step through a door and be able to defecate on the other side of the country. 58 “Oh, that’s it. It’s on, world,” I’m thinking to myself, coming home. En garde! Take that, you vague stale scent in the living room! I learned that my loan was refused because “I was already disbursed” a loan at Johns Hopkins University. So I call JHU. Somebody calls me back. She’s nice, says that I don’t owe anything, the funds were received by the college and then sent back. It looks like this may be for me and the NSLDF (the federal loan-giving whatever) to sort out. This was after another night of sharing a bed with Tonya. It’s the day before Thanksgiving. Arden IMing me before she catches a flight to Arizona to see her family. I wish that I were going there with her. I’m all set up to work as a remote agent for the first time this coming weekend. I’m able to make phone calls over the Internet (through a program called Skype) now. 59 I seem to have grabbed the last solo chair at the Wayward Coffeehouse. Here to get out and chill and to watch the filk music open mic. Yes, I mean filk. 60 That terrible Thanksgiving Day, just a couple of days ago, but now it seems long behind me. (It involved me being very late to work, everyone hating me, the teenage daughter who worked part-time storming out, quitting in the midst of when-was-her-boyfriend-going-to-pick-her-up drama, and the boyfriend flipping off Talisha from outside the window, and I’m taking calls and trying to be attentive and polite. ) (And really I’m at the filk night now—science fiction nerds singing jolly songs about fantasy characters. ) Friday was overwhelming, too. Saturday—that is, today—was my first day working as a remote agent. Sitting on the living room floor in front of my laptop, plugged in by a headset. The computer resting on the chair. The days now are generally coat-wearing weather, but not what I would call cold. In the mornings, though, I usually need to scrape the windshield. 61 I was instructed to work my Monday shift remotely as well, since the Seattle office was not ready for business yet. I did so. Then I tried canceling the cable television but was talked into keeping the subscription at a discounted price. Then I went to steno class. Then I came home and watched Zella cook a pound of bacon. I ate a bunch of it as she was cooking. What was left she then mashed up in a bowl with tater tots, American cheese, mustard, and ketchup. She retreated to her room, ate half of it, then left the house. Now it’s 9 o’clock. I’m chatting online. 62 Bothell, Washington. A Denny’s with a fireplace. Leaving Seattle from the coffee house, I accidentally found myself driving northbound… so I kept going until I reached Bellingham. I found the center of town and walked around there. Lots of people out, smoking in front of food-places, slurring excitedly in front of bars. Saturday night. I stopped in front of a bar where I heard live music playing. I asked what it would cost to get in. I was told eight bucks. I shrugged and walk back to my car. Stopped at a gas station. Bought some candy and soda. I turn on the radio and can instantly tell that I’m listening to Canadian music. It’s hard to explain how I know that these aren’t American songs… but it’s obvious. I stop paying attention to the radio when I get distracted by the beautiful sky and the full moon. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest never ceases to have its effect on me. The next thing I know, what I hear coming through the radio is a sort of sound collage, expertly composed, involving classical instruments, their sounds transforming into each other. Wasn’t that clarinet? Now it’s saxophone. Double bass? I stop at the Denny’s with the fireplace. Well, I suppose it’s not as if firewood is hard to come by in this part of the country. 63 Then it’s December. The new office, in what is effectively an alleyway in Seattle. On smoke breaks, when the weather is not rainy, I walk and look off at the horizon buildings. Pretty much being what I think of as “productive” every day, cleaning or doing homework or paying bills, continuing to try to come up with a way to procure a mattress. I should have changed over to a Washington license within thirty days of establishing residence here. A jumble of time. Arden booking tickets to visit me in January. Me missing her. Me booking a cabin for the nearer future in which to work on recording that CD. Me writing songs. Me visiting Tonya sometimes. Me trying to talk to other locals online but no other friendships blossoming. Me making repeated phone calls to Johns Hopkins until finally I’m told that my loan situation was worked out. Sometimes I’m sad. Usually I’m busy and a little bit proud of myself. A few resumés sent out, a telephone interview for a data entry position, me ordering new contact lenses. Me dreaming about living in a different country. “I see,” Julian responds when I describe what things have been like. “So, the usual. ” 64 The thought of camping sort of takes me back to being in a tent with my father, across the St. Lawrence from Quebec City. Back then we were at a site near the water with a black and white portable television whose antenna would catch episodes of Asterix and Obelix. I’ve reserved a cabin in a state park. No one really does that in December. The idea is mostly to record some songs in a private setting, where I might worry less about neighbors… but I forgot to bring my microphone. 65 I drive the 101 around the Olympic Peninsula, knowing that when I reach Olympia I’ll be heading to Tonya’s. It’s one month to the day until Arden visits. I stop at a Jack in the Box in Aberdeen, to stretch my legs and get some value menu food. I’ve been listening to some important man on the radio talking about global warming. (A bad rainstorm recently led to a lot of bad flooding here in Aberdeen. The radio let people know that a local bank is offering expedited loans. ) Kids in old blue jeans with unwashed hair lurk around. Did they move here to absorb something of what turned Kurt Cobain into a rock star? Each has his or her own story. I think back to wandering in Olympia with Tonya… outside of King Solomon’s Reef, the girl with the fingerless gloves playing acoustic guitar, wearing a Nirvana shirt. I think of the course that I’ve driven today, a line as it would look across a map of western Washington… the road around the green of the Olympics. Along that road, the miles between settlements. Sequim, Port Angeles, Forks. The van in front of me going too slowly for my tastes. Texting people back on the east coast, telling them about the loveliness. Other things I would like to be doing. Figuring that I probably won’t be in Washington for longer than a year, wanting to squeeze in time for all of what I would like to do while I’m here. I’m like this, just wanting to stop for coffee at all those little dots on the map. “Are you lonely out there? I hope you’re content. ” —Salma texting me. “I could see myself enjoying a routine here” —in Port Angeles, thinking now that I can’t entirely shake my liking for small towns, walking in the downtown, stopping at a coffee shop. When I left the state park, driving north from Poulsbo, crossing that bridge over water with the mountains looming there awesomely. I can’t believe I’m going back to work on Thursday. Visiting with Tonya, getting drunk. In the morning I sit for coffee, use the wireless at Caffé Vita. There are, as you walk the street, the typical holiday displays of lights and garland, which you would see anywhere. I’m not much one for Christmas. In my long, dark coat I keep walking. I wake up some more, then drive back to my apartment in Kent. 66 I take a call answering for a church. The woman says, “I want to put in a request for prayer. ” I think to myself, Oh, good. At least this will be interesting. First she asks for prayers for, I dunno, like a sick father or something. (If you think that I would remember a detail like that, you don’t know how many sick people I hear about in a day. Sometimes it’s an ongoing saga, nurses calling for doctors about a patient until the patient passes away. Then I take calls for bodies to be picked up. ) Then the woman also wants prayer for herself, regarding “the dark forces”. At work, she means. She’s talking, talking and while I would normally summarize to keep the message short I’m instead just transcribing as much of it as I can. She is saying things like “I do believe in evil forces, like witchcraft—the bible tells us to watch out for it” and that it seems like the forces are always after her and that she gives in, and she cusses, and she loses faith, and she doesn’t want to, and she feels disappointed in herself. It had been a horrible morning. Whereas for the past few weekends I’ve been working from home, using the headset and year’s unlimited subscription to Skype, the online phone service all of us in the call center were made to purchase… that’s not happening anymore. Most of my coworkers had been working from home each day. But no, now everyone needs to commute to Seattle. And this morning, when I had arrived, the system had been down. “Don’t bother to turn on,” I had been told. I had already needed to walk around the building, because apparently the door we usually enter through isn’t opened on weekends. Everyone in the room has complaints, is complaining, so I don’t feel out of line when I say, “Wow. I find out yesterday that I’m coming in today, no one tells me that I’ll have to come in through the back door, and now the system’s down? Well, that’s great. ” To which I receive silence. “You can’t be late anymore, Levi,” Talisha says. “I wasn’t late,” I said. “You were scheduled for six,” says Talisha. “I was scheduled for seven. ” Then, the realization that Mike had changed the schedule midway through the week without mentioning it—again. She and another employee step out “for a smoke” while I’m to remain inside. I hear Talisha screaming. At lunch I drive towards the Burger King. I feel and hear that there is something wrong with the car. I gather that it’s probably one of my tires and after I have my food I get out to check and yes, my front right tire is pretty much flat. There’s an air machine in front of the 7-11 next door, so I use that and drive back to work. By the time I’m on my last ten-minute break, my co-worker Allen—a recent hire—is himself stepping outside for a smoke or whatever. “Do you know anything about tires?” I ask. He says with a smile that he knows lots about tires, takes a look at the tire and says that when I finish my shift I should fill it with air again, then drive somewhere to get it patched up. At 3:30 I punch out and drive back to the 7-11. The man at the counter gives me 4 quarters in exchange for a dollar. As I walk to the air machine (in front of which I’ve already parked) a teenager is standing there. He asks for change. “Hey, help me out, I’m trying to get some…” I’m not paying attention to the specifics. The quarter between my fingers isn’t going into the slot—the machine is jammed. “I’m trying to get some air,” I retort. “Well, you’re not going to get any,” he says. I drop a quarter in his hand and keep the other seventy-five cents, in case I see another machine. But I don’t, until I’ve driven a distance down Rainier Avenue and reached a tire place, where I learn that a nail is stuck in one of my tires. They patch it up and reinflate the tire for me. "

    "title": "XV. A Rainy Season (67-75)",
    "body": "67 Mike is fifteen minutes late on Sunday morning. I’ve been waiting in my car. “Is it just me,” he says, disarming the alarm system, while the two of us each hold our coffees, “Or is it asinine to have a call center open for two or three people?” “I would agree with that,” I say, “I liked being remote. I didn’t have any problems with it. ” “The call center is closed on Sundays, as of the end of this shift,” he says. We walk down the hall to our little room, where cubicle walls block out most of what passes for sunlight here in December.  No,  he changes his mind,  Don't turn on. How would you like to work remotely today?  “That would be great,” I say. So he sends me home. I work my shift, then pack my car and drive to the Olympic Peninsula. It’s dark and rainy. Other vehicles pass me often. I wish that I had my contact lenses. I will have them soon. I drive the wrong way on 101, mistakenly thinking that the cabin will be around Quilcene. I go an impressive distance in the wrong direction and after driving around, at the edge of one of the Olympic National Forest welcome signs I pull over and call Arden. Occasional traffic passes by. I just barely have reception, then it gets lost. “What?” she says, “I’m only hearing about one out of every six words you say. ” Windshield wipers. Dark. Funny how different these beautiful places are between night and day. I’m asking for help. “Sure,” she says, “Let me boot up my computer. ” Finally, after looking more extensively in my atlas, I realize my mistake. The instructions on the web site do a terrible job of explaining how to get to the Louella Cabin. In fact, they seem to be specifically designed to lead me astray in the way that they did, a mile or so along access roads. That view must be great during the daylight. I get out of the car, the ground is so wet, I’m kicking fallen pine branches out of the way and at least it isn’t raining here and now, in the headlights powder and moisture and needles, the cabin has electric light and beds and I will be in the place where I will know that I will sleep tonight, if only I make it there. I keep driving, these are more like vehicle tracks than anything resembling road, I’m just at the edge, a city boy, my little Saturn liable to get stuck, but I will just drive this a little ways. No, this couldn’t be. This couldn’t be where the cabin is, but maybe life will surprise me. How many other things are not supposed to be? How much else can you find if you nudge just a bit deeper? This isn’t what I think of when I think of forest. I think of forests as places where you can find the foundations of old settlements. You belong in those places; they’ll let you hide. But where I am now is not that sort of forest. This place doesn’t need you. Its pride is on a different scale. This forest mingles proudly with the mountains and moon and cloud cover. You are just an insect. Once I’ve finally found the cabin I bring in my things, set up my computer and microphone, lay out my guitar and hook up cables and plug in everything and uncork another cheap bottle of pink wine and start recording. I forget to eat, playing guitar and singing and mixing. On cigarette breaks I’m impressed by the quiet. It’s something to contend with. Sad to be alone. Sad not to be in another century. I don’t want to burn out, don’t want to be a brief candle. Sometimes I wish I had a spouse, someone to see me. Certainly many couples come here—couples and families and groups of friends, skiing buddies, and so on. “I was raised by crows in the city,” I sing, “I was raised by crows all alone. If you were raised by crows, too, then you would understand!” I laugh. No, that’ll be left off the CD. No, I’ll put it on there. No, it doesn’t matter. The last time I visited her in Olympia, Tonya said to me, “I’m continually impressed, based on what I know of your thus far, to find you so optimistic. It seems like that could be very different, given how your life has gone. ” I told her that that’s my rebellious nature—that I associate cynicism, and views of mankind as inherently evil, with a status quo that keeps people desperate and disconnected enough to believe that life is just about “getting”, “taking”, “giving”, or “donating”. Life, I say, is about changing and being changed. In the morning I drive back to Kent, lie down on the floor for forty-five minutes, then drive to Seattle and work the late shift. I come home, write this, and now my deflated air mattress is calling for me to come and sleep on it. I have the next two days off. Only seven shopping days left before Christmas. 68 Dec. 27. During my last ten-minute break at work, there in an alley under the gray Seattle sky, I notice that I’ve stepped in a puddle of not-just-water. Maybe it was gasoline—I have no idea—but whatever it was, I now find that wherever I step, I’m leaving colors. They’re seemingly the only colors within sight. Trying to be sure that my shoe is rinsed off, I step in a different puddle… now this one is turning pink and purple, the colors drifting from where I displace the water. I make it my ten-minute quest, then, to step in every puddle in this area of pavement. I walk also along a long and narrow stream of water so that the colors follow behind me in a trail. I had yesterday off; I worked on Christmas. The Christmas shift was actually very mellow, probably a better way to spend my time than sitting around in my apartment would have been. I have been, in general, super-depressed—about a technicality stopping me from being able to get financial aid and therefore, it seems, preventing me from taking steno classes anymore. I don’t even know. The bad days at work have been really bad, and although things have settled down recently I’m still afraid. I’m lonely, lonely, lonely. Driving around listening to my depressing songs all the time—the “album” is almost if not entirely finished now—has probably not been helping. Even when I’m not just working and sleeping and watching DVDs it’s like… well, like last night, I went to the Blue Moon in the U District, Seattle, for an open mic. I signed up, but after sitting around drinking a pint and reading some of an issue of Glimmer Train that was lying around I changed my mind about wanting to play and drove home. Online I ended up chatting with someone who right off the bat said that I seemed like a wonderful person she would love to have as a friend. She suggested that if she didn’t have to work we should meet up for coffee the next day. Sending a text message while on break, though, it was confirmed that she did in fact need to work. Julian wants to fly out here in late spring. His loyalty is pretty astonishing.  Arden arrives in two weeks. 69 New Year’s Eve day, I upload my newly-recorded album, Flowers Smoking Cigarettes, to the Internet. Mike calls me up and asks if I’ll work remotely for two hours. I say yes. I go to a goth New Year’s thing in Seattle and dance… can’t get to the bar for more than one drink, there’s too much of a line… I arrive home several minutes before 2008, apparently missing a surprise appearance by the musician Aurelio Voltaire. I call Arden, who is still awake and texting me. It’s already 2008 there. Back to working the phone lines: “We think my fiancée just miscarried,” a man tells me. Halfway through my collecting the information, the woman in the background starts screaming an awful, heart-breaking, top-of-her-lungs scream. I have two other calls on the line; the guy who’s complaining about his cable television subscription and how certain channels are no longer available is aggressive and takes that I’m-going-to-lecture-you voice: “What were you doing while I was on hold?” If only you knew, sir. If only you knew. 70 Coffee Time. Portland, Oregon. It definitely still smells the way it did six and a half years ago. Ever since, driving into the city, I oriented myself by recognizing Pioneer Square, it’s been like a tour of all the places I can remember, which all look exactly the same. The Roxy and Rocco’s Pizza, and Powell’s, where of course I had to look and see the issue of Lady Churchill’s Rosebud Wristlet with my story in it on the shelf. I decided to drive here for no particular reason other than that it was a dreary morning and I have the day off. Now I’m in a good mood. Bluejay has texted me directions to their work. 71 Back at Coffee Time! Again! After some driving I met up with Bluejay at the hospital where they’re working. We got food from the little cafeteria there and chatted. Yeah, I definitely don’t want to leave now that I’m back in Portland again. People seem like people and not like monsters; that’s the difference, to my mind. “Is there an ATM nearby?” I asked the barista here. “Well, what bank do you use?” “Ah, just any one will be fine. ” “We have one in here, but it charges a fee. ” “Oh, that’s okay. ” I take money out from the ATM, then go back to the counter and say, “Okay! I have money to pay for my beverage now. ” “We take cards, just so you know,” the barista says, “But I guess I should have told you that before. Everywhere takes cards now. (Pause. ) Well, not everywhere, but…” She looks down at the register and hands me my change. It’s like a part of me never left this headspace. It must be the smell, yes, but also the people. It’s being somewhere and not feeling embarrassed or strange for sitting and writing this way. What I’m feeling right now is the sort of feeling that led me to hand out “friendship applications” to strangers. Am I just in shock at finding everything so unchanged from how I remembered that strange summer I spent out here… or is this feeling something more real than that? Is Portland real? 72 I give up waiting for the restroom key and wander instead to the Starbucks on NW 23rd. Then I drive to pick up Bluejay from work. At their place I say, “Hey, I remember this stuff! I helped to pack some of it!” We’re in a different dimension from Philly, now. We walk the older of her two new pugs, play Guitar Hero 3 until Rob gets home, and have pizza delivered while we watch Home Movies on demand. Then I drive back to Washington. Every day at work for the next eternity I am constantly fielding three calls and scared that a whip will crack if I don’t manage them as efficiently as possible. I am sleepless and generally unwashed. It is surprising to me that I can be so unhappy as a result of a bold decision, a thought-through decision. Maybe this is all that there is. Maybe this is how work has to be. Maybe sane people don’t want to hug. Maybe sane people dedicate themselves to making others miserable in the way that they are miserable—because otherwise, they would be down here forever, striving to do better at a job they already can do well. Maybe this is where the Life Story leads—journal entry after journal entry of, “Work made me hate myself and everyone else. I still did it. Then I watched a movie. ” Maybe the rainy season is getting to me, after all—but then again, a stroll in the rain can give me great pleasure, and sometimes it feels so lovely. A gray Seattle is still a beautiful Seattle. I write a letter of resignation on Friday night and keep it in the “Drafts” folder of my email. Arden visits next weekend. I want those days off. At least next Saturday… Which will be on this next schedule… when it arrives. The schedule has still not arrived. It is supposed to be sent by email. Yesterday (Friday) Mike took me aside and said that they’re working on setting up a different platform for remote agents but it’s not a near-future thing. We work in Seattle now. And by the way, he tells me, I can expect to be written up for my tardiness. Much more of that and it’s to the point where I may have to be “released”. I am doing my best to consider every job posting in greater Seattle. I read thousands of them, day after day, and apply to a handful. I get a call back on Friday from a musical theatre that’s seeking someone full-time in their ticket center. Yes! That sounds great! I listen to the voice mail. When can I interview? I’ll just call back when I get my work schedule for this week. And that will be… when? 73 Jan. 9. Two job interviews in Seattle tomorrow. One would pay the same as what I make now, but would likely be a better work environment… less stressful, certainly better hours, without my being made to purchase the equipment I work on. One downside being, the experience would be somewhat less valuable—it sounds like simpler work. The other seems like it would be all-around better. Better pay, work that I would rather be doing, good experience. Long-term temporary, lasting until around the time my lease is up. I’ve been trying to bring myself to quit my present job. Problematically, the experience of going in there each day and striving to be pleasant, working to continually bring up stats, worrying about which of my co-workers may dislike me and to what extent… this feels like all that I have going for me right now. There is a newness to how cold I feel working this job. Sympathy without empathy lets me quietly feel human while staring at the screen, even though I am called a machine every day. In the background I hear, “Ow, ow, ow” from a woman giving birth. A wounded dog howling. Another caller is on hold and a third is coming in. Answer, “Thank you for calling. ” I’m the company for the span of a call. A thousand faceless faces. I’m asked how quickly I can send an ambulance to meet the airlift helicopter. The house is flooding, how soon will I be out? Will I tow the car that’s parked in someone else’s spot? How long a wait for the delivery of an oxygen tank? The refilling of an oil tank? The fixing of a trailer’s flat tire? Floral arrangements for cemeteries. People who need to be let out of parking garages. Why is the login not working? The family is living out of a hotel and today is the last day—checkout is a few hours from now—can I help? When can the customer expect a reimbursement? No one I work with has expressed sentiment about handling such calls. Callers tell me that they’re suicidal, about to blow up the world. I may have seen them in the paper; they’re calling from prison. Why am I asking for a zip code—where am I? When they ask me where I am, it’s a difficult question. I’m in Seattle, but we’re also in Spokane, and sometimes I’m in my living room. Sometimes I’m in my living room working for a company in Seattle and Spokane which is answering for a company that handles calls for apartments in Hawaii from a city that is someplace else. “You’re not even in Iowa, are you?” No. I’m also not in Mississippi, Alaska, or Massachusetts. Another distant voice’s foreign accent. Another pre-recorded call advertising business loans, friendly and casual—”I’ll get right to the point. ” Not quickly enough for my typing fingers—there’s an attorney waiting for a message from his client. A business owner, calling every so often to see if we can answer quickly. None of us who work this job meet the expectations set for us. I get home and sleep. I wake up in the night and it’s back to the job search. If I’m late again, I’ll likely be fired. But this is, all things considered, the best job that I have ever had. This is my fortunate life. 74 My first scheduled interview of the day—at Providence Hospice, just north of downtown Seattle—was moved earlier. They called the night before. In the morning, I take awhile to crawl off of my mattress; I get lost and arrive fashionably late. “You seem nervous,” says the woman who is interviewing me. I am nervous. As usual, my responses to questions alternate between mumbled “um”s, “hm”s, my staring into space to avoid staring at my knees… and bright, articulate responses delivered with a smile. I figure that I will probably not get the position. I walk past my car a little bit and go into a friendly little coffee place, which doesn’t really have anywhere to sit. I get a coffee to go, conversing pleasantly with the guy behind the counter. I drive home, spend the early afternoon reading about the presidential primaries… then get a phone call with a job offer. The pay for this forty-hour-per-week position as a Data Entry something-or-other is $14. 30 per hour. Ideas of how I could splurge at this level of income spring to mind. I could see a dentist! I could double the amount I typically pay against my credit card debt, sending checks biweekly rather than monthly so as to lessen the daily-compounded interest! I could buy shirts at H&amp;M! The possibilities are slightly less limited than they were before! To celebrate, I do what anyone would do—I take myself out to eat at the A&amp;W. A toddler keeps saying, “Mommy!” but it sounds to me like she’s saying, “Money! Money!” 75 After my last break, I pause at Mike’s desk and say, “Hey, could I talk to you for a few minutes before the end of my shift?” but when it’s time for me to leave, he’s not around. It’s my little secret, then. Whatever. I could wait a week and it would still be two weeks’ notice. I get home and nap, as has lately been my habit. I start cleaning in advance of Arden’s arrival. I get distracted by Republican debates. McCain’s the one I find likable, as much as I disagree with him politically. He at least appears sane. Ron Paul, on the other hand, comes across as a raving lunatic. Barack Obama won the Iowa caucus, against most people’s expectations. Since I don’t have a printer, I write with pen onto paper: “(Helpful excerpts from) Minimum paid rest period requirements under state law”. I put it in my pocket in case I have to pull it out and state my case against the unfair and illegal break time rules I am now refusing to follow. (Ron Paul would not approve. ) "

    "body": "76 So I’m sitting on a chair near an escalator by where Arden has already entered the terminal from the plane. Until she finds me. Then, of course, we’re hugging. I drive us to my apartment. I don’t even remember. I’m happy enough that I don’t feel the need to remember. In the morning we go to Seattle. She takes a picture of the Space Needle. A walk to the sculpture park. Looking at the water. A pizza pub is open specifically for the Seahawks game. She talks to me about her family. “YEAH!” shout the football fans. We watch the television screen as one of the players runs a long distance. He is tackled just short of the goal line. “That was a pretty good play,” she admits, although we’re not sports fans. The team easily covers the remaining distance. “He went the whole one yard,” I comment. To each of us one beer and two slices of pizza. “We should get back to the car before the parking runs out,” I comment. Back to my apartment, it’s fully possible that I take a nap while she stays awake and reads. Certainly we’re in my room, on the mattress. At this point the weekend is feeling wonderfully long. I remember her curling up to me at one point during the weekend. When? I’m not sure. Had she gone to the bathroom? Been reading? Saying something like, “I was thinking that when I came out here to visit, you would be wanting me to make a decision…” A decision about us trying a relationship. We’re on opposite coasts, but neither of us really have roots where we are. We know where we want to see, but not where we want to be. For the hell of it I figure we can go to Olympia, do some dinner and karaoke. At King Solomon’s Reef I grab a copy of The Stranger. “That’s an odd name for a paper,” she says, thumbing through the pages of sex ads and concert listings. “Why, what are your alternative weeklies called?” I mean in Portland, Maine, which is kind of where her heart is, although I don’t specify. “I’m not sure there is one. ” “Oh, you never read them? I mean, like, the free newspapers you’ll see in stores, or walking down the street, I think every city has them…” but it’s one of those sentences where I’m boring myself, so I mumble as the words progress. We find a place that I knew was having karaoke. Arden pulls on the door, but the bouncer says something and pulls it back shut. “What did he say?” I ask. It turns out that we’ve just stepped in front of a line. “Yeah,” says a girl who’s been waiting, “It’s not the type of place where there’s usually a line, either. ” Dressed up for the bar scene, smoking cigarettes, they stand there and we keep walking. We walk a couple of blocks and there are fewer people around. I say, “This is a good town to come to and notice my ever-aging perspective on… youth culture. ” Arden is distracted by the sound of live metal coming from a side street. We veer in that direction. “Performance space,” she says. We stand outside and look at the flyers, peek inside to see the people thrashing against each other. We keep walking. Outside of a place that we passed earlier, I ask, “Wanna try here?” Jakes 4th Avenue. Turns out to be a gay bar—at least, that’s what a little sign tells you once you’re inside. “It’s such a range of people,” she says, “I’m not used to this many straight people in a gay bar, let alone such eclectic ones. ” But this is exactly the type of scene that I’m used to. “I really enjoyed that,” she says afterward about our time spent sitting, drinking beer, holding hands and commenting on people on the dance floor—”I just got an eyeful from Master and Schoolgirl. ” “Oh, look—the girl in the leotard has a friend and she’s just as cool!” “I like watching straight guys dance with their girlfriends,” she says at one point. “Really? I tend to find it disturbing. ” A girl in tight clothes bumps her butt against the crotch of a short-haired blond dude. We sleep in on Sunday—or at least I do, and although I start to wake up a couple times and she’s already awake, she lulls me back to sleep. For someone who is generally an insomniac, anxious and tense about everything, with Arden around I’ve always been the one who sleeps for a long time, deeply and easily and with much enjoyment. What was the conversation we had had the night before, on the car ride back? About our differences. Me saying, “I just don’t know what you mean when you say that we’re so different. I think our lifestyles are… amazingly compatible. ” It’s her turn to start talking in a way that turns to mumbling. Something, something… maybe, she says, it’s just that’s she’s afraid of feeling like this, and I’m not… but… us not being able to cook together? “Oh, forget it,” she said. “I love you,” and kissed me from the passenger’s seat. After waking up we don’t leave the bedroom for hours. We go to Seattle again; I’m trying once more to take us to karaoke. That won’t be happening for a while, though, so we’re in Capitol Hill eating sandwiches at a nice little place. Then we’re at a Starbucks, getting coffee, talking about her friends for an hour or so. Walking by, I notice the sign for Central Seattle Community College: “Does that say Crispin Glover’s going to be here? It’s in forty-five minutes. Want to go?” But first, seeing a nice cityscape, she leads us to the stop of some steps. We’re there for a bit. I’ve decided that I like Seattle a lot better with her around. Crispin Glover does his book-reading-slideshow, then shows his film It is fine. EVERYTHING IS FINE! We stop at a bar and grill in Des Moines. “Where are you from!” I guess they’re not used to strangers. One of the locals is talking to us—really to Arden, while I try unsuccessfully to get the twenty-five cent machine to give me pistachios. After the two of us have sat down with our beers and are waiting for food I say to her, “I can take you anywhere. It’s awesome. ” We talk again about wanting or not wanting to have children. She says, “I don’t think it’s strange that I would remember something like that—your saying that you’d like to have kids. ” I say, “Well, no, I don’t think it’s strange. I’ve just never really given the matter serious thought. I mean, I like kids. At the same time, I can see myself enjoying the freedom of not having them. ” Shortly before Crispin Glover’s slideshow had begun I had asked her, “Was there ever a point in your life when you did feel that you might want to have kids?” When she was with her old girlfriend, who had wanted to have children. Arden had thought that she might consider adopting with her. “I also like idea of being pregnant,” she adds. “I would be, like, a surrogate for a couple, if I could just turn over the child at the end of the nine months. ” We’re holding hands, seated in the theater, part of a crowd of art school types and young eccentrics. It was strange that I asked her that question—she had just had a dream, the night before, about having a child. In the dream she left the child with some people while she went somewhere else. Then someone told her, don’t you know? Those people aren’t going to give the child back. So the dream-Arden had to go back, trying to retrieve her child. There was a feeling in that, a feeling she hadn’t felt before. Something like what it must be like when you have a child. And then the dream went on… …but I didn’t get to hear about that. We set an alarm for three-something in the morning. I kind of rushed us out of the apartment before realizing that we had more time than I thought before her flight left. Up the winding concrete to the parking garage. We sat there talking. Again I don’t remember quite what. How is it that we live so far apart? But that was my doing. How strange that we live so far apart. How strange that we’re not together every day. How strange that it’s comfort and affection. Not an over-the-top passion. You can’t compare that sort of feeling to anything else. 77 I pick up Fiona in downtown Seattle after midnight. She’s another someone who’s been around the country but thinks she’ll end up back in New England. She has some MapQuest directions printed out to get us from her place of employment to Beth’s Café, a diner in Greenlake. It’s quiet at first, her in the passenger’s seat. We don’t see the diner on our first drive past, so then we’re stuck on the same long drive with no turnaround that I’ve been stuck on before. We circle back through the downtown, onto route 5 again. Finding a parking spot. It’s mostly me asking her questions. Silly questions or serious questions, the way I like to do it. At some point I get to rambling about myself, responding to her responses, and I’m puzzling over how I got caught up in thinking that what I did in life was just to ensure the bottom line of survival. “Well, as someone who’s been on the streets…” she’s saying. I’m nodding. I know, I know. She’s saying, “…and on drugs, I remember saying, ‘At least I haven’t hit rock bottom’…” I’m nodding. Yes, yes. Someone said to her, “Then just what would be rock bottom to you?” I say, “Yeah, it’s weird, the idea of rock bottom, it’s psychological…” One person’s rock bottom could seem like doing well to another person. Life just goes on and on. I’m saying, “I think it’s that I don’t want to give up. I don’t want to lose my hope and feel like it’s my fault that I’ve lost it. I don’t want to feel responsible for being in a situation where I don’t want to live anymore. ” Across the country, Arden is sleeping. Here, at Beth’s Café, there are pinball and arcade machines. (Since the visit this past weekend, Arden has been saying how happy she has felt, like the visit did something to cheer her up. “I want to be with you,” she communicated via text message. The insurance money from last summer’s car accident finally came in; my mother deposited it in my old bank account at Florence Savings Bank. ) Walking back to the car, I’m saying how I missed being jittery on caffeine like this at two in the morning. “We should definitely do this again,” says Fiona (although in actuality she never responds to my messages again). I drop her off at her place in Capitol Hill. I’m awake for most of the night, then, watching Muppet Show episodes rented through Netflix. 78 After she moved to the Southwest I sort of promised Marie that I would get around to visiting her there. But she also went and got pregnant—an event which, although it is great for her, would have prevented us from having our projected HookahFest. I was excited for that, too. She was going to upgrade her argila and we were going to smoke all sorts of flavored tobacco using it. Oh, but what I’ve chosen to do with my upcoming week of free time instead is understandable, I’d say. I’m fitting two different Northeast states into my itinerary—one so that I can see family and various friends there, another so that I can maybe see some different friends and so I can definitely see a certain someone. 79 Jan. 22. NPR this morning was all but assuring the end of civilization—fallen stock prices and all that. Yesterday, when I had first turned the radio on, it had been more optimistic, airing MLK-related stuff. I had chomped on french fries during my lunch break, foot up on the seat, in the car, listening. 80 At this mall thing in Federal Way, Washington. The cashier at Borders likes my new journal-book. Seeing the cover, which is an array of odd-looking illustrations of animals: “Is this a book?… It’s a journal!” “Yeah, plus it’s cheap,” I say, “A good find. ” “And it’s cool!” Thank you, spunky cashier. I’m not sure I really recall the last time I got to speak with an enthusiastic person. 81 The other soon-to-be-passengers know the boarding process well. I see them without guidance taking their shoes off, putting them in baskets, which then go along a conveyor belt. I ask a security-type person for instructions. Then I have to get through the metal detector thing and retrieve my bag and baskets of stuff on the other side. It’s all very hectic. I’m the slow one. Airports are weird. I guess it would be about eleven years now since the last time I flew on an airplane. It’s snowing outside, but lightly. Not sticking to the ground or anything. 82 After so long without flying, it was like a revelation. Other technologies don’t astound me as much as flight—I can kind of understand a computer, something like that, but to have these flying machines going all the time, so many of them, so reliably, with so few of them plummeting and killing all the passengers… I’ve got to hand it to modernity, that’s pretty tight. After a day without a cigarette, this morning I bought a pack. Hadn’t eaten much the day prior, hadn’t eaten today (and still haven’t) and the light-headedness was crazy. It felt like I was floating out of my body, but as I looked down I saw that I was walking as casually as I usually do. I met Arden’s new cat, Ted. Secret is still here, as well. After waking up for a bit and then taking another nap this morning I finally feel rested, like my brain can function. I feel rushed, squeezing so much into a week’s vacation, and already sad that I’ll be needing to go back to Washington. (“Welcome home,” Arden said as we got to her apartment. ) 83 Circumstances have changed somewhat in Alice’s life. Both the iguana and Marquis the cat have died. They have a different guest or two staying with them. On this day in particular there’s a photo shoot scheduled to take place down in the studio. After she gets P. down for a nap, we step out for a clove. We’re catching up. Two friends of hers stop by and we’re standing out there, talking and smoking. Arden arrives, then the other two leave, then we’re back inside. The gal who has been staying on the futon came with groceries, then left, then returned, finished putting away the groceries, napped, and awoke. Franklin returns from teaching, wearing his “Get a job!” shirt, which has, like, an illustration of a skeleton getting a blowjob. His mother has arrived and departed, taking with her a sleepy-turned-crying P. Franklin is feeling crappy, lies down for a rest. A couple of other folks who are involved with tonight’s shoot arrive. Arden and I make our exit as they’re about to head downstairs. I need to be sure that I’ll be able to get my laptop online in the morning; I’m scheduled to work for three hours. Arden says that there’s a box of routers and stuff at her work, she has the keys, so we’re at her workplace then. Inside the door, up a small stairway. A doorway to the next length of stairs. “They figured, ‘Why bother putting glass in the door?’” I inquire. Yeah, somebody punched that out. Here we go—light switch turning on—here’s the place. (So dirty, Arden says, but I don’t really see what’s so disgusting. ) There’s the desk she works at. “Oh, it actually looks organized right now,” she says. And here’s the box! Yes, this should work. Cables and everything. Do I want to see the warehouse? “This is my empire,” where all the supplies they sell are kept. “I bought most of this,” she says. Pushing a button to make the automatic door go up, she grabs and kisses me. This leads us to a deck area outside, nothing spectacular. Back to the car with the box we go. At home she’s hungry, so she cooks for us while I’m trying to set up a network on her computer. I don’t actually know what I’m doing. I give up after we’ve eaten all the food and we’re still drinking wine and this silly tinkering with computer stuff is cutting into our time together. I know that I’ll be able to wake up in the morning and, while she’s at work, get things to work somehow. Continuing wine consumption. I say that I think she and I, together, make sense. We’re both so independent, and maybe she’s been scared to make the love-leap while I haven’t been, but really… that makes me all the luckier to have her, I mean, sometimes it can be a bad thing being too ready to love and to let yourself be with somebody, but it really (here as I’m speaking to her, sitting on the living room floor, with wine in a glass in my hand, I’m speaking well and seriously and I think touchingly although I don’t express what I’m expressing through any clear sort of logic) it really is something that makes me trust her to know that she is not only independent but also looking out for my independence too, supporting it, so I can see us being together as really supporting, you know, furthering our… because we respect that about each other, and yeah I’m young and thank you for not being scared away by that and “It’s a good story,” I say, about our meeting and my moving away and then things progressing from there. “A good story?” “Well, not for my story. It’s a different story. It’s our story. ” And I think, then, about that statement. Intimate moments and in the morning I work, just plugged the plug from the cable modem into my laptop. Then I’m online and lying down with the cats occasionally and happy and when she gets back we’ve arranged to go to the American Star Diner, then catch a showing of the Sweeney Todd movie. I’m lying in her bed. She showers. We’re sitting in traffic, then we’re eating food. The waiter’s flirting with her. (And when we’re ready to leave, I say that I’m going to grab a smoke. I bum a match from someone at the counter, which is in the smoking section. Meanwhile, the waiter sees an in and chats her up, where do you live and what do you do?) “It’s all part of the adventure of leaving the house,” I say when she tells me this. We enjoy the film. Back at her place she asks, “Would you really move back here to be with me?” to which I respond, “Yeah. ” In the morning, once I’ve taken the R5 into Philly and have my bag and am ready to go, in Center City, another distinct and familiar universe. I have a classic exchange with a guy outside the Greyhound station—yeah I have a smoke. “The cops here are dicks,” he says, “I’m from New York,” spitting. He’s baby-faced. He asks, “I probably look like I’m eighteen, right?” I paused to consider, then just say, “You look young, yeah. ” He tells me that he’s twenty-three, but hasn’t had his I. D. so hasn’t been able to do anything. I’m not paying the best of attention to him, but he’s saying something about some girl, a girl saying that he’s got a boyfriend, and his saying, what’s her boyfriend got to do with him? And once you’re in a conversation with a character in front of a Greyhound station, other characters will always flock to you. In this case it’s just someone selling a rap CD, it’s his brother’s, five dollars. He leaves and I finish my cigarette. The guy who bummed a smoke is going to Lancaster to his mom’s. He’s saying something about how his brother murders people down here. Yeah, well, I’ve gotta get on my bus. On board, I have two seats to myself. TV screens are playing The Pursuit of Happyness, starring Will Smith. In New York at the Port Authority, I grab a slice of pizza. A sad-looking woman comes up to me as I’m eating and asks for a dollar. I say no and she leaves. I find a bus that’s leaving for Springfield an hour before the one I’m scheduled to take. I hand over my ticket and hop aboard. On I-95 in Connecticut we’re stuck in traffic for miles upon miles upon miles. "

    "body": "84 And now I’m departing from Massachusetts, looking at my shoes, which are falling apart. I should have better footwear for my first day at the new job. On a train this time, waiting patiently on platform 3 at the Springfield station. On Thursday, after being picked up at the Springfield bus terminal by my mother and Bruce, I was downstairs, where Memé and Pepé live. They were watching the debates between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the two candidates left into the Democratic primary race. “Have you been following this?” Memé asked me. “Yeah,” I said. “Oh, me too,” she said. Her voice clearly indicated that she has been enthralled by it. I never thought of my family as being political. I hardly ever recall hearing discussions of that sort of thing while I was growing up. Then again, maybe I just tuned it all out because I was too young to understand. I do remember my father watching debates, though. A Presidential election is a big something, something that nearly everyone has an opinion on, even if the person doesn’t vote. So I suppose this is the sort of time when everyone becomes political, to some extent. (I can’t believe how estranged I am from my father’s side of the family. All those people I may never see again… but what about when my grandmother dies? Or will I skip that too, like I skipped my grandfather’s funeral? I don’t even know everyone’s names on that side of the family, anymore. ) Life (as the sky has grown dark and I see the streetlights as speckles, the train moves along along the track and a whistle blows, it’s spacious in here because no one takes trains all that often anymore, but I wonder how many folks are still hopping on trains, finding somewhere to hide, taking a ride, that free but dangerous way to cover distance by land, it’s not something that I would ever do or recommend) continues and I have actually finally after all this time come to feel like an adult. I met Julian at CVS as he was ending his shift. He suggested that we eat and drink at the Toasted Owl, and for the first time I can remember, as I heard the name of that place, there appeared in my mind an image of an actual toasted owl. It’s a weird image. Try to form it for a second. Toasted owl. Owl, toasted. Like toasted ravioli, except you take out the ravioli and replace it with an owl. (I don’t know that I want to bother writing all the details of this brief stay in Massachusetts. ) We reach a train stop. Some people board. We travel further south, through Connecticut. Another stop. Some more people board. Every once i\n a while we pass an intersection, past flashing lights and stopped cars. It’s a different perspective, then—”Oh, I’m on the train and not in one of the automobiles!” My future feeling bright right now, but will it only be a short time until that changes? In Hartford the train gets more crowded. I was appreciating them, Julian and Salma. On Thursday night it was just me and Julian at the World War II Veterans’ Club (“The Deuce”) and after their trivia nights on Thursdays there is karaoke, so I sang “Bird on the Wire” by Leonard Cohen. The place is nicer than it used to be, with impressive ventilation for all the cigarette smoke. On Friday I worked in the spare room slash Alyssa’s room slash where I was sleeping when I was living there last. Then I met with Salma at Haymarket; I had coffee while she had food, the two of us sitting in the downstairs. I seem to be doing better than I was before, both Julian and Salma told me. My Memé thinks that Hillary Clinton would be the best choice for President. I asked Salma, how was Haris, how was Janelle, how was Wendy? She prompted me (as she seems to like to do) to talk about Arden. “Ah, love…” she would say. Then there was the Deuce again. Julian showed up, so it was me and him and Salma at a table. It was a good night. I sang “Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now” by The Smiths, “Nancy Boy” by Placebo, “At Seventeen” by Janis Ian, and “Welcome to the Black Parade” by My Chemical Romance. Then we all went to the Route 9 Diner. Everything was yay. In the morning I had to drive to Salma’s work in Hatfield, because I had left my journal in her car. At the Route 9 Diner Julian said, “Happy Groundhog Day!” and I said, “I hope I get to repeat it over and over like in the movie, Groundhog Day. That way, I get to see you guys, and I get to see Arden, again and again. ” That night at the Deuce, also Tina was there—still looking like herself, coming over and saying hi, singing No Doubt’s “Sunday Morning” and then off along with her roommate to an ’80s event somewhere. Salma had left a phone message for Lyric, but with no response. We had called Kelsey the night before, but she had been ready to go to sleep. And I’m thinking to myself… I’m seeing who’s left, who misses my being around now that I’ve left. It seems that I’m poised to return to Pennsylvania. A train ride, train ride, then… The last night and the last morning, “I love you,” “I love you,” between me and Arden, a wealth of good signs and kind signals. Always touching each other. Ted the cat always climbing up on us. I’m cranky in the morning prior to coffee—no surprise there—but Arden forgives. All too soon, it’s time for me to be dropped off at the airport and I go through security. This time aboard the plane I have a window seat, and even an empty seat next to me. This provides some consolation for the fact that I’m going back to Washington. Oh, but I can think of it as a sort of adventure, considering that I don’t plan to stay there—heyyy, it’s like a long vacation! I can continue to explore… but, I don’t know. It is what it is. All things considered, I take a look at my life as it is right now and I’m satisfied with it. After we’ve boarded the plane and moved away from the gate, information arrives that Chicago has limited the number of arrivals it can take. “It’s not that the weather there is bad,” the pilot says, sounding sort of annoyed, “We were just there. ” I’m a little bit wiser, now: in the future, I will try to avoid having airplane changeovers in places like Chicago during the winter. It’s great, this sudden revelation that I can fly in airplanes and get around so quickly. In New York I stepped off the train and walked out of Penn Station for a smoke. Have I been to NYC during winter before? I’m not sure, but I liked the feel of it. There wasn’t any snow or anything, just a man screaming, “They call me delusional? Everyone is delusional!” while I paced, glancing at billboards. I was getting used to life in cities. Maybe I could live in New York, after all. My Memé, while watching the debate, listened to Clinton say something along the lines of, “We have to be honest with ourselves; in communities where there’s a large number of illegal immigrants, because some businesses will exploit them, it does affect the ability of citizens to get work. ” “That’s right!” my Memé said, “The Puerto Ricans. They get everything!” Such is the world of politics. The Senator says something quite different from what my Memé takes it to mean… but benefits from that misinterpretation. It intrigues me, this multi-dimensional quality of rhetoric; speaking to a non-specialized audience, an entire populace who needs to get the impression that you’re distinct from them, more qualified than they ever could be. I will never be a politician, we can be quite certain… but this type of observation can help a writer, as well. Apparently, it wasn’t just my mother who read my story “The Curmudgeon”. Little Katie read it aloud. Yes, and so Katie was trying to get me to explain the story in terms that she would understand. Being unprepared, I did not succeed. At our cruising altitude, heading west, high clouds drifting like powdery snow… yes, look at that… clouds below, clouds above, clouds at our level. Even before I was born, my parents could get themselves on a commercial airline flight and there’s the nose pointing upwards and the nervousness, turning, tilting one way, the reflecting sun, so we could take this flight for granted and you see the stock footage in television series. So I think about flight. I think about how we’re able to fly higher than birds. Space travel, time travel, I’m not even going to think of those right now. The accomplishment of this sort of flight alone is so remarkable. It really starts to occur to me that I am glad to inhabit a world in which knowledge is so available—so available that we are able to make technologies like these. I really start to wonder what else what might be invented, what might I invent if I set my mind to it? (Although, it’s a knife that cuts both ways when angels talk to you. It feels like you’re important, getting messages from another point in time, but then it’s like you’re sucked into another possibility, doing something for somebody just because they want you to and because they’re rich in some future economy or whatever. ) I am finally, honestly just starting to feel confident that I might be able to figure out how to do this “survive in the twenty-first century” thing. We’re at our cruising altitude. It’s a two hour flight to Chicago. I’m stuck at O’Hare in Chicago—snow falling all over the planes and runway—during the Super Bowl. So I sit and mind my own business while other people are watching the televisions and screaming. It’s hard to be as sour as I probably would otherwise be about this wait, when all these people are having such a good time of their snowed-in Sunday evening. We eventually board the plane and wait for de-icing. Twice so far I have used someone else’s cell phone to call Zella and give her an estimated time for my arrival at the Sea-Tac Airport. Once again I have a window seat, and an empty seat next to me. The certified de-icers show up eventually. Fluid is sprayed, a solution made to get rid of the existing ice and to prevent more from gathering. Then we’re ready to go. Flying through the air with the greatest of ease! Although, of course, after the first twenty seconds there is nothing more to see out the window other than gray, which quickly becomes black. Having a hunger, I’m happy when the beverage cart comes around. I get the three dollar can of Pringles-style potato chips and a five dollar 187ml bottle of Shiraz. Above all else, I took from this trip a very real sense (as well as verbal confirmation) that I do in fact have a lover who lives on the other side of the country. And it is full speed ahead, although it will still be some time before I have the option of moving to where she is. And this does feel fundamentally different from my past… oh, you know… relationship-things. It’s been sort of a sore spot for me that after all these years, when I look back, none of those connections really look serious. The emotions were serious, and my journals make certain that the older me does not forget what that all was like… but for the most part, I’ve never been one to have a partner. I’m all sorts of ready for this change of pace, especially as it feels like what I’ve been waiting for, a sort of validation of my choice to keep-—what was it that Lyric, earlier this year, accused me of doing?—”waiting for the perfect partner”. No, not perfect. Just loving, honest, fun, and evolved enough to not be hung up too much on the roles we’re expected to be playing, what we’re supposed to be because we look male or female. Someone who looks me in the eye and just feels right. I drink the wine slowly. (The plane ride will take us something like four hours. ) Then I spill the wine on myself, my books, the tray table, and to a lesser extent the seat. I sit still, polite and proper, until I can ask a flight attendant for napkins. By the time I arrive in Seattle my ass is sore like nobody’s business. I hate sitting like a normal human being for longer than ten minutes, let alone for four hours at a stretch. It’s 1:30 in the morning. I borrow a cell phone to call Zella, who is asleep and incoherent. I squat outside with my notebook and write. 85 And after my first week at the new job I spend Saturday morning pretty much just hanging out on the Internet and reading politics. My paycheck from the old job arrives and it’s short a bunch of money. Why doesn’t that surprise me? And I’m feeling stumped about what to do with my free time. Zella is still hiding away in her room. We’ll talk for a short while sometimes if, say, she’s come home from work and I’m in the living room with my computer. She’ll say something like, “Life is crazy,” before returning to her sanctuary. Having three days off, I think about taking a drive to somewhere… but nowhere seems worth a trip. I’ve bought tickets for some concerts coming up, so that’s good. But there’s also still the long-term question: is there something more that I would like to do with my life? Something to which I would like to apply my talents and intellect? Nothing jumps out at me right now. I could write fiction, but there’s also something very painful about inventing human beings when I feel like I should be having meaningful interactions with real ones instead. 86 For Valentine’s Day Arden sent me a mix CD and a card. That was nice of her. I considered lots of things to send her, of course, but only sent an OKCupid message. (Three lines long, which took me about an hour and a half to write. ) For most of my shift at work I forgot what day it was. I sat in my cubicle, pointing and clicking to input the data from nurses’ itineraries, all the while eavesdropping on the conversations of my co-workers. 87 “What’s that strange glowing orb in the sky?” I’ve heard more than one person joke on sunny days. Lately, the sun has been out quite a bit. It’s February, but the temperature has been in the fifties. It feels as though Autumn has ended and it’s finally time for spring. I recently hung out with Rinya, someone I’ve been chatting with online, and her husband and some of her friends at a pool place in Capitol Hill. It seemed to go pretty well. We moved on to a bar where some guys dressed as superheroes played rock music onstage. Today is Sunday. I’m depressed. I cleaned a bunch, but that didn’t seem to help. I haven’t seen Zella for, like, a couple of weeks. I don’t know what’s going on with her. 88 In addition to the 40 hours doing data entry at Providence Hospice I’ve been working three three-hour remote shifts per week at the answering service. I should email Mike, though, and say that I don’t want to do Mondays anymore. Right now it’s 5:45 AM on Monday and I still haven’t fallen asleep. I’m supposed to log on and start taking calls at 7:00. "

    "body": "89 All day I handle information about people who are expected to die soon or who have recently died. Sometimes I have their stories in my hands. It makes me happy more than sad, usually, because so many of the people are so old. It’s like… you were born in 1911? And you’re going to die in 2008? Seriously? That lifespan alone—so many decades through this changing world—would make the most boring person’s life an interesting story. Imagine being a teenager in the 1920s and then living to see today. Maybe you can’t process it all in your old age, but the glimpses you catch of the commercials and the fashions and the music and the growth and the politics—that’s some Buck Rogers shit right there! If you live to be old enough you grow more and more alien. Maybe then you see how much power you had… how much you and your peers created your own reality… and how quickly and easily reality is inevitably overthrown. 90 Becoming a grown up to me is an experience of knowing that there is worse, knowing that there is better. Knowing that the future may be better, or that it may be worse. It’s the second greatest shock of my life to feel like a normal person. Not normal in personality or experience or beliefs, but in participation in society. But no, on second thought, I still don’t really have that normalcy. I’m just making ends meet, and shocked by that. I told my mother on the phone that I spent all my time working and trying to sleep. She told me that’s all there really is. 91 In my room, on my mattress, messes of paper and dirty clothes on either side of me. Oh, the thin walls. Zella is having a guest stay over for a couple of days; I hear this guest, a nineteen-year-old, when she clears her throat or whatever in Zella’s room. I also hear Zella in the living room. She’s on the phone with someone, telling the story of how Lydia was recently suggesting that she move to New Orleans, something gnostic something mystic sex, sounds fun. I’ve just wrapped up a couple of conversations myself—one on the phone with Salma and one on the Internet with Tonya, who is apparently talking to me again. She was dating someone for a couple months, but he broke it off tonight. (Life is too short to be too offended about things like that, I’ve decided by now. ) I was supposed to meet Rinya and her husband for an open mic tonight… but after I worked in the living room this morning I fell asleep and slept through the alarm I had set to wake me up at 2 in the afternoon. I slept until about 7:00 at night. Yeah. 92 The world outside of America seems pretty shocked that we’d like a Black guy as a candidate for President. And a woman, too, yeah, it’s about time, but a Black guy! Apparently they’ve heard about that whole slave trade, legacy of oppression thing. I do think that a woman nominee is less likely to be elected as President, though. Especially Hillary. If we’re all a little bit racist, then we’re all really sexist. And as women come, they don’t get much more demonized than her. This is an election for the history books, in any case. (Never mind that the chapter will begin with the words, “As the U. S. began to lose its clout internationally…”) 93 Watch me put on my rubber thumb to quickly flip through papers. I affix labels with patient information on them. Watch me again carry stacks to the copier. The Space Needle, taller than everything else. Hills go up in the distance. A view from the third floor. In the elevator, someone who is apparently my co-worker: “How long have you been here now? A month?” “About six weeks, yeah. ” “How’s it going?” “Pretty well. ” “A lot to remember, huh?” “Well…” I shrug, threatening to think. You shouldn’t think during elevator talk. She says, “Well, you’re young. Take care of that brain,” or something like that. I walk to the deli for lunch. 94 In the morning I drive to Seattle, park the car in a garage, carry a small duffel bag and my laptop to Pier 69 and catch the ferry to Victoria, British Columbia. The last time I was on a boat was probably either that whale-watching trip when I was in the sixth grade or one of those times when I camped with my father in Canada and took ferries to and from Quebec City. It’s cloudy, a little past sunrise. Outside was a typical drizzle, the sort of light ongoing spray that I’ve become so familiar with. It doesn’t get you wet, really. That’s one thing I’ve noticed about the rainy season here—for all the rainy days you get, you’re less likely to be soaked when you walk outside than in other parts of the country. “The northbound traffic lanes of the Puget Sound” is where the captain (or whatever) says we are. This, we are told, is expected to be the comfortable part of the trip. When we get to the Strait of Juan de Fuca we will all be thrown around like rag dolls, the way he makes it sound. Since coming aboard I’ve been experiencing allergy-like symptoms. I sneeze several times and a boy somewhere else on the ferry mimics: “Ah-choo!” I smile and look out the window. Maybe the symptoms are some weird unconscious, psychosomatic thing, since I checked the weather online today and saw a high pollen alert for Seattle. Am I even allergic to pollen? I don’t know. For most of my life I’ve taken the attitude that hey, sometimes I’m sneezing a lot, sometimes I get a sore throat or whatever… if it isn’t disabling then okay, I won’t think about it too much. But it doesn’t feel like I’m coming down with a cold or anything. As the ride progresses it’s as though from the outskirts of Mist-land we have gone deeper and deeper in. It gets to looking at points like the view from an airplane before it finds a cruising altitude. (I am less afraid of drowning than of plummeting great distances through the sky, however; call it a matter personal taste. ) Actually, death has been on my radar a lot. I haven’t been thinking overly much about it, really, but work at the answering service was of course how it started. Recently, I answered a line: “Thank you for calling, law offices. ” “My grandma is dead!” screamed a little girl. “Are you trying to reach a law office? You’ve reached a law office. ” “No!” she screamed, “My grandmother was in a car accident and she’s dead!” “Is this something… have you called 911? Or are you trying to reach someone in particular?” “What?” Click. Then another line is ringing; someone in Texas is looking for wood flooring. And working for a hospice provider, now, death is something that the nurses I work with all see constantly. On Saturdays one of the things I do is print out and fill in paperwork to get rented equipment picked up from the residences of patients who have died since the previous night. (The up and down of the ferry boat is now not unlike that of a kiddie roller coaster. I kind of like it. Whee!) (More like a grown-up roller coaster, now. This is awesome!) 95 Victoria, British Columbia. Everything is happier in Canada! The only possible exception for me being customs and immigration: they asked me lots of questions, went through my stuff, and swabbed my identification for traces of narcotics. It’s a reasonably nice day right now. I’m waiting for the van that will take me to my hotel. Then I’ll be meeting Kristi. 96 Hey, there’s Kristi. We say hi. We talk about her work a little. She’s saying that yeah, she’s pretty lucky to have a good job straight out of university, one for which she moved here from Toronto, this being a place she likes and Toronto not so much. She owns a condo now, and she just took the job a year and a half ago. This is us sitting at a coffee shop on Douglas Street. Already, before her arrival, I’ve gone through a copy of a local newspaper that was sitting around. She asks me what I’m doing for work. I explain. I am generally embarrassed when I explain to people what I’m doing for work, nowadays, although at the same time it is by far the best arrangement I have ever had. 97 And after Kristi and I have wandered downtown we stop to eat. I ask for no mayo on my veggie burger, but mayo gets put on it anyway. Then I accidentally initiate a conversation about health care. “I just don’t understand why anyone would not want a system guaranteed by the government,” Kristi says, “And the politicians who are talking about universal coverage in the U. S. now… they’re not talking about what the rest of the world means when they talk about universal coverage. ” I try to explain the rationale of people who want a private system of insurance. Unfortunately (and this is no big surprise) in describing it to a Canadian it just sounds like smoke and mirrors around a system that allows the rich to get obscenely more rich while the poor work harder and benefit less from society. “The idea,” I say, “Is that competition gives incentive to improve quality. ” And I think, But isn’t it silliness beyond all believability to equate the quality of health service with competition among insurance companies? Insurance companies fill a need that wouldn’t even exist under a system that didn’t decrease the accessibility of services over time. “And insurance companies are pretty powerful,” I say, “So it’s hard to imagine them being made to just go away. ” It can of course seem like greed and opportunism are the only qualities the U. S. rewards. If we’re smart and hard-working, maybe we can get a primary care physician, but that might change at any time. The amount of effort one consistently needs to put forth in order to feel secure… and then that security is so often just an illusion. There’s always a bubble bursting. Me and my zany adventures, distractions, travels and night life, who am I to complain? But when the “smart” people according to the definitions of the time and place in which I live are the people who invent ways to profit on what was unprofitable before, to shove middlemen into industries where they have never before been necessary… We stare at charts and graphs of the United States and appraise ourselves according to them. Meanwhile, public education teaches us to abandon hope more than anything else. And at the university level, anyone who acts like they’re putting in effort gets an ‘A’ for the price of ten, twenty, forty thousand dollars a year… and passionate and internally motivated people work in service and retail positions at Wal-Mart and Pizza Hut, working harder and harder, lucky to get enough overtime to afford renting a room. So it can seem, yeah, like you’re either a sucker or a scam artist. When society rewards salesmanship above all else, it sets us all against each other. And when we’re set against each other, all we create with our labor is new problems for which to sell solutions. It is in no one’s particular self-interest to analyze the system. Anyway. Kristi and I parted ways, then. I went back to my hotel room and slept. Then I woke up, tried to go to karaoke at the local gay bar, but discovered that I had forgotten what night of the week it was. It was actually drag night, and there were only like fifteen people in the place. A guy was talking to me and touching my arm before I even had my drink. I gulped down the glass of wine, finishing after the one performance had finished and a twenty minute intermission had begun. On a cigarette break outside of the Traveler’s Inn (which appears to own the town: they’re everywhere) I noticed a karaoke bar right next door. But the doors were locked; they stop letting people in at midnight on Sundays. 98 1: Why are you in Canada? 2: Hey! Long time, no hear. 1: Has it been? The last was in December, right? 2: December of what year? 1: You’re joking, right? The record shows an average of almost five interviews per year. 2: I just mean, I thought the last was more recent than December. 1: Definitely December, 2007. That’s true in your memory, too, right? You want us to be sure of us. 2: Yes. Yes, that’s accurate. 1: This interview will be a quick one, by the way. I just wanted to present an idea to you. 2: Go for it. 1: Do you think it’s important that you factor the opinion of a hypothetical, judgmental external observer into so many of the decisions you make? And do you imagine that this relates to your sort of being raised Catholic? Your father in particular drilled into you the impression of a god who was like Santa Claus, who would see you when you were sleeping and know when you were awake. 2: Yeah. Yeah, that’s a good question. You’re coming out swinging this time! I guess it’s really ingrained in me at this point that the purpose of life is “to be a good person”, but also that the definition of a good person is an unknowable thing. So I’m sparing in my intentionality, because I don’t know what I’m likely to be punished or rewarded for… I just know that I’m expecting consequences. 1: And that spare intentionality annoys some people. Does it bother you when people dislike you? 2: People don’t dislike me for trying to be a good person, though. When they dislike me it’s because it’s hard to trust someone who only believes tactically. It’s anti-social, in a way, when you might just suddenly say, “Oh! I’m taking my life in a new direction now. But not in a way that aligns with what anyone around me would have me do. ” 1: And then they might give up on you. So you’re not so public about writing out your brain anymore, not the way you used to be when you were writing on LiveJournal, and before that on your personal web site. 2: And it feels like nothing’s happening now. 1: Yeah? 2: Yeah. So, I’m in Canada now just to be somewhere different. I’ve been bored, so it’s good to find some newness. This is the fourth province I’ve been to. 1: Going to start counting Canadian provinces now that you’re nearly out of states you haven’t been to? 2: Nah. But I could complete my collection of states by the end of the year if I really wanted to. 1: Congratulations. How does that feel? 2: Stupid, actually. I like to travel, but it shouldn’t be a goal of mine. The more in control of my own life I get, the more I would rather help other people. 1: But then you spend your money like this, just to be somewhere else. 2: It’s true… 99 In the morning I called out of work (the Internet kept disconnecting and there was no way I was going to be able to do my shift from the hotel room) and slept some more. Then I had to check out. I left my bags under the watchful eye of the hotel staff and wandered around town. My side was hurting, I thought probably because the pants I was wearing were too tight. So when I went back at the hotel to get my things I changed my pants in the bathroom. 100 Once I’m back in Seattle I call Arden. When I’m on the off-ramp from 167 into Kent I ask, “Is there anything you wanted to talk about?” She says no. “Okay,” I say, “You feel like things are good with us?” She: “Yes. ” Me: “Me, too. ” She: “(Pause) Yeah?” Me: “Yeah. You sound like you’re surprised. ” She says, she says something, but I’m driving, still, and can’t quite hear every word. Something about a part of me, it’s hard to explain, but it feels like it’s hard to know where it will go… it’s hard to hold onto. This is the start of our more serious conversation. She feels a little bit like she could be just anyone. She’s feeling like what excites me is less her and more what I’m able to get from her—the feelings of comfort, the potential for a relationship. It’s a long talk we have, and my summary will of course be flawed, but I’m saying (at the apartment, on my living room floor, not processing the return home from another country because I’m immersed in the conversation) that to me—”what I bring to this”—is that when I hear what she has to say about this and I apply it to my observations, what I think she’s addressing looks to me like a subtle difference. “And of course,” I tell her, “That subtlety is just my view of what I think you’re expressing. And because you have these feelings when you look at that difference in how each of us views going into a relationship—because to you it looks like that’s big and may be something to worry about, the matter overall isn’t small… but I do want to say that that’s how I see our difference. And I want to figure out why we see this thing differently. Is one of us just wrong, and it’s bigger than I think or smaller than you think? Probably both, I guess. ” Ending in a lighter turn of voice, not wanting her to feel pressured to respond to anything I’ve said. Arden is more sensitive than she usually lets on. I’m glad that she wants to talk instead of leaving her worries inside… and I’m glad that she likes when we talk like this. And I’m glad my somewhat hyper-precise way of talking about relationship things doesn’t put her off. And I hope I can learn and I hope that we can be together. I think our talks are helping us both to know what we’re getting into… …even if I do see our relationship as something that I’m happily dedicated to, while she sees it more as something that she’s happily overwhelmed in the discovery of. On the living room floor, still, after our conversation is over, I start watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I like it better than I remembered. "

    "body": "101 Kent, Washington. And it seems that this may be the beginning of the end for my time in this state. I have been lately logging back into my student account at Johns Hopkins… reconsidering, yes, and armed with a little more confidence in my ingenuity. Registration for summer courses begins tomorrow. Zella comes home this afternoon wearing a really nice, thin leather jacket over a bright red and black outfit. I’m sitting on the living room floor. It’s Easter, and since waking up I’ve chatted online with Arden, driven to McDonald’s for coffee and food, talked to my mom and cousin Ken and aunt Brenda on the phone (since they’re all assembled for the holiday, out there), talked to Arden on the phone… and I’m thinking, actually, that I want to consider the logistics of a possible move before the end of this lease. Zella plops herself down on the living room floor. (Usually she just darts from the door to her room, but sometimes she doesn’t. ) She asks me how Canada was, and I kind of shrug. I ask her about her trip to San Francisco. She says she had a great time, although it involved her driving for more than twenty hours without sleeping, through inclement weather. She talks about her car breaking down on St. Patrick’s Day. She shows me the additional work that she got done to the tattoos on her arms. She says that her next move is going to be to there. She has someone up here who wants to share her room for the next couple of months and then take it over at the end of May. So how about this, then—I move in with Arden at the end of May, try traveling to Baltimore one day a week for class, then I play it by ear as far as what to do next? I would have the answering service gig to start with, since I can do that remotely from anywhere. And if living together with Arden didn’t work out for any reason I wouldn’t feel stranded, and I would still know that I was on that side of the country for a good reason. 102 Before going to sleep last night I told Arden that I think I might be out there in late May. She has been expressing her excitement since. I’m excited, as well… but I also have a cold. Sneezing, stuffy nose, sore throat. I started to feel it on Saturday, when about seven of the eight hours I worked were worked alone, just me sniffling while sorting paperwork. Then this morning (Monday) it was clear to me from the state of my voice as I answered phone calls. And I had thought myself pretty sure that it wasn’t going to get any worse… I fell asleep in the afternoon after running errands, which included paying $325 in use tax to register my vehicle in the state of Washington. Then I ran off to the Shari’s Restaurant to eat. That’s where I am now, lingering, reading, having a sundae. 103 After another three-hour morning work shift from my living room and another unsuccessful attempt at taking a nap before I leave for my real job, I’m in my car and pulling into the Wendy’s parking lot. My phone rings. It’s Grace: “Hey, I need to have a meeting with you today. Could you come in a little early, maybe 11:30 instead of 12?” It’s presently 11:20. “Well, I’m on my way already,” I say, “But I won’t be able to make it there any earlier than usual. ” By that I of course mean that I expect to be late. Hm, I think to myself, I wonder if I’m getting scolded for something. Nah, I doubt it. But maybe it’s time to let me go. Maybe word came from up on high to let go of some of the temps. In her office. Ah, it’s a teleconference. Elaine, another employee who inputs itineraries, is there as well. Training on the new system, although we don’t start using the software until August. August? In my mind I’m not even planning to stay until August. Leaving in mid-May… it feels like that’s been the plan forever… although it’s probably only been two weeks since I made that decision. In an uncomfortable chair I keep almost falling asleep, my eyes rolling to the back of my head. Grace—the woman who hired me after an interview which at the time I had thought was sort of pathetic on my end—is now punching me in the arm when I start to nod off. “When did you get to sleep last night?” “Uh…” I try to remember the time and duration of my most recent instances of sleep. Didn’t I sleep for like twenty minutes, wake up for a few hours, then sleep for… maybe another two hours? Then I did the work from home and failed in my attempts to nap. “I don’t remember,” I say. The teleconference ends mercifully ahead of schedule. Grace gives me the news that a decree from the gods of Mount Olympus has created two full-time, permanent openings for doing what I do now, only using the new software once the transition is made. Elaine and I are the chosen ones, the supreme point-and-clickers. And she says, you know how I hired you at more than this type of position would usually pay, to compensate for the lack of benefits? Well, it would be that same rate of pay, only with full benefits. And so there I was, an exhausted and falling asleep mess, being offered a pretty darn sweet deal. I thanked her and said that I would get back to her on Friday. Over the course of the day it starts to seem like too good an offer to pass up. I could still leave the apartment in May but move into Seattle itself and see if that wouldn’t serve me better than residing in an outlying city whose name, when mentioned, no one in the region is sure how to react politely to. But of course, it’s not as simple as that. Haven’t I been anxious to leave here, although this has been my job and this has been my income? Why does the word “permanent” and the offer of benefits appeal so strongly to me? (Insert many valid reasons here. ) It feels like a glut of opportunities, now. News stories make it sound like the economy’s going to send us all into shantytowns, but all I see are opportunities, beckoning me away from opportunities beckoning. I get home from work and at one o’clock in the morning am still awake. The two job thing has been hard on me. I haven’t written about actually hanging out with Tonya in Olympia again… or what I’m sure have been numerous poetic moments I would have liked to set down on paper, moments maybe taking place walking around the block on a break from work… I haven’t written about the web scripting I’ve been teaching myself… 104 Apr. 5, 2008. 9 PM. Seattle, Washington. Oh, good. I’ve found something that feels like a coffee shop. I think Seattle is warming up to me. I skipped lunch today to spend my half-hour break driving to the area of one of the apartment listings I had replied to on Craigslist. This involved my figuring out a little bit of how to get around in this city, taking me from where I work to Capitol Hill. (Until now my impulses to stick around in Seattle after work have usually been vetoed by the part of my brain that remembers how ill-fated have been most of my attempts to do anything here. ) But, yeah. This place is called, I think, The Victrola? It’s on 15th. Oh! I just looked at my coffee mug. Yeah, that’s what it’s called. And this is the start to a legitimate weekend for me—two days in a row without work obligations. I am very excited. And it has been an interesting week in my head, stuck in a cube in front of a computer and pondering yet another sudden shift in what I think I’m doing in my life in my near future. Julian says he’s moving to Indiana to live with the woman she has been seeing there. He has been periodically taking trips out there by means of Skybus, an extremely low-cost airline flying out of unusual airports including Westover Air Force Base in Chicopee, Massachusetts… but that airline shut down today, according to his text message. The intended heir to Zella’s part of the lease has been staying in her room. Other people come and go now, but I barely catch any real glimpses of them. It’s like they’re just spirits tramping through the house to remind me that the end is near and that I need to be getting ready to move. Let’s take a deep breath and again, as always, roll with and in and around and among the change. Previous generations referred to it as “progress”, but maybe more of us are learning now that that’s just a sales pitch. Change is change, another quarter in the crane machine, another adjustment of that stuffed animal so that you’re a little closer now, a little closer to getting that prize for your sweetie. Change is opportunity, and this is the land of opportunity: this is the land of change. I’ve been caught so off-guard by the good news of my being offered a permanent position. It’s bad news that I was prepared for—so many of those contingencies I was waiting to see myself faced with. But something so simple—and I think the involvement of the word “permanent” is what makes me unable to say no—something so simple as an offer of insurance and paid vacation and a chance not to worry about what kinds of shitty jobs I might have to work in the near future is enough to derail the returning-to-my-lover narrative. But when my heart and mind turn to what I’m failing to run to here, it’s like, how could I be so stupid? And I don’t know. I also don’t know how I could be so stupid as to not go and be with Arden. Someone Arden knew in Brooklyn just died. Arden texted me about it, saying that she was on her way to take care of Diane, whose friend it was. This was just after Grace had come to my cube asking: “Yes or no?” To which I had replied: “Yes. ” I don’t really have any idea what I’m going to say to Arden about this. Couldn’t I have not made this so emotional, if there remained some chance that I would not want to head back to the east coast? But again, this is a surprise to me. I didn’t think there was anything for me out here that I’d stay for. 105 Since moving away from Massachusetts thirteen months ago I have been actively trying to get to a karaoke night somewhere else, anywhere else. I have made attempts in Philadelphia, Seattle, Olympia, and Victoria. The sheer number of times I have been thwarted because I couldn’t find the bar, or because I had forgotten what day of the week it was, or because a companion changed their mind about what they wanted to do that evening, had passed the point of being amusing and was beginning to seem like a pointed message from the gods. Until tonight. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Seattle is the city that finally relented. Tonight I found with relative ease a location at which to sing along to pre-recorded instrument tracks in the style of popular artists. I went there by my lonesome, had a couple of drinks, and sang “Everybody Knows” by Leonard Cohen. I am glad for this. Sure, the much-fabled “Seattle Freeze” may mean that meeting people is a slower than usual process… but if I can’t talk to strangers I will sing to them. This city will know my voice! 106 “I don’t know if you remember… some months ago, we were talking about the idea of us being together, and I was saying how, with your being out there, we didn’t have the chance to just spend a lot of time hanging out together and see if things come together naturally. And you said, ‘Well, do things always have to be easy?’ and I felt like saying, ‘Yes! Why can’t things be easy?’” This is Arden on the phone with me, from her bed in North Wales, Pennsylvania. We’re finally having the conversation during which I tell her about the job offer. She continues: “…but with you, the way I feel about you and about having you around, it’s worth it in this case. ” I tell her that there’s a part of me that’s sort of angry with myself for being so tempted by this job. “No, you shouldn’t be angry at yourself,” she says, saying that she understands. At one point I go on, talking—talking to think—and it goes something like this: “A week ago, I felt like I knew that even if I went out there and you said, ‘Ha ha! Just kidding!’ I would still feel like, well, okay, but I wanted to come back to the east coast anyway, this is still what I wanted to do. And now… now it doesn’t feel like that, because I would rather be alone out here under these circumstances than alone out there. ” And then, in talking, it occurs to me: “I guess it’s a fear that you wouldn’t actually want to be with me. And before I didn’t feel like I had to face that fear, because I’d be doing what I thought was best either way. And now… now, I don’t know, is that what it is? Am I so scared that you won’t really want to be with me that I’m not going to give you a chance?” Ending on that sort of rhetorical question didn’t leave her much to respond to. In any case, the conversation continued… …and by the end, I just wanted to be up and leaving to be back with her again. 107 I call her after work on Wednesday (April 9) and tell her that I’ve decided I’ll be moving back out there. 108 And then Portland again. The drive seems to go quickly; normally I like making little stops when I’m driving a ways away, but this time I don’t pull off to hit a convenience store until Vancouver, Washington. Along the drive down I-5 it’s all O Northwest, O Northwest, the way my mind tries to come up with ways that I might describe this and that to the people who haven’t been here. Of course, as the rainy season has slowly been letting up (and as leaving the region has become a real possibility) I’m back to feeling the urge to keep myself planted firmly out here: Don’t make me go back to those dirty east coast cities, where it’s always too hot or too cold and everyone’s a dick to everyone else! In Portland I find my way to Bluejay’s place. Their pugs jump about all over me. We go out to eat at a dog-friendly place (although I’m the only one who’s eating) and then it’s onward to the Roseland Theater for the Cat Power show. Portland people everywhere makes me want to move here instead. This is to be expected. After the show we go out to eat at a bar/restaurant. The bartender is being filmed for a brief scene in somebody’s documentary. As we’re paying he’s singing along to “I Must Belong Somewhere” by Bright Eyes. 109 Rocco’s Pizza, Portland, Oregon. I slept on a couch at Bluejay and Rob’s place. Now I’m here grabbing some food. Ugh, I don’t know. Pennsylvania, huh? 110 Coffee Time, Portland, Oregon. But I already wrote it all the last time I was here, so… you know. There’s a sentimental attachment that I have to this town. One thing I do know from going through all those old journals is that abandoning Portland back in ‘01 was something I came to feel had been the wrong move. Does that tell me anything about my situation now? Maybe, or maybe not. In any case, my recent inspiration, my putting up archives to my web site, and my general sense that I can and should get into and try to get out there artistic endeavors… those are good. That’s where I want to be. I was thinking of it before… thinking that Portland could be the next place I move to, after the Seattle area. And now… well, I’ve let work know that I was declining that permanent position, but I didn’t say anything about leaving in the near future. I started trying to tell Bluejay about my feeling torn, while we were sitting inside the music venue and waiting for the show to start. I wasn’t sure how interested they were in hearing about it. They were online using their Sidekick. What, do I think I would never make friends in Seattle? No. Turning down the opportunity to be with Arden, it’s like… am I going to be that person who chooses all that other stuff over a relationship that seems like it could work out? But really, no one else but me would really be likely to see it in those terms. Probably, most people would see it as something that understandably, neither side would be willing to make work, because it involves moving across the country and that’s a big sacrifice to make. But in my case, a move across the country is not something that I’m generally, uh, difficult to convince is an appealing idea. But, then again, that’s also because I’ve been desperate for about a decade now in attempting to be a grown-up who doesn’t have to rely on family to pay for his needs. What about that school stuff? Johns Hopkins? Eh, you know. Sure, maybe that’d be a good idea! Or maybe it’s a terrible idea! I’m such a wishy-washy Charlie Brown. 111 The Victrola, Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington. To Arden, texting: “This week has been like a fever dream. ” So little sleep. And really my mind has been these coexisting flashes (and tics, the eye twitches, these things return) and since on Tuesday the work week began for me it’s been idea idea idea and “I’ll get around to (and the everything keeps changing) thinking about that, and boy I can’t wait until I can (Arden is in Maine for a pleasure trip to see her) think about that (friends) and maybe (The rising price of gasoline. I would rather, have always wanted to be someone who outsmarted the course of history. It would be, I mean, it just seems very unlikely that this age of plenty in America will not face, is not in a way due for, some tempest and tumult. I’ve often thought, “Let me be the one who fled, who prepared, who saw the signs and chose a path [not placated, not shrugging off the politics of the day, not tipping back another bottle and borrowing another friend’s Playstation game but looking around and surveying—I want to have faith in this ingenuity and whatnot our people supposedly have but I just don’t see it] which circumnavigated the the traps I’m so afraid of traps. And slaps. And slaps when I’m trapped. And the certainty of God in the murderous eyes of every angry man—that faith, which religion both organizes and makes conventional, a cultural norm. ) I should be asking myself, really, what would the purpose be of my pursuing any higher level of education? So it comes to this and I look at myself and I am not feeling like an anxious mess, just like someone who does not get a healthy amount of sleep. Pennsylvania holds its primary elections on my birthday, Tuesday, three days from now, when I will be turning twenty-seven. Only twenty-seven? But I would be lying if I said that this year didn’t seem to pass by quickly. And it was ten years ago, now, that I was in my first semester of college. Ten years ago, I remember standing out in the rain at Holyoke Community College on one of those days when I just didn’t feel like going home. And there was the girl from one of my classes who asked me, “Why are you standing around in the rain?” and I said that I didn’t mind it. But, no. That memory’s a lie, because I remember sitting on the steps with her as she talked to me. And it seemed odd behavior for someone to see me like that and have a reaction of wanting to know whether I was all right… and wanting to talk to me. The memories will only get more muddled and uncertain as I age, now. Congratulations! Getting older. But I love it. I love it because I’m the same person I was at seventeen, only the world sees me differently. There was nothing that a seventeen-year-old could say to get the level of respect that I can get now. And I’ve collected experience, which I can put on resumés and relate to new acquaintances through anecdotes. It’s like I have so many more keys now. And you may have noticed, if you’ve been paying attention to me and my life… I collect those keys, hoard them. In case of emergency I have a hundred identities behind breakable glass. I’m almost finished with my second cup of coffee. (The first refill is free. ) I suppose I’ll get going, but I also think… well… to what extent should I be afraid of money matters? To what extent should I be afraid of being in debt? But I may be overdue in beginning to pursue in a different and more pragmatic fashion what has been, since my early childhood, what I’ve always wanted to be, and what I’ve pretty much most of the time considered myself to be, regardless of what the outside world might think—a writer. So far I’ve not really been a writer. I’ve been a selective typist… a transcriptionist. A photographer of spirit. Because, you know the difference. You’re not really reading this. So, Reader, since you don’t really exist, since you’re all in my imagination… why not let me kiss you? Let me kiss you tonight in whichever manner does not feel offensive to you. May I kiss your hand, Reader? Lightly upon the lips? More deeply, so that we both fall over ourselves? Along your chest? May I kiss you until you and I, who must inevitably be parted, may nevertheless remain entangled at some spooky subatomic level? As scientists have teleported photons across the distance, I want to teleport my experience to you. No? Maybe? Let’s talk about something else? Well. Okay… People like us aren’t the writers to whom writers refer. Could we ever be? Discuss. "

    "body": "1 Three alarms on my cell phone failed to wake me up on Saturday morning. I slept peacefully through to the afternoon. Checking my email, I saw that the one book I had been trying to sell on Amazon had finally been sold. I took care of that first, just to get it out of the way. There was a terrible line at the post office, so I left, bought an envelope at Fred Meyer, then came back and used the stickery metery printy machine instead of waiting. I finished cleaning and packing. I put everything into my car. I got an oil change done, along with some expensive maintenance procedure that the people at Jiffy Lube suggested I get done. I got lost taking what I had thought would be a good route to I-90. Finally on the interstate, driving through the rain after sunset, my left windshield wiper flew off. I stopped at the first gas station off the next exit. “Um, I wonder if you have a suggestion,” I said to the clerk, “My windshield wiper came off. ” “Wipers are in the back,” she said, pointing. I found the correct blades and figured out how to snap them in. I never had changed a windshield wiper before. It seemed like this was always the way I learned the little skills of life: when I needed to, out of necessity. (Certainly, although I had forgotten, someone must at some point in my life have changed windshield wipers in front of me. They probably had, in fact, changed my own in front of me… but I kept no recollection of how they had done it. If I had watched, then I had learned nothing. Was there something lacking in the way I learned things? I had thought about this before… I seemed to want to be taught everything through supervised practice, in the way that I had learned how to drive. I would almost never, for example, cook an egg in a way that was new to me, unless a more experienced person was instructing me. Simply watching another person do something did not help me to emulate their actions later. ) I drove to Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, then north a bit to the cabin I had reserved. It was 2 in the morning when I arrived. I used the combination that I had been given to open a lock box on the side of the visitor’s center. I took keys and a map from there and found my way down a dirt path. I drank from a water gallon in the dim cabin light. 2 I woke up, looked out the cabin window, and saw what had been hidden by the dark when I had arrived. It was an amazing sight; the campground I had stayed in was gorgeous. I got funny looks at a gas station, because Idaho is crazy and I have long hair and I was wearing a long chain and pendant. When, partway through Montana, it started raining again, I noticed that my wipers were acting up. I pulled off at an exit to try to play with them some—an event apparently exciting enough that not only did someone from the local sheriff’s department pull up to see what I was doing, but another cop car soon followed. Nothing helped, so from then on I just had to keep playing with the wiper settings, trying to fool the arms into lining up with each other properly. I drove across all of Montana, across the northeast corner of Wyoming, and finally arrived in Rapid City, South Dakota. I settled in at my hotel and went to sleep. I woke up to a call from the front desk, telling me that the check-out time had been twenty minutes prior. My lower back was suddenly hurting like nobody’s business. I blamed it on the driving that I had done from west of Billings through to South Dakota with no stops to stretch at all, combined with my sleep-sprinting to the hotel room phone. I was beginning to feel rather certain that I would need to extend my travel time to a day longer than originally planned. I had intended rather ambitiously to be in eastern Pennsylvania after only another two days of driving. I stopped at Mount Rushmore, then. I paid three dollars for twenty ounces of Vitamin Water. “That’s just for the Vitamin Water?” I asked the guy. “Yup,” he said, “Welcome to Mount Rushmore. ” Then he seemed to realize what that sounded like coming from an employee there, backtracked, and blamed it on the rising cost of fuel. At a gas station I came across, an attendant kindly tightened the screws for the arms of the windshield wipers. They worked, then. Heading east, I detoured a bit to pass through some of the Badlands. When I reached a booth and was asked to pay fifteen dollars to continue through the national park, I was in a cheap mood and detoured further. I got back on the highway and drove, drove, drove, but barely made it into Minnesota before the pain in my back led me to get a hotel room and plop down in bed. I watched television, which I hadn’t done for awhile. The programming was about the same as always. 3 Although I felt only slightly better the next day, I had down to a science my way of adjusting pillows for my back and rear. I covered a lot of ground, never stopping for long. In Chicago I saw, for the first time, regular unleaded gasoline selling for $3. 99 per gallon. I have never seen it priced that high before. This was the point in my trip at which the drivers started to be crazy again. In the northwest it had seemed that the operators of motor vehicles were more considerate and safety-minded; over the mountains and across the plains there just hadn’t been much traffic around at all. What I was seeing in Chicagoland was that old, familiar madness. I sped up a bit and drove more offensively because, y’know, when in Rome. I stopped at another Super 8, this one in Ohio. It took me approximately forever to get to sleep, unfortunately, and once again I was woken up by a call from the front desk asking me (in polite terms) when the hell I was going to leave. Then it was straight ahead until I reached Arden. 4 North Wales, Pennsylvania. I took phone calls remotely for three hours on Thursday, as previously arranged. I also purchased some amenities for myself, coffee and shampoo and that sort of thing. Mostly, though, the time disappeared, there with Arden. I worked for another three hours on Friday, then got ready for my job interview at Montgomery County Community College. Arden had seemed strangely resentful, I could vaguely recall, when in the morning I had insisted against her holding me in bed for any longer. This was very early in our new arrangement, I thought, to have her seeming angry about something that I thought she already knew about me—that I was a monster best avoided when first waking up. I just didn’t like the feel of being physically prevented from going where I wanted to go when my mind was not yet fully operational and when my body was reminding me of all the substances (food, coffee, etc. ) for which it craved. The interview at MCCC was for a position at the Office of Records and Registration. I thought that it went very well, all smiles and engaging chatter. There was some uncertainty about whether I would be leaving on that evening or on Saturday for my visit to Massachusetts. I was leaning more toward Saturday, because I wanted to spend more time with Arden first. Unfortunately, that evening took another awkwardly tense turn, as according to her plans she was supposed to catch a train for a concert in Philly. We were cuddling in bed, then. I said, teasingly, “Get your clothes on!” and she immediately looked upset, got up, gathered her clothes, and took a shower. “I would have been glad to just stay in bed with you instead of going to the show,” she said, her hair wet. “Well, I don’t see why you couldn’t have just said, ‘No, I’m staying,’ then,” I said. “No. You don’t, do you?” She already seemed like a different person to me, and it had only been two nights. Once she was gone, I wanted to leave for Massachusetts right away. I was scared. I knew better than to leave, though; that would have been too dramatic of me. I let my fear melt into sadness. I fell asleep. She returned. I woke up. We were lying around for a bit. She would need to go to sleep soon. I had just slept for some four or five hours, and wasn’t going to be able to fall back to sleep. I told her that I was going to drive up north, then. It would be easier to make the drive at night, anyway. So we parted ways for the time being. 5 The first person I saw in Northampton was Julian. I was pulling into a parking space and there he was with Heidi, his girlfriend from Indiana. I parked, exited the car, stood tall and said, “Hello!” He came up and hugged me and introduced me to Heidi. Then there were a few awkward seconds. He said that the gathering at the World War II Club would be starting at 8:30, a few hours later. On my own then, I got coffee at Haymarket and walked around. Nellie said hey and asked where I had been. I said that I had been far away, in different cities. She was barefoot. She said something about how it would only take a short while of feeling pain from walking barefoot before she would be calloused enough to go without shoes for the rest of the summer. We parted at the intersection at the center of town. At Pleasant Street Theater I saw that they were screening a movie about the Young @ Heart Chorus, which included and was associated with folks who had worked in the Drama Department at Holyoke Community College back when I had been there. The next showing was sold out, though, so I walked on. I saw that a new coffee shop, the Yellow Sofa, had opened on Main Street, so I went in there, got another coffee, sat down, and wrote. The weather outside was not unlike what I had grown accustomed to in Washington state; sometimes it was raining, and sometimes it wasn’t. Since Alix had given me her number, I tried sending her a text message. After my phone informed me that the number was a land line, I called her up and said, “Wow, people still have land lines?” She and Derrick were preparing to head to the hot tub place for some sort of couples’ massage package. I said, “Wow, you have some really good plans for tonight, then!” She said that she would try calling me the next day. I said okay. I picked up a copy of The Atlantic from the Beyond Words Bookstore, then sat in the Bluebonnet Diner reading it and eating a grilled cheese sandwich until it was time to hit the Deuce. Smoking wasn’t allowed there anymore, a fact which in my view lessened the place’s coolness. Lyric was present; we were surprised to see each other. She was there for Julian’s going away, too. As it turned out, it was mostly her that I was hanging out with throughout the night. We sang karaoke together on Melanie’s version of “Ruby Tuesday”, she sang alone on a Pretenders song, and I sang alone on Nirvana’s “All Apologies”. Outside on smoke breaks, I was having my memory refreshed about how curious the random people talking to me outside of bars could be. A man who looked considerably more muscular than myself initiated conversation upon overhearing that I was musician. His body was shaking, and this made him look furiously angry. “I used to have long hair,” he said, “Back in the early ’90s, when I was really into metal. I couldn’t listen to Tori Amos and still feel like a man. ” He said that he dabbled in stand-up comedy. He told a couple of jokes (which I didn’t understand at all) then mumbled and walked away when he saw that I wasn’t laughing. (He later asked me what I thought of Dio, and appeared not to know how to respond when I told him that I wasn’t very familiar with his work. ) Salma and Johnny showed up while Lyric and I were on one of these smoke breaks. We and some other folks got talking about our experiences traveling in America. The time at the club seemed to pass quickly. By 1:45, it was only Lyric and I left. I got in touch with Kelsey and plotted to rendezvous at Dunkin’ Donuts to go to the diner. I talked to Lyric about Arden for a bit. Whenever I started to mention the couple of awkward moments that I already had with her in Pennsylvania, she wouldn’t hear them. It occurred to me that I didn’t know who I would be able to talk to or confide in as a friend, regarding my relationship. Kelsey showed up. She was drunk, but I only recognized this fact because she informed us of it. Witty banter followed during the car ride and our time at the Whately Diner. I dropped her off, then dropped off Lyric, then went back to my mom’s place. 6 I woke up on the wrong side of the couch. The television in the spare bedroom hadn’t been plugged in, so I had brought pillows and a blanket into the living room and fallen asleep watching C-SPAN. I didn’t just feel grumpy or spacey; I felt depressed, and frightened by the idea of anyone seeing me in this state. Salma called, informing me of where to go for her graduation. The thought of finding my way through a crowd and figuring out where to go on my own felt this morning like an overwhelming challenge. Her parents were supposed to be there, and now my mind was petrified at the thought of meeting them. (I didn’t get like this very often, did I? This was just once in a great while, right?) I had felt pretty confident and outgoing since my arrival in Massachusetts. Now that was gone. I remained on the couch, missing the ceremony. Salma called again, saying that they were heading to Paul &amp; Elizabeth’s to eat. I drove to Northampton and told Salma on the phone that I would be there to meet them. I walked inside Thorne’s Marketplace, stepped into the restaurant, looked around and didn’t see them. I browsed around the bookstore, waiting. I was sending a text message to Salma, asking if she was there, when out of the corner of my eye I was pretty sure that I saw her father and her brother, Haris. I canceled the sending of the message and walked away, hating that I was in public at all, until I got to the car. I started driving. She called again, saying that they were starting their appetizers. I said, “No, no, don’t worry about me, I actually think I’m not going. ” My phone beeped: “Call was lost”. She didn’t call back. Blank-faced, I kept driving. Soon I would have the comfort of hiding away and doing nothing. “What happened?” asked my mom. “Nothing,” I said. I went to sleep. 7 I visited with Alix. It was nice. She seemed happy and in a good situation with Derrick. He had introduced her to his therapist, who was helping her to understand some things. Then I stopped in for karaoke at Packards—Julian and Heidi were there—but I didn’t stay for long. I spent the next day trying to set up anti-virus software on my mother’s computer, plus sorting through what I wanted to leave in Massachusetts and what I wanted to bring to Pennsylvania. I drove back to North Wales through the overnight, returning home just barely too late to see Arden before she worked. I said hello to the cats. I had not been selected for a second interview for the position at the community college. I had sent an email to Jim at the answering service job to say that I could work more hours if they were available. 8 It happened sort of as I had suspected: time went by, and I wasn’t stopping to journal much as I settled in. There were times when I worried. Arden wasn’t in the habit of sharing space, and she had liked living alone. There were days when she referred to the arrangement as “stressful”, although she said that she wanted me there. I increased my hours working for the answering service; I did this job from the living room while she was at work. She went to a lot of shows, taking the train into Philly to see them, while I did my solitary artist thing. It was an odd, but fortunate arrangement—working from home in the suburbs, going out on occasion but for the most part staying in, and commuting all the way to Johns Hopkins’s Baltimore campus once a week and also its D. C. once a week for classes toward a Master of Arts in Fiction Writing. 9 June 11, 2008. I didn’t recognize the White House until a sign told me what it was. It still didn’t look like the White House to me, somehow. 10 Hanging out in the surrounding area after class at the main campus of Johns Hopkins University. A sticky day, but not terrible—about average for what I’ve encountered in Baltimore. Outside, in particular, it does take me back. What I’ve come to think of as my second adolescence, that span of my early twenties when I was a constant fixture on the streets of Northampton, Massachusetts… I didn’t hide from the heat so much then, I guess, since I would likely have company out there in the sun, and since company meant so much to me back then. 11 I went to the Philadelphia Art Museum for the first time. Arden, who went with me, thought I wasn’t enjoying myself, but I actually loved the experience. I had never been to an art museum before. “The two major emotions… or, I guess they’re not really emotions, but whatever… that I feel on a daily basis,” I said to her some days later on a related note, “Are anxiety—a stressed-out compulsion to get things done—and joie de vivre. ” We went to Massachusetts for the holiday weekend and I got to introduce her to people. I never got around to warning her and the other friends I brought along that the low-key vegetarian cookout we were attending at Daisy’s new apartment was slated to transform into an underwear party, in which most everyone except us stripped down to their skivvies and danced and threw rinds from the vodka-injected watermelon at each other across the front lawn while the four of us remained clothed, hanging out in the grass, smoking cigarettes and lying on each other while the neighbors passed, dog-walking. And family events, and hanging out on Saturday at a nice house sort of in the middle of nowhere for a welcome home for Janelle (back from Korea), with a small child jumping on a trampoline and out there over the trees, where the view is nice, some amateur fireworks. More people saying that they remember me, but I don’t remember them. Then it’s back to reading. I have two nights to ingest The Leopard. Also have to finish a short paper on Janet Frame’s Owls Do Cry. Lots that I should get a start on. Adjusting my planned Fall schedule. Family, as usual, didn’t know where I was living. Even my mom didn’t know that I was living with a girlfriend. She thought that Arden was a boy, a roommate. Guess I hadn’t spoken clearly enough. My family, who see my being “still in school” as an eccentricity. And I get awkward, and remember that I had to email an assignment, and I should work on that, and in the daytime in Pennsylvania I work from home but the VoIP is making everyone sound like robots, and I’m not bringing in as much money for myself as I wish I were, and the ideas bunch up in my mind and too long without some sort of journal-writing, it feels like being without dreamful sleep, like I don’t know where in the narrative I am. And at the copy shop or grocery store I nervously look away from people of every age, not needing to think all the things I’m apt to think, not needing the inspiration, not needing the joy of life, because I’m still not caught up, and it’s still not evident, still not evident how very satisfied I am in this ongoing everywhere and nowhere. 12 July 28. I think every day about how lucky I am. "

    "body": "13 I’m not quite used to her quiet. I know better than to try to push her. I guess she’s wishing that the course of this day, and our moods, could fit together naturally. You know. It’s those intractable minor frustrations: neither of us can help if we’re in different head-spaces, are in different moods, or if she’s more energetic on sunny days and I’m more energetic when it’s cloudy. If I tried to push myself to feel differently, to want to do something different, to have another sort of day, that wouldn’t be any more satisfying for her. So, I suppose, to ensure that I’m doing what I want to be doing (especially with my being so busy now) there’s no conversation—just that quiet bummed-out look on her. But the unsaid makes me nervous, so these are also the days when I remember, again, that long-running thought that I’m easy to love but that maybe keeping me isn’t worth it—because perhaps there’s no substitute for predictability. As much as I’ve learned to manage, and as much as my good qualities might seem to outweigh the bad, I’m still an erratic person, unpredictable and for that reason frustrating. She says that I make her feel like she’s a creature of habit, someone with a rigid routine, whereas previously she always felt she was the very opposite of that. She wishes that we could fall asleep together more often. We have that problem of, when we have a block of time to spend together, we can’t figure out what to do. The good news is, those are pretty much the only problems we have—simple, little things. The bad news is, I know that these simple, little things, the things which neither of us can control, are important to her. She often says, “We’re so different,” and resists when I suggest that we’re similar in this or that way. It’s sad to hear, when we do converse, how disappointed she sounds, insisting that there’s nothing I can do. She talks about how satisfying living alone was. I take her at her word that she wants me around and wants to be with me; but a part of me still thinks, That’s what they all say. Her quiet reminds me of other, more vicious sorts of quiet. I just wait and hope until, usually before long, we’re comfortable again. 14 Aug. 8, 2008. Fiction Techniques class at Johns Hopkins, with its closing weeks featuring one workshopped piece per student. For me it went as well as one always hopes for, with constructive feedback, classmates bowing and over-complimenting, food brought in inspired by the fiction (which was written from the perspective of a jelly doughnut), laughter at the humor and recognition of the concepts behind my fiction—an ego-booster, and a bit of a circus, while also a helpful workshop. This Saturday is the end of that class, with the finale being half in a classroom and half in a pub. Unfortunately, I failed to look closely at the syllabus for my other class, which breaks with its usual schedule and gives us two classes next week. This means that the very busy two weeks of homework for which I was planning are now condensed into one week of insanity. 15 And after we’ve known each other fourteen months or so, Arden asked, Do you have a best friend. And I said, no. And she was like, Someone you go to when you need to talk about things. And I was like, no, I probably should, I’ve been wanting you to be the person I go to for that. 16 The day after the semester ended, I lay down on the couch with a book. I poked thoughtlessly with my finger at the most rotted out of my wisdom teeth. Then I adjusted my position, reading some more, and suddenly there was a wave of intense pain. So I decided that I would find a dentist to call the next day. In a list of dentists found online, there wasn’t much to really distinguish one from another, so I chose the office that had the most exotic listing of languages accommodated. I was told that they would see me in a few hours. They gave me x-rays, the doctor told me that I need my wisdom teeth extracted, and another procedure, some sort of deep-cleaning of the gums. There are cavities, too, but minor, just in need of basic fillings. Okay. Could be worse, seeing as how this is the first time in my adult life I’ve seen a dentist. 17 I didn’t want to go out to the bar where Arden and her friend Doug were going tonight. I was successfully talked into going, but I drove myself, and once there, I couldn’t bring myself to order a beer and stay. Five minutes in, I said goodbye and left. I guess it’s the sort of place that most of the people I’ve known wouldn’t enjoy. So, I felt reminded of how I’ve kind of cut myself out from my past, but how I haven’t done a lot to find new ways of having fun. I don’t have anywhere I want to be that’s outside of a classroom. Even my mother said to me recently, You have to have some fun, it can’t just be work all the time. And my mother hardly ever gives me advice on anything. Arden said to me, I really believe that you feel things deeply. But it stays in here. (Touching my chest. ) 18 Trying to renew my auto insurance is a pain. I’m having to be inventive, trying to satisfy the company with proof that I now live in Pennsylvania even though I’ve been working for a company in Washington and although the tuition I’ve been paying is for a school in Maryland and although apparently my credit report makes it look as though I’m still in Massachusetts. Then, I was suddenly laid off tonight… well, I guess it was still afternoon there in Seattle. They said that they were sorry to do it, it had nothing to do with my performance, but somebody looked into the liabilities of having employees working out-of-state, and there would have been costs to the company because of workman’s compensation requirements. So, farewell, answering service job. Thanks for giving me absolutely no notice after 11 months. It’s what I’ve come to expect from employers. So, what now? I’m typing to myself. Arden asleep in the bed. And on the couch here in the living room, while I type on Arden’s desktop computer, is Doug. Oh, Doug. Arden’s forty-one-year-old co-worker, who has been hanging out with us frequently. He just bought a condo and is completely renovating it… so he comes over frequently to shower. On nights like this, when he gets inebriated enough, he crashes here. I had been informed earlier in the day that we would be going to the karaoke place down the street, as we have done twice in previous weeks. When it approached the time for us to go, though, Arden was having a change of heart. So just Doug and I went, but he was too messed up already when we got there, he was telling me to order a drink for him because he didn’t want to ask for it himself, and we were standing in the corner and it was hard to follow what he was trying to say. So basically, we walked in the door with him already seeming like the friend you have to drive home because you see that he’s in no condition to be out any longer. After quickly downing one beer (while the 2008 Olympics played on big screens and some people sang “Lean On Me”) I said let’s go, and we did. 19 It feels like I’m just trying to do the right thing by her. Feeling bad for not being able to fall asleep at the same time she does. Trying to think of something that the two of us could do together that would soothe me in the way that writing or reading soothes me. Trying to be happy without doing anything: for her, enjoying life means relaxing, while for me, enjoying life means doing things. She starts cooking for me more often. I want to cook for her instead, but I’m “not allowed in the kitchen”. I don’t know how to cook. I don’t even recognize half of the ingredients she likes to put in things. Why should she cook for me? I can’t do anything for her. I get stressed out trying to figure out how not to get depressed when it’s the two of us spending time together. I’ve come to dread the weekends, because then it’s just the two of us, and there’s nothing in our current lifestyle that we can do together that I really enjoy doing. 20 Yesterday, any Republican I saw on TV was still ridiculing Obama’s qualifications. Today we learn that McCain’s VP pick is Sarah Palin, someone who has only been a governor for as long as Obama has been running for President. Um… thanks? I think Obama and Biden have it this year. This is me having faith that if any demographic knows when it’s being talked down to, it’s women. But I still think it’s disgusting that a major party will nominate candidates who say that, like, creationism should be taught in schools. When acting dumb on an issue like that can actually be a plus for a politician, America has a problem. 21 Well, I’m here in Massachusetts again. I left just as Diane was approaching; she was driving down from Brooklyn for a weekend in Philly with Arden. They had a hotel rented for themselves and everything. And over the course of the past however long, awkwardness between me and Arden. One night, even, of her leaving to sleep she-never-said-where, while I got all of my things together—it took five minutes—ready to load up in my car so that I might leave for good, depending how our text messaging went. (Then I expected to leave the next day, but I didn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to. ) And this time, also, I left to Massachusetts expecting that this was really it, and that I would while staying up here put together a plan to stay somewhere closer to my classes, or something… but I haven’t done that. I keep thinking, “Oh, I’d better leave here on Tuesday, because I have an interview in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. ” What is wrong? I sat on a bench in Northampton with Alice trying to figure that out. Communication issues: those definitely exist between me and Arden. And as she’s said repeatedly, she never really expected that she could keep me. And our life in North Wales has never contained anything, really, outside of the domestic sphere for me to enjoy. Talking to her… talking to her just hasn’t been good. I start to fear it… but I want nothing more, at the same time, because non-superficial conversation is a big thing for me. Mostly, it’s hard to pinpoint what actually is wrong, and it’s even harder to postulate what might be done to make things better. She kind of frames it as just me being unhappy, bored by her, and nothing I do can disprove that idea in her eyes. I don’t want to leave, but I have no reason to think that anything will improve. So, yeah, I drove up here on Friday night (arriving Saturday morning around 2 in the morning) and yesterday came to Northampton with Alice, ran into Alix (who is no longer with Derrick) outside of Haymarket and I had invited Kelsey to meet up with us, so we were hanging out with her until she left, and then it was Alice and Alix and me at WWII. Alix and I sang. Then to Alix’s, where I held Alice while she cried, and then the two of them were talking business, about photo shoots, and there was some looking through costume catalogs. Now it’s Sunday, and I’m waiting for Alix to come by. It’s early evening. 22 I don’t have time to go into it, in writing or in thought. I don’t have time to go into the past couple of nights. I’m waiting for Salma now, in Northampton. She hasn’t responded to a phone call and text, but we’ll see what happens. I’m writing for a purpose at this point. What to do? Do I need any more classes at Johns Hopkins? I’ve accomplished something by doing that coursework, I would guess that I could get a couple of writing instructor recommendations and could use that, could apply again to funded programs, transfer in, do things that way, and perhaps avoid taking on debts that I don’t need to. However, I’ve only taken two courses, so that’s two professors. Would I try to contact, say, the instructor for that Lifelong Writing course that I took at UMass? The idea of that does not excite me terribly much. Meanwhile, one of the courses I’m supposed to start next week is on Teaching Writing, which would definitely be nice to have behind me while trying to sell myself as a T. A. 23 Sep. 8, 2008. Baltimore, Maryland. I get to the building in which class is going to be held. It’s a class on The Short Story. At the entrance, the security people don’t have any information on the class, but they do let me sign in. I go up to the office of the Writing Seminars and there’s the instructor, who leads me down the stairs and lets me in to the room. (I’m about forty minutes early. ) Now it’s just waiting. I’m glad we’re slowly approaching fall. Things with Arden have been better since my trip to Massachusetts. I sort of had to admit to myself that the real problem was my attitude, my failing to work on making myself happy, my obsession with talking and compromising as a way to make anything better. I need to be sure that I look out for my own happiness, is all. I cried multiple times while in Massachusetts, all of those times while talking with Alix. It was just as much of an emotional roller coaster being around her as it always had been before. One night she was surprising me by making advances and talking as if the two of us were going to start dating again. (Or, maybe, we were going to be friends and I would work for her online business. It alternated. ) The next day, we were talking about the past and she was deciding to take Derrick back. (They had broken up and called off the engagements after a slow fizzling of their relationship and a long period of tension. ) 24 Sep. 21. A new job in Horsham, Pennsylvania. I’m handling phones, some inbound but mostly outbound, for a company that provides for various membership organizations a way to sell cars at discounted prices through an existing network of dealerships. So far there has been a lot of sitting around, but today I was stupid and forgot to bring a book. Now I’m staring at the walls of my cubicle, which, while being green, also manage to appear sort of gray. Web surfing is discouraged, and so… and so… yeah. Arden is in Brooklyn. She left yesterday morning and returns this afternoon. 25 Oct. 3. Work is mostly okay. There has been a lot of downtime again these past few days; it has been easy to get reading done for class. At times, between reading assigned stories, I just stare, not actually reading, at the pages and try to think of how to be a writer. Funny how, even as I’m doing a Master’s degree in Writing, even as my life is really centered around all that, it isn’t the sort of thing I feel that I can bounce off anyone conversationally. I can’t say to anyone, “You know, I’m wondering what my plan of attack should be. I wonder what’s the best strategy as I try to build recognition for myself, try to publish frequently, try to establish and maintain contact with other writers. ” I still haven’t escaped that position from which aspiration—aspiration of any sort—feels like something for which I need to profusely apologize. 26 Oct. 9. Another apocalypse, this time financial. We all saw something coming, all heard murmurs, sometimes clear words. Bubble, falling dollar, debt, gradual collapse of an empire. I think I’m about done writing my Statement of Purpose for M. F. A. programs. I’ve talked to Arden about where-would-you-like-to-live. Her lease is up at the end of, I think, June. At night when I come home after getting out of work at eleven o’clock I think that I’m going to go online and try to make friends but I only, what do I do, I read about the election instead. I read every little thing about the race between Barack Obama and John McCain. Wait a minute, think about it, you’re living in the year 2008 now. Are you lost? Are you found? It’s a whole new Internet and it’s about as welcoming as most of the world, which is to say not at all. No. No, sometimes just bitter thoughts. Sometimes it’s just the suburbs here and not much in the way of conversation and it’s a silent life and I stay in a motel room once a week in Maryland, going to class one night in Baltimore and the next night in D. C. , and I usually don’t keep a journal and it sometimes seems that Arden and I hardly interact at all and I talk to no one but she’s going to Maine the weekend after next and I think I’m going with her even though I don’t know I don’t know what is this it’s like I’m locked up in something and I don’t know what and I don’t even I don’t even I don’t even I don’t even but that would be somewhere to go and I want somewhere to go and maybe I can face to face I say a few words and then you say a few words I want a conversation I want a conversation I’m living with a girlfriend and I never have a conversation and I don’t want to leave but without even that and do I even know you and do you even know me isn’t there more than this it feels like there was always more than this with anyone with a friend with a person I might just happen to see on the street once every great while so how can it be like this and while we’re in bed in the dark she asks me if being around her is bad more than it’s good. 27 At work again. Monday to Tuesday was again me driving to Baltimore and going to class (discovering during our break one fellow cigarette-smoking classmate) and then heading south to College Park, where the Days Inn has become my once-a-week home. A night of doing some coursework, considering what to write as a second pastiche/style imitation for Short Story class (rather a waste of time) and then checking out a few minutes before noon, driving down the street for a bite to eat, sitting for a while at Starbucks doing work, printing off things at the FedEx Office (f. k. a. FedEx/Kinko’s, f. k. a. Kinko’s) then driving into D. C. and parking and sitting around in the building where my class is and then going to class and then driving back to Pennsylvania, arriving in North Wales at around 1 in the morning. This time, Arden was still awake. She had gone to a concert, and on the train ride home had been putting together, using her iPod, her Ani DiFranco mix for our car ride to Maine. We’ve decided that in advance of our trip we should choose CDs that we want the other to listen to (full albums or mixes of songs from a band) and that one of those discs should for each of us be a compilation of our favorite Ani songs. On Monday night I sent an email to that instructor at UMass, asking very nicely and professionally whether he would help me with another round of recommendations. I haven’t heard anything back. Asking a professor with whom I’m taking my first class would be awkward enough (although I did it before) and I haven’t been very talkative in this Short Story class. So now I’m left considering what it would mean for me to not apply to M. F. A. Programs. As always, it seems like I have plans for what I’m doing with my life, but those plans change every two weeks or so. I’ll do some more web research tonight, crunch some numbers. I’m glad we’re going to Maine soon so I can at least see the place to which it seems likely Arden will at some point want to move. 28 I find myself trying to slip bits of life as I know it into my fiction. I do this, of course, under the guise of a postmodernist just toying with absurdity. You know. Ha-ha. Imagine a literary world in which I or anyone I’ve ever known personally might possibly exist. So: the written assignment, a “pastiche”, a “sketch”. I thought the class and professor were more generous about it than I deserved, actually. It was polished, but polished into a mess. In any case… A pastiche of Gogol, and let me tell you, I feel Gogol, love Gogol, and forgive him his faults. But here’s an illustration of what I’m conscious of when I’m writing at Johns Hopkins (and really, in general, for a literary/academic readership). Amongst all the Gogolian touches, what the professor zooms in on is the setting, a community college in Massachusetts, and the classmates—a twenty-five-year-old woman who is learning Algebra for the first time (imagine such a thing!) and a seventeen-year-old who has written a play called Memory of a Nightmare. “So,” says the professor, “The boy must be precocious, but he’s here at this junior college, which must be because he lacks money. The other character asks whether she can just buy a single egg at the cafeteria. So we’re seeing a penuriousness, but of a sort I don’t actually think exists in real life. Why not just write this about undergraduates at Johns Hopkins, or even UMBC?” But occasionally, the others in the classroom don’t catch me. Sometimes, if it passes as comic absurdity, I get to smuggle into my fiction writing a tiny piece of my own experience. I am deeply satisfied when this happens. "

    "body": "29 It was a long ride to Maine. Three nights in Portland and one night near Augusta. Day trips to a beach in Machiasport, far up the coast (where a couple of us, excluding me, were eager to take an off-season dunk in the water)… and to somewhere or other—I lost track—for a small neighborhood cider-pressing… and to a farm in Scarborough, where, walking around, I ate kale and carrot while piglets tried to eat my shoes. Today, in Baltimore, waiting for the elevator up to class, a classmate says hi to me. I don’t recognize her at first because she’s bundled up as if it’s winter. She talks about the sudden cold. I’ve learned in my adult life to avoid disagreeing with people about weather (as, when I’m honest, I usually do disagree), but in this case, next to my shivering and bundled-up classmate, I feel that I should account for the fact that I’m dressed the exact same way I would have been (and was) dressed during the summer. I forgot to bring layers today, I say. She says that she was in Florida last week, so that must have thrown her off. Ah, I said, I was in Maine last week, so, yeah. 30 Nov. 5. First of all, yay, obviously, for a sizable victory for Barack Obama. Though, the passing of proposition 8 in California makes me quite sad. I was pretty out of it when I was voting, in the midst of day four of sudden and intense abdominal agony (and, as a side effect, lack of sleep—just pain, pain, all the time). Finally today I was put to sleep for an upper endoscopy, in which a doctor looked into my stomach, discovered “at least seven large non-bleeding cratered gastric ulcers”, and after my waking said that in twenty years he had only seen one or two stomachs in such horrific shape, usually as a result of something like “drinking acid”. I told him that I’m a cigarette smoker and that I drink a whole lot of coffee, but he just shook his head as if to say that was not even in the same league as what we were talking about. So, basically, my stomach was suddenly and mysteriously mutilated. I have some medicine that I got yesterday, and I slept through last night, and I feel better today. So, the hope is that this will heal up all right, and I’ll be going back in a couple of weeks to report how things are going, and then in another six weeks they’re supposed to put another camera down my throat. 31 The Maine trip has been stuck in my head. I liked all of Arden’s friends, although by night two my mood had gone downhill. I was awkward and feeling left out, while also sad and frustrated with myself from the recognition that my awkwardness, my feeling of strangeness in my own life seems to be getting worse. One would hope that with time—say, by the time one is twenty-seven years old—such tendencies would have effectively muted themselves. So, I was feeling down on myself. After so much time atrophying in suburban Pennsylvania this trip sounded perfect to me, and I was expecting that the scene here would feel like a familiar breath of fresh air. And the last two full days we spent there did feel more like that to me. I felt really moody, though, on that second night. 32 The gathering near Augusta was at Ariel’s place. Everyone came along for that. Ariel was immediately friendly. Her next door neighbor and friend, Lizzy (also cool) joined in, along with other folks, and then there were charades and then there was a trip to one bar, then another bar. At the second bar I didn’t care much for the music that the live band was playing but eventually I danced anyway. Arden and I had a room to ourselves. And… One brief scene seems to have burned itself into my memory to represent our whole trip to Maine. The scene was this: the festivity has picked up, drinks have happened, the charades have happened… this is just before we leave to hit the bars. I decide to find Arden and Ariel. Maybe I ask for Arden and am told they went into the other room, I don’t know. The room they went into is the living room, sort of, but it appears to have been built to be a bedroom, it’s on the opposite side of the apartment from the sunporch, where everyone is hanging out to smoke. This room is where we all set down our possessions when we entered; it’s also where Arden and I will be sleeping. It’s also where the stereo is. Arden and Ariel have gone into that room. I see that the door has been closed. Drinks in me. I hesitate for a moment, aw, it’s a closed door, but then I say, wait, that sort of hesitation is usually for nothing, I usually regret when I hesitate over stupid things like a closed door at a party. So I knock on the door. I knock again. I just hear the music still playing at a loud volume. It was earlier the Juno movie soundtrack that was playing, Moldy Peaches and all, but that’s ended, and it’s something different now. I decide that alcohol could easily forgive me for stepping inside, so I step inside. I see Arden slow dancing with Ariel. They’re smiling, one talking into the other’s ear. It occurs to me that I have no idea what this is to them—a revisiting of something they used to do all the time, dancing together, or a dancing together for the first time, or what. I know that they’re friends, but I don’t know their stories. Not only am I new to seeing it, but I don’t have an image of it in my mind. Min and Lorenzo, the longtime best friends—I have ideas in my head about what that sort of friendship means. But here’s something else. And there are so many other something-elses in Arden’s life that I, living with her in Pennsylvania, haven’t formed any ideas about. Here’s one friendship, and she has many others, and they’re stories whose beginnings I don’t know, but I can drop in in the middle, into a scene like this, and see Arden in another tale, another something nice and good that she has been living all along, but whose essence is unfamiliar to me—unfamiliar, only because we’ve been far away from it geographically. Unfamiliar, because that’s just the way it is. I approach, not too quickly, and Ariel pulls me in to dance with them. Because of this, Ariel becomes the hero of the night for me. She reminds me that I am sometimes invited. I don’t want to start a new conversation or change the dance… don’t want to be a disruption… and for about a minute, I feel that I’ve been allowed that. Until the song ends, and then another mix is put on, but Ariel’s saying that we’re going to gather the people to go across the street to the bar… and it’s just me and Arden left to dance, and we’re both smiling, and I’m dancing with her, but then it’s like she’s stepping out from that other story and back into the less fun, more stressful story of my and her relationship. And Arden is less inclined to dance anymore, now that it’s just me and her in the room. She says that we’ll dance at the bar, and I say that that’s fine, but that this is really what I mean when I say that I like to dance. And Tori Amos comes on the mix. “Talula”—it’s an old mix CD. And I’m like, c’mon, please, keep dancing with me, and I’m dancing by myself, so now it’s silly. And she’s putting her hand on my chest. And I’ve always told her that I believed I would like all those other sides of her, those for-now-estranged aspects of her life, her routines on hiatus, more than she would expect. And she has never believed that. But that’s how I like her most—when my influence on her is minimal. When she’s full of tequila, doesn’t notice that I’m there, and is laughing at something I wouldn’t find funny. I write this all out now, I don’t even know how long after the fact. Two weeks, maybe? I could, of course, be doing other things, getting coursework done, or something, or something. But even when months pass and my lifestyle changes significantly, this is what wells up inside of me, this need to write it all down in some form. 33 Today is the day before Thanksgiving. I gave a teaching demonstration last night in my Teaching Writing class… I got through it, but my nerves were a problem. I can’t pretend to be a normal human being, that’s what I can’t do, but that’s all that most people need to do. Pretend to be normal and your life, your security can build itself around you… At least I try, I thought to myself, At least I know that I give these things the absolute best that I’ve got. I’ve had no trouble with my writing, no insecurity about my place as a graduate student. Meanwhile, Arden still doesn’t talk to me. I still don’t know what’s wrong when something is wrong, and I end up feeling stupid for caring and trying to ask. Don’t I know by now that she just won’t trust me with her feelings? 34 Dec. 22, 2008. At my mom’s place, going through my old video tapes. Throwing out more of them. I still can’t let go of all the video tapes of MTV music videos and such I recorded as a teenager. Videos of me are in there. There I am in the fourth grade on cable access TV, reporting the news from all the local public schools. Also, a video tape I made when I was sixteen—it seems to have been intended for some or other online friend. I spend about ten minutes being hesitant to step in front of the camera. I explain that this is because I’m hideous. I’m wearing black jeans, a black Animaniacs t-shirt, and a black cowboy hat. And white socks. I’m sitting on the couch on top of a mess of clean laundry. I hide my face behind my knees. Then there is the video of the first however many minutes of my play, Memory of a Nightmare, which I wrote and directed and starred in at community college when I was nineteen. I had a VHS of the rest of it, but soon after it was recorded the writer and director of Pinny, the other play on the bill that night, borrowed the tape and never gave it back to me. I literally can’t bring myself to watch my performance. That’s not really like me, but I can’t. Wow, I was thin… and so enthusiastic about sharing every association in my mind. I was high on the feeling that I didn’t need to be the guy hiding behind his knees on the couch anymore. These days, I feel more like my sixteen-year-old self. 35 Jan. 2, 2009. 6:35 AM. At a Starbucks here in North Wales, Pennsylvania. At least, I think this is technically North Wales. I lost some data recently in a computer disaster. If I lost many journal entries from my archives, I don’t know: I really can’t remember how much I’ve written. Did I even write about abandoning my Teaching Writing course and not signing up for any classes for the Spring semester? I woke up this morning, maybe dreaming, maybe just thinking of long ago. I woke up, noticing where Ted the cat was cuddled up next to me, in more or less his usual spot. I was awake and Arden was snoring and I tried to be careful, to maneuver myself so as not to wake her, so I also tried not to make the cat move. All was well; I accomplished that. Then to the bathroom. Without turning on the light, I coughed some gunk from my throat into a clump of toilet paper. Arden had been trying to say that maybe I wasn’t getting sick, that she was sniffling too and in her case she thought it was just the time of year and the dryness inside the apartment. The previous night, in bed before we went to sleep, I had said that nah, it was seeming to worsen, and that I didn’t think it would be anything bad but that I was pretty sure this was, you know, maybe what they call a minor head cold, I don’t know. I don’t pay much attention to little sicknesses and whatever. Sometimes Arden will sense that I’m resisting pressure being applied to my stomach area and she’s like, “Does your stomach hurt?” but I don’t know. When I’m relaxed I think I can notice better whether there’s a dull ache there. Relaxing doesn’t make it feel better? she asks, but I’m pretty sure I’m so used to waking up and going about my day, all the ins and outs of usual waking-hour activity, not showing how tired I am… or I’m used to trying to minimize how often I’m clearing my throat, that being the most persistent of my tics, and doesn’t my voice really get raspy when I contain the tic completely? I remember as a kid, going on that doctor’s visit, where I said that something was going on with my throat, and he said that no, there wasn’t, that it was all in my head. And honestly, there have been a couple of times now, probably the only reason I’ve ever seen doctors as an adult is stomach pain, and they always told me there was nothing wrong, the pain would be worse if something were really wrong… including the trip a couple months ago to the emergency room, when for the price of nearly what I earned last year—(I’m now in the begging and pleading for a reduction in my bill phase)—a doctor still failed to see what the specialist-ordered endoscopy later confirmed, namely a stomach that looked as though I had tried to kill myself by drinking poison. I eventually saw that I couldn’t afford to go back for the follow-up, even though what I thought was the total of my medical bills was only one-fifth of what I was eventually billed. It was just a few days ago when by far the largest bill finally came in. I was, when I received that bill, on the way to the post office to get stamps for mailing off installments of my other medical bill. I sat down in the car, thinking, “How long will this car last before I need a new one?” and crumpled up the bill in anger, hating everything. So, yeah. This morning, then, I went to the living room and checked my email on Arden’s computer. My computer is at a repair center somewhere, or maybe still en route to it. I’ve had a hard time adapting to living with a lover. It’s awkward for me, and I get weird without private time, and then it becomes stressful to try to tell the truth about why I seem awkward—there’s Arden asking whether she’s boring me, or what. And she’s someone who is content to do nothing, who looks forward to doing nothing, or who at least can stare at me when we’re both there, sitting or lying down, and who can make me feel like it’s only me who feels we should be talking to each other or watching a movie or going through a photo album or something. (When I stay up late after she goes to sleep, that bothers her. She says that she got some satisfaction out of the alone time when I was out of town two days a week, but when I’m in the apartment and she’s in bed it’s a different thing. ) I go to the bathroom and use the toilet. She wakes up and goes to the bathroom herself. I wander to the living room and wait until she goes back into the bedroom. Then I go back to the bathroom to start working on my hair. I want to go out and get a coffee somewhere and write or something. After a while it gets stressful for me to try to appear satisfied all the time when she’s around, because if I don’t then she starts making little negative comments about how of course I don’t want to be around her. It has been so long for me without friends around. Pulling out in the car, I started asking myself, Was I better or worse off a year ago? I remember that I thought that I would regret it (and I would have) if I didn’t try to be with Arden, whom I actually felt I could trust, who was so stable compared to what I had known. But now, when I’m in bad shape, or even if I’m not one hundred percent okay… if I miss anything or yearn for anything… Arden tries to cheer me up for about five minutes, then if she fails she takes it as a personal insult and walks away. It’s like feeling down is something she can’t accept, like she thinks it’s selfish, like she thinks it’s every person’s responsibility to appear cheerful. That’s Arden, the light to my dark, the one who likes summer and the daytime while I like winter and the nighttime. I asked her whether in previous relationships she always went to sleep at the same time as the person she was with. She said yes. I’ve never seen that before; I thought that all couples took time to themselves while the other slept. I haven’t been journaling at all, of course. I went to Massachusetts for Christmas, and now New Year’s has passed. I’ve been sitting in my car outside of that Starbucks, now, for a while. 36 I sort of came of age with the Internet. It’s interesting to reflect on how much has changed. I remember Prodigy and CompuServ… when Yahoo! directory listings were the definitive search engine… when animated GIFs began showing up on web pages… when America Online started mailing floppy disks by the gazillion to every home in the country… RealAudio streams (and eventually RealVideo)… …web rings… the MP3… AIM… Google… ShockWave animation… LiveJournal… online quizzes… …Friendster… Craigslist… Blogger… MySpace… Facebook. There really isn’t such a thing as “online culture” anymore, and I’ve had a hard time adjusting to this fact. The culture of the Internet from the mid 1990s to the early 2000s is in many ways where I came from and what I identify with. I suppose it was more or less inevitable that everyone and their grandmother should eventually get Internet access. Still, I can’t help miss the days when it was still exciting to meet a fellow Internet person in real life. The feeling of that was like when you’re somewhere far away and you meet someone who grew up in the same town as you. It shouldn’t feel like it means so much, but it really does. 37 Jan. 15. Computer still being repaired. It’s been since, what, the day after Christmas? Yeah. 38 I can’t even get around to faxing out the application for charity for the seven or eight thousand dollar bill for inept medical attention. "

    "body": "39 North Wales, Pennsylvania. I don’t know. I really don’t know. The other night it was like Arden was ready to call it quits. Meanwhile, she’s just always waiting for me to call it quits. I started thinking, one day at work this week, answering phones for a water delivery service, taking equal parts U. S. And Canadian calls, when I was on a cigarette break, standing outside in a cold that is cold but is not the worst of cold, is not a fierce wind freezing every inch of exposed skin, that maybe I just haven’t gotten to the point yet where I’m really convinced that living together with someone is what I want. Like, my brain is struggling so much, always ready to dive into the activities, the ways of being that it’s used to filling its days with. My brain wasn’t prepared to be part of a couple 24/7. I tried mentioning some of these thoughts to Arden. Stupid of me? It feels like it, but with our lives being shared to this extent it’s like, it would be a big thing for me to just, what, take some time aside and write in a journal every night? Knowing that she was waiting for me to head home. So if someone is going to get a status update, if I’m going to converse about my feelings with anyone, it won’t even be paper, it’ll be her. But then it’s always, from her, “Well, how am I supposed to take that?” and “If you feel this way, then why are you with me?” and I don’t even get to express the initial feeling, let alone gain a better understanding of it through discussion, because my tactless attempts at honesty have offended her, and then she needs reassurance, but it’s not a simple reassurance, and she won’t make it simple for me, because her fear that I just don’t care runs so deeply, apparently, that it’s like she’s jumping at every chance to see evidence that I don’t want to be with her, or whatever. I feel inept. We have communicated, though, and in the past months some gains seemed to have been made. I called my mom, just now, from the parking lot of the Montgomery Mall. Began to say that I’ve hit a rough spot with Arden… made a reference to how my aunt, Kim, keeps suggesting that I should work in some capacity for the school that she works at. My mom just stayed silent. So I guess I won’t be going back to Massachusetts, because if I was going to do that I would want to be making a decent amount of money and gaining a decent amount of work experience. The area I’m in now, anywhere near my work, is expensive. As far as temporary housing, I couldn’t find a sublet or anything outside of the city, and I am not especially tempted to commute from the city. I had not been planning for a move. I had stopped with the contingency plans. I was not really prepared, at least not psychologically, for this relationship to fail. Last night I said in some dumb sort of way that I wanted to stay but I didn’t want it to be how it’s been. And Arden was like, I don’t want it like this, either, you’re being so cold, and I was like, I prefer this to when all my energy is going into trying to act the right way and say the right thing so that you’ll stay happy. It ended up sounding like I was saying, “I’ll stay, but I’m going to be a dick to you, and if you don’t like it then you can break up with me. ” She keeps saying how sad it will be if we don’t get the opportunity to be together in a more accommodating situation, in a bigger apartment, in a locale we both like. I guess that’s true, but ever since she more or less did break up with me (the next morning she asked whether I would agree that we should quit, and I did not agree) I’ve been telling myself that I should see, I should realize how unhappy we are, and how it’s stupid to keep doing this just because we think it might get better. I mean, it’s so soon, and there haven’t been many times when it’s been really good. It’s been nice, at times, but not really good. Meanwhile, Circuit City is closing all of its stores, so I’m going to get the computer mailed back to me whenever it’s done being repaired. Where will I have it mailed to? I thought I knew where I was living and where I was going to live. I get homesick for the Valley, but it’s sad to imagine going back there with my tail between my legs when I don’t know if I still really have a friendship with Alix and Jonny is there but doesn’t return my messages since I saw him last. Familiar acquaintances can be a sight for sore eyes, but… you know. I’m getting to an age where, being sick of all this uncertainty, a move like that could be final… because I just want a steady job with insurance, and that’ll be something I want to hold onto if I ever find it. 40 Today was not a work day for me. I watched Obama’s inauguration, played some Guitar Hero, searched for a second job. Arden came home, and I ran out to buy bread and beer while she cooked veggie burgers. We watched The Nightmare Before Christmas with the commentary on, then she tracked down the appropriate channel for American Idol and we watched that. She’s asleep now. The cats get confused when she’s asleep but I’m out here. The door is closed to the bedroom because the lights are on out here. Each cat has his preferred spot on the bed, Secret next to her and Ted next to me. 41 I got home from work last night and Arden was asleep on the bed with the light on. I was peeing when Salma called. I said, “Hold on, I don’t want to wake Arden” and went out for a walk. I brought my paycheck to deposit at the ATM, which is a walkable distance away. After walking for a bit I sat down inside my car. Salma was talking about her parents, about some problems they’ve been going through. Arden texted while I was on the phone: “Are you coming home?” My response: “Yes. ” Arden: “Are you mad at me because you think I was mad at you this morning?” My response: “No. ” She was referring to how I had found her awake, having showered, at five in the morning. And I was being cuddly and affectionate, but she was on her way out. At the time, I had asked, “Do you have plans?” since it was a couple hours before her work shift began. “No,” she had said, “I’m going to go have a coffee at the diner. ” Cool with me, but odd. Before sleeping, she had clearly (I thought) been hoping that I would be just this way, assertively affectionate, but try as I might, I can’t make myself be the way she wants me to be at a moment like that. 42 A five hour conversation with Arden. I guess this is it. I guess things are over. I can’t even go into how it feels, here. The idea is now that I’ll go into my workplace tomorrow—even though I’m not scheduled to work—and ask them how soon it would be acceptable for me to leave. I hate this. Everything is uncertain. The conversation felt like a good and productive one, except that it was also ending it all. She had texted me during the day, saying that she wanted to talk when I got home, and that she had a proposal to make. That proposal, as it turned out, was vague, and more an appeal for me to either come right out and break things off with her or raise my spirits, somehow. She said that she would be willing to take a step back, to go back to a dynamic that would be a little less serious. After I listened to her talk about these things, she asked for my take. Eventually I came to the words, “I’m prepared for this to be over. ” Or it was something like that. Variations on the phrase sat on my tongue and then were swallowed back down several times before I finally made the statement. We care about each other. We do. She read selected bits from her old journals to me, at my request. Only bits she chose, though, and none of what she’s been writing recently. (In the past few days she has taken up writing in her old journal again, for the first time in years. ) People should be with people who make them feel that they’re a better person, right? I think I thought that Arden would do that for me. But everything that defines me, in mind, from my creativity to my humor to my compassionate understanding, I don’t know… it didn’t seem to register with her. I kept wanting to provoke something from her, some smile, some excitement… but it seemed like whatever I said, so much of the time, was an annoyance to her. And she was always wanting for me to say or do something different. Ugh. I don’t know who I am or where I belong or who my friends are or what I value in life. I’m sad, and Arden is behind the closed door of her bedroom. She asked me, after it seemed our conversation was done, and after she had brought my pillows to the couch (a new yellow couch, which I don’t like, which I thought she was joking about when she pointed it out to me at the thrift store), “Do you think you’re making a mistake?” about “quitting” us. I eventually said that I didn’t think I was making a mistake, but that I wanted to think so. Ted is on “my” desk, watching me write. I’m lying down on the couch, scratching messily into a little journal book. “So many times,” she said, “I’ve wished that I were Ted. ” “I ignore Ted a lot,” I said. And on and on and whatever for infinity. 43 Then, yesterday, I woke up to a note next to the computer that read, “I am really going to miss you. And I love you. ” She also had left out all the books belonging to me that had been in the bedroom. I was awake early, not understanding why I was up at such an hour, just after she had left for work, when I had been up until fairly late. I had said that I would go into my workplace and put in notice. She texted me to say that she was writing an email, and when she was finished it was a lengthy message about not wanting to let me go. I told her that I couldn’t bring myself to put in my notice that day. Maybe it was waking up to those sad tokens of the finality of it all. Then, after she was home, we started talking at length, and it was really and sadly a sort of dynamic where she was trying to convince me to stay, for us to try to start fresh, to “hit the reset button”. At least we were talking. It helped me feel less distant from her. I wanted to say that maybe this was just the wrong paradigm for us, this couple-living-together thing. And I did, actually—I said that. I said I thought we would have done better in any number of other circumstances that might have involved our spending a lot of time together. Like, if we were just dating, you know. And if I think this, isn’t that telling? Doesn’t this mean that whatever we may feel about each other, I don’t think the Relationship is worth it? I said to her that our Relationship, if you look at it as a thing unto itself, has never really reached any point of working well. Our ways of going about our lives together have not really improved things for either of us. And really, a good chunk of my brainpower in this past week or so has gone to asking myself, What next? It was so hard to think about, at first—hard to extract our continuing on together from thoughts of my future and survival—but as the days passed, and as I pushed myself to think in that way, I did it. I don’t know. All this back and forth in my mind. I’m always reacting to circumstances, trying to react inventively, but then circumstances change and I again start plotting a different course. I’m at work now. It’s a quiet day. Everyone stands up, to see over the walls of their cubicles. People talk and talk, but it’s not my scene at all, so I’m very much quiet. Hours pass and I take calls and in my mind I just want to find the impetus to get things rolling, to leave, to end the relationship. Don’t I care? Don’t I appreciate what it means to have someone dedicated to me? Someone I chose. Am I just unwilling? Unwilling to keep a relationship going? But what am I afraid of? Afraid to be a jerk. But I’m always afraid of that. I’ve been. Always trying not to be a jerk. Trying to do right. What about me? And what I want? But I can’t trust what I want. Why not? Because I throw myself into thing after thing and… and… Why does she have to want to stay with me so much? Want is the pursuit of a situation that is not yet one’s own. One cannot truly understand a situation that is not one’s own. Therefore, all want is the pursuit of what one does not understand. 44 The other day I got my first citation ever for not obeying traffic laws. It was for going 31 in a 15 mph school zone when school was in session (although the kids were, y’know, in school at the time. ) A second officer (a man), who came to I guess train the officer who had initially pulled me over (a woman) did the whole I-can-tell-that-you-do-drugs thing, which is still scary and additionally depressing when you don’t actually do drugs. He did the whole “would you have a problem with it if we searched the car, dogs and all” thing, and explained that the messiness of my car and the dark under my eyes were what tipped him off. He bragged about how he had been “at this a long time”. And today, well. Today I feel full of stress, jittery and nervous, sick of it all. 45 After work—me being weird and twitchy and nervous and wishing that people would not be over my shoulder all day—there was more talking with Arden. She’s just waiting for me to decide whether I stay or go. Isn’t that terrible? I hate that this is who I am. Then she goes to bed, leaving me on the couch with Ted. I think about locked doors and how essential they are to my feeling secure. Then I think back to my childhood, back to Sunset Drive, and how the door to my bedroom would always be unlocked by my mother or father when they wanted to talk to me. It was a quick thing, near instantaneous, when they did that, so they could come in at any time. I never knew when it was gonna happen. And that really bothered me. I’m sure it wouldn’t bother everyone, and I know that plenty of kids aren’t as demanding of personal space as I was. (Give it a rest you’re twenty-seven) (Why are you even writing this) (How immature) (Grow the fuck up) I said to Arden that I’m not sure I’m mature enough to know what I need in a lifestyle. I came here, to her place, just figuring, like, okay, I’ll live in this apartment as it is and just, we’ll figure out what we do day-to-day. I’ll have some closet space and yeah, I’ll just adjust. But my time isn’t my own, and when that’s the case it’s like I can’t be sure of anything that I feel. Most of my energy goes into reacting, to trying to act appropriately within the given situation and dynamic. Syrma, when I saw her recently at Haven, in Massachusetts. Hugged me, and goodness! It was like she was the same person, just the person I remembered. And Tingley talking about the serialized web comic he’s doing. And me putting quarters in the touch-screen game machine. And Alix telling me that now she can see how good I was to her… I wrote about that night, didn’t I? But I think it went away in the data loss, when I lost some of my writing. My computer, more than a month gone. Can’t afford. Need to increase income. Play it safe? But I see no safe option. 46 Arden’s glad that I’m trying to stick things out, but she knows. She knows, I guess, because I know, because I’ve been thinking so much about what I want, and because our communication has improved, that I really don’t think I’ll be happy here—won’t be happy here, and I don’t just mean in the long term that I wouldn’t be happy settling down here, but that I would, in continuing to try to stay here, just be a chronically unhappy person. Arden headed out today and hung out with Doug while I stayed home. I freaked out, belatedly I guess, at thinking how I’ve pretty much, after all that stuff of going back to school and getting my degree and researching careers and trying to find some way that I might become a professional anything, found myself staring at the obvious conclusion that I don’t have what it takes to make any career possibility work. There’s not much I can do except sit around and work stressful jobs and possibly have my credit destroyed… and hope that another job like the one I had at Providence Hospice of Seattle comes along. It would best for me to be somewhere I want to be while waiting for that to happen, I guess… 47 She came back from work. I was sitting at the computer, not busy with anything. I had been expecting her return and was only staring at the screen, half-reading some news article or something. She asked me how I was doing, walking towards me. My expression was still that of a walking-dead sort of depressed person. I tried to make up for my brokenness by putting my arm out for a hug. It felt nice. About a minute passed until, about to cry, she broke away. She went to the bathroom, blew her nose, then went to the bedroom and closed the door behind her. I knocked on the door and said that I was going out to “I don’t know where”. She said that if it was going to feel like this until I left, maybe then, at least, it would feel like a relief when I finally moved out. After driving around for about three quarters of an hour I finally remembered how to get to the local Burger King. Burger King, because they have Internet there. I texted before going back to the apartment. When she left the bedroom she avoided looking in my direction and didn’t say anything. I passed by her to start cooking veggie burgers in the kitchen. I stopped myself from asking whether she would like for me to make her one. Hours passed. She had long been asleep by the middle of the night, but I went outside for a cigarette break and, looking at the biggest accumulation of snow that I’ve seen in this part of PA this year (which still isn’t much at all) I thought to myself that I wanted to go to 7-11 and buy a Vitamin Water. I wasn’t wearing socks—just untied shoes, and the snow was falling into them—and I had to scrape off the car to go anywhere, but by myself, in the middle of the night, my following of this benign whim was what I had to remind me of the possibilities of life.

    "body": "48 I guess it’s over. I put in notice. Now I’m back at work, annoyed by laughter from the afternoon co-workers and angry cussing from the night shift ones. Always annoyed by people walking around and the fact that I’m seated in such a way as to place my back to everyone else. Then I’m more calm, strangely enough, back at the apartment. We sit down to watch 49 Up, the most recent in the ongoing series documenting the lives of people who were interviewed first at the age of seven, then every seven years after that. She went to bed midway through the movie. 49 Saturday, in the morning, before I leave for work, Arden takes off for her overnight stay in Connecticut. She and Min (her friend from Maine) are each driving—Arden driving north and Min driving south—to a designated hotel in Connecticut, where they can hang out and have some quality time. I work. I’ve had it requested by my work that I stay until Saturday, February 21st. I, of course, although I don’t want to stay that long, have agreed. I get to Massachusetts and instead of stopping in Chicopee just keep driving until Northampton. I have a glass of wine at the Basement and watch some karaoke at WWII (where the only person to say hello to me is a gal I met at Haven the last time I was in town). In the morning I go downstairs and have some coffee while sitting around with Mémé, Brenda, Dave, and Cheryl. Then I go to Best Buy in Holyoke and buy some RAM for my computer, which has been returned but which still cannot handle Windows Vista sufficiently (although it came installed with it). 50 I meet Julian in Northampton. It’s good to see him again. He eats at Teapot. I just get some hot tea. My fortune cookie tells me, “From now on your kindness will lead you to success”. I really hope this is true. I drive us to the Hampshire Mall, where we play a game of Dance Dance Revolution that about kills me. We each have a drink, and I have a pizza at a newly-opened place there in the mall that’s called Arizona Pizza. Back in Northampton I get a coffee at Haymarket, where we sit for a brief span of time. He declares that he has an idea about what we could do—we could go to a strip club. Okay, I say to him. I’ve never hung out in a strip club before. The only place like that I know how to get to is Anthony’s, in South Hadley. “Even after six years,” he says during the drive, “It’s still fun getting to know you again. ” Anthony’s is a nice space, but I decide that naked-lady dancing is silly. I drive us back to Northampton. Passing by the Elevens, I wonder what’s going on there, since there seem to be a lot of people in front. We go there, and it turns out that it’s night five of the Happy Valley Showdown, where bands are competing. Julian says of one performance, “This sounds like a middle school punk band. ” “Yeah,” I respond, “But it’s just what I was in the mood for. I don’t need to be impressed tonight; I just need to be rocked. ” Then there’s Charlie at the bar. He seems in a good mood, and he’s looking well. Later in the evening he sits down next to me and Julian and somehow gets to showing me all the pictures in his phone, of bands, his family, himself. Then it occurs to him that he wants something—I forget what—and I know that he’ll be off immediately to go get that thing. It’s like I said to Arden via text, the night before: I know that I can’t go back to living the same life I lived in my early twenties, but if I moved back here I couldn’t help but feel some desire to try. I’m getting lots of hugs from Julian. It’s nice. We exit the bar after he has taken a call from the person whose place he’s staying at; for one reason or another he’s at the Quality Inn, and that’s where I need to drop him off. Charlie is outside, and he tells me that I need to see his new place while I’m in town. He kisses me on the cheek and says he loves me, and as always, that feels like all I’ve ever wanted from the world. Strange, isn’t it? The small physical affections—the friendly ones—can feel as satisfying to me as the intense and romantic ones. Arden remembers most vividly our first kiss, while what I remember most is from before that, from Independence Day of 2007, when we cuddled out in the rain smoking cigarettes and touching each other’s hands. “This feels like practicing getting used to you not being here,” Arden texts me from home. 51 I was planning to leave early in the day, but I wanted to see Salma. We talked in the car, then went to the Northampton Brewery, then talked in the car some more. She of course wanted to be helpful, wanted to give some advice on how to save my relationship. Then I surprised Julian at Haven. He was very kind and affectionate. I had been there for a couple of hours, and we were in a corner with our arms around each other, and he said, “I love you… even when you’re crazy and neurotic. ” We talked about my being crazy. It was sad to think of myself as crazy, but somehow, hearing that made me want to stay with Arden, because maybe I really can’t figure out what I want, and maybe I never will, but I at least know that Arden loves me and has good intentions. It makes sense. I’m crazy, that’s all. Still, it’s sad to know that whatever I do, I won’t have Julian around. Yes, as much he had begun to make me feel uncomfortable, while I was still living in Massachusetts. He has been good to hang out with again. 52 Yesterday I was using Mapquest to approximate how I might travel this time, which route to take back to the Pacific Northwest. To Indiana, where I could crash with Julian and Heidi. A more southerly route this time, across Kansas. I’ve only ever set foot on that one piece of Kansas, the southeast corner, in 2002. Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, across Oregon—I haven’t seen most of it—and then to Portland, Seattle, wherever. Emailing further with James from the answering service job, giving him dates for when I “will be in Seattle” (really meaning, of course, “when I might be there, depending”. ) He says that going remote again would depend on stats, et cetera. Ahhhh… okay. Not really appealing. Doesn’t fit into my crazy idea of staying in Seattle for a couple of weeks and then heading south to Vancouver, Washington, from which I build myself a new life in good old, sexy Portland, Oregon. I emailed Tonya last night, too, caught up in thoughts of that region. She messaged me on Facebook a couple of months ago to ask about where I got that cabin. I told her that I had stayed in two different cabins while out there, actually, and gave her the names. She stayed in the less impressive location, Kitsap Memorial State Park. I messaged her last night and asked how that was. She said that yeah, the park was kind of lackluster. Yesterday involved me heading to Northampton, to Haymarket, where I met with Alice and her girlfriend, Renee. A lot has been going on with Alice, which has brought her back to Massachusetts, and she has been in touch with me, and talking to me about it all. But it’s not my situation to write about. Alice mentioned Jonny in conversation, and when I said that I hadn’t seen him (and that I was worried he was ignoring me) she texted him. He came and met us and we spent more time at Haymarket. I was going to go rollerskating with Julian (who at the time was hanging out in Amherst, at Worlds Apart Games, which is the new, volunteer-run reinvention of what was previously Phoenix Games)… but I was getting pains in my neck, and the day before I had been shocked by how much just one game of DDR seemed to shock my body. I went back to my mom’s and let myself lie down on the guest bed, and that was when I did all the mapquesting and emailed the old job. Then I met up with Julian at karaoke at Packards. I had a good time there. Kelsey was there, too, along with a guy named Josh who looked vaguely familiar and a gal named Berecca-ann, who I didn’t think I recognized. I sang “The Distance” by Cake. Then I dropped off Julian. I again slept soundly while leaving C-SPAN on the television. So, maybe I’ll just go to Oregon right off the bat. . 53 Feb. 16, 2009. Arden in Brooklyn. I’ve been applying for jobs not just in Portland, but in Seattle. I feel overwhelmingly depressed. There’s Arden, still wanting me to stay. Here’s me, doubting myself so much. Where can I be happy? Can I not be happy anywhere? Years wasted going to college. Now, I don’t know. I guess in the best case scenario I’ll charge some dental work before the financial reserves run out. What happens to me? Why can’t I stay here? I can’t be sure of myself. I want someone who can guide me. 54 Arden gets home and is as distant with me as a person in her position should be. But then, before long, we’re talking again, and then cuddled up talking, and she’s telling me that if I’m leaving this coming week I should do it on Sunday, because she doesn’t want to just come from home work and have me be gone… she wants to watch me drive away again. That will be harder for me, I told her. She said, You’re the one leaving me, and you can at least do that for me. Even by 4 in the morning I wasn’t ready to fall asleep. I pried myself away and went off to the couch. In the morning, after she had left for work, I moved back to the bed. I woke up with my shoulder hurting. I mailed off some more stuff that I sold on Amazon. Still no word on the medical bills. No early callbacks from the jobs out west I’ve applied to. And I’m always considering finding a way to stay. I think I just feel guilty for not enjoying spending all of my free time with her. As if her never quite saying we should break up means I owe it to her to stop feeling unhappy about what it’s like to actually be with her. But for so long it seemed like she was inviting me to leave… inviting me to prove to her mind that she was right all along and that she never could have kept me. 55 I got my official ‘F’ today from the Teaching Writing class, to go along with the three ‘A’s that I got in the other classes I took at Johns Hopkins. 56 Can you believe that the day has arrived, that I have turned in my card key at ICT, that I am scheduled to begin retraining at my old job in Seattle nine days from now, and that I still don’t know what I want to do? Can you believe that I still have the option to stay? Can you believe that I woke up hung over at 2 AM after falling asleep at 9:30 PM, and then later, with my head hurting and my stomach queasy, I was in bed around 5 AM with Arden, and I was just mumbling about how I’m not equipped to survive in this world. 57 I worked again. And ah, my neck is hurting me. But it is never an overwhelming pain, although it is sometimes (because it is in the neck) a scary pain. With Arden on vacation in Puerto Rico, I’m left to my own devices. I put off worrying about money, try to not stress out too much, because stress might just make my pain worse. 58 Mar. 4. North Wales, Pennsylvania. I didn’t leave. I did pack all my possessions in my car on Feb. 23. And I was outside of the apartment, and I handed the keys to Arden, and she was like, “Well?” And then I asked if I could come upstairs with her. And we talked, and I pretty much reached the conclusion that I’m crazy. After that, Arden went to Puerto Rico and had the best vacation ever. I called up my job and asked to come back, and they had no problems with that, especially seeing as how, for reasons I won’t bother to go into here, there has lately been a much higher call volume than the center has been able to effectively handle. Work, while she was away, was so bad that I could barely process the passing of time, except by my increasing neck pain. We saw Ani DiFranco last night, and it was a good time. I think Tyler and I have been enjoying each other’s company. I want to keep my cool and not freak out, not get carried away by my sadness. I want to be good to her. 59 Bad news: My current workplace is being shut down. Good news: We can keep our jobs, though. The call center is just being moved to a pre-existing building. More bad news: My work is currently about a thirty minute drive from where I live. The new location is more like seventy-five minutes away. More good news: I have an interview on Monday with a different company. This position, while still not glamorous or lucrative, sounds less stressful (does not involve phones) and is nearby. More bad news: The job is for “at least 4 to 8 weeks but we hope it can be permanent, we’re still waiting to hear”. All things considered, though, if I’m offered the new job, I’m pretty sure that I’ll take it. For one thing, the legitimate excuse to leave the old job is too good an opportunity to turn down. 60 Off from work today. Soon after I woke up, Salma gave me a call. She seemed to be in a particularly dismal frame of mind. As always, I can only hope that my listening was helpful. I always like talking to her. I then did some managing of the finances, some cleaning, and before I knew it, Arden was home from work and inviting me out with her and Doug and someone from work. Out to a local pub. They had a Wii there, set up with Wii Sports, and we were playing that for awhile. Then, a phone call from Marie. She moved back to Massachusetts from Arizona, and she wanted to share her excitement about being published for the first time in a national literary journal. Considering that this was the stated impetus for her call, I probably shouldn’t have said, about my own literary pursuits, “Yeah, I’ve been writing, but I haven’t wanted to bother to publish, since nobody reads, anyway. ” Way to thoughtlessly belittle your friend’s accomplishment, Levi! The job that I was planning to take has not called me back. Oh, well. Oh, well. 61 At work today, I started feeling horrifically trapped in an absurd and oppressive world. Then it occurred to me that I had been reading Kafka all day between phone calls, which probably wasn’t helping. 62 Mar. 23, 2009. Yesterday was a classic Levi comedy of errors: after work I planned to rent a motel room and to stay there for the rest of the weekend so that I could write (and organize old writings) in happy solitude. I had picked out the Motel 6 in New Castle, Delaware because it was the cheapest place I could find within reasonable driving distance. Problem is, once I was there, as I was checking in I asked, “Oh, is there an extra charge to use the wireless?” “We don’t have wireless,” the guy at the counter replied, “We have data ports. ” “Do you have wires to lend out for the data ports?” I asked. “No, sorry. ” Then I asked him if there would be any fees for backing out at this point. Mumbling obscenities under his breath, he said that he could give me a refund if I wanted. Frustratingly, there was a new system in place, so he had to call up the technical helpline to get someone to explain to him how to issue a refund for a credit card. That took a really long time—like twenty minutes in the motel office. Then I went to the place across the street and they said that they had Internet but it didn’t actually work. And I went through three different rooms before giving up and saying that I wasn’t going to stay there. (I was being reminded, anyway, of the paper thin walls and high occupancy rates that tend to make cheap motels in close proximity to metropolitan areas less than ideal for a solitary writing retreat. I should have learned this lesson while trying out different lodgings in the D. C. area, but, yeah, I forgot. ) But then I came home and Doug and Kelly, the woman he’s dating, were over. Arden had set up cheese and crackers and there was much white wine to be consumed. We played Scrabble and I kicked everyone’s ass. Oh, and Kelly’s dog was over, too. I forget the dog’s name, but she was wonderful. 63 And I’ve been feeling better. Going through the Life Story as it stands now. I got distracted for, you know, months and months, from the process of polishing and tightening what I’ve collected. I’ve also recently worked miracles on my music collection, which I’ll have better access to as of (probably) tomorrow evening, since Arden has ordered a new iPod for herself and I have thrown a hundred dollars at her in exchange for the one she has been using (which is 30gig, and truly functional, unlike the one I bought on Ebay a few months ago. ) Strangely enough, I find as I go through the older volumes of this work that it helps my self-esteem to see myself being witty and having understandable reactions to various circumstances. Going back to the old journal entries, this time, is reminding me that I deserve to be liked. It makes me wonder if I would be liable to lose my respect for myself entirely if I didn’t have this sort of record of what I’ve had to say about my life. 64 Newtown, Pennsylvania. My second day at the new location for the call center. As much as I’m used to dressing up in office costume, now, it does still sort of humiliate me. There is no power in dressing to impress when what you do all day is not in any way affected by how you look. As simple as the look is to achieve, it’s a reminder that what I’m being paid for is obsequiousness: if I refused to make myself look as if I want to be the sort of businessman who would frown on having a call center staffed by people in tee shirts and jeans (or worse, a range of individual styles representing the diversity of individual tastes in America) I would not be worth the eleven dollars per hour that I currently earn.

    "body": "65 Arden and I go to Philly and see Efterklang at the First Unitarian Church. It’s a good time. Then, on the way home, after I’ve talked about what seems to be my dismal future, and how it seems that I am doomed never to be able to support myself in this lifetime… Me: “I’m sorry… No. No, I’m not sorry. There’s no reason why I should feel sorry for talking about that. ” Her: “Why would you say you’re sorry?” Me: “Because I feel like you don’t want to hear it. ” Her: “Why would you think that?” Me: “I guess it seems like you get annoyed when I talk about these things. ” Her: “Well, I’m annoyed that you would say that. ” And then the topic is changed to her feeling annoyed and hurt by my suggesting that she didn’t want to hear me talk about difficult and stressful things. 66 Which is to say that when I need her, emotionally, I end up feeling guilty for having feelings. And when I’m in a good mood and she’s in a bad mood—as happened on our ride to Philly, after I commented aloud that Oh yeah, I forgot how blind I am, driving at night without contact lenses or glasses, and she insisted on taking over driving there, although she hates driving in Philly—it strikes me how reluctant she is to acknowledge the mood she has fallen into, even as she appears to be biting her lip to stop from making spiteful comments or, just as often, is making spiteful comments. I’m learning that the safe topics are music, television shows, anything that does not involve us or who we are or what we want out of life or what we could do to try to cherish and make the best of our limited time on this Earth. But also, she’s pretty much the only person in my life. Who can live up to that role? 67 And at work I’m back to wishing that I had somewhere to go after my shift that would feel safe. It makes me feel sick, of course, and that feeling of anxiety comes back. I text my mom, and then Arden, saying that I’m thinking about driving up to Massachusetts for the next couple days. Back at the apartment, I hug Arden. She asks me how I’m doing. “I’m depressed and want to nap,” I say. There is a bit more talk as I pour a glass of water. Inevitably (because I am too worn down to feign contentedness) she asks, “Are you angry at me?” “No. I’m depressed and want to nap. ” I pull down the covers on the bed and lie down. I hear her crying. Then I hear her in the bathroom, still crying. I hear the shower running. Then I hear her leave the apartment. Then I nap. I wake up, I don’t know, maybe an hour and a half later. I check out the iPod that I’ve inherited from her. She has very thoughtfully pre-loaded it with music from her collection that she knows I like, or that I gave to her, or that she thinks I might like. I plug the iPod in to my computer for the first time and it works great. I load a few albums on it from there. Arden gets home. She goes immediately into the bedroom and shuts the door. 68 After my mom has been saying, “You know, if you don’t like it down there, just come back, stay here, look for work…” and I have seen no friends (although I did by coincidence receive a call from Charlie, who just needed directions because he was arriving by bus in New York and wanted walking directions, going to see The Dead, a free show they were doing that he had procured tickets for) I make the long drive back to Pennsylvania. In the span of time between my leaving on Saturday and this (Monday) afternoon, Arden and I haven’t texted at all. Arden is still awake when I return, in bed reading. We talk a little, although it keeps going back to her staring at me and saying nothing, which makes me uncomfortable. (Me: “Would you like me to leave so you can get to bed?” She: “No. ” Then the staring resumes. ) “Do you still want to be with me?” she asks. I conspicuously avoid answering. I hang out in the living room, watching some more of the DVD set of season 2 of The Riches. Later, I join Arden in bed. As I crawl in, she gets out. At first, I think this is her being uncomfortable, or angry, or whatever—I think she’s trying to get away from me, objecting to my getting into bed—and I jump back out and grab my clothes and say, “Sorry, I’ll go!” until she tells me that she’s just going to use the bathroom and that then she’ll be coming right back to bed. 69 I think I’m going to nap, as I have found myself napping in recent times, after work. The day shift does that to me, I suppose, and Arden makes this very observation to me as I lie down. It sounds to me like she’s saying that I shouldn’t work days. I’m so weird about what she says to me, because it doesn’t seem like she volunteers opinions or suggestions very much, and when she does I feel like there must be some meaning concealed in it. Instead of napping, though, I end up watching American Idol with her. Then she says, “I’m going to bed,” and goes to bed, and I just stretch out on the couch. When I wake up it’s like 4 AM, and I join the sleeping Arden in bed. It would do no good to be in the living room in the morning while she was getting ready for work: she wouldn’t like that at all. 70 The next morning, I remember to bring my laptop with me when I leave for work. It’s an average-to-busy day. I put in my notice again. 71 Then I’m in Princeton, New Jersey, because I noticed that it was only about a half hour from my workplace in Newtown, and you know me and college towns. I spend some time with my laptop at Small World Coffee. 72 That night, Arden heads off to the bedroom early. I hear her crying, and eventually I can’t stand not going in there. I open the door. She has the Tindersticks playing at low volume on her stereo. I ask: would be better for her if I don’t enter right now? She says she doesn’t know. With things feeling distant between us, it makes her feel more pessimistic about everything else in her life. That’s what she tells me as I sit on the floor next to the bed, as Ted climbs and nuzzles and attacks. Am I thinking that we should give up? she asks. I don’t say yes, of course, not in so many words. But it does come out. I don’t tell her that I’ve already put in my notice. She asks me when I’m going to leave and I say probably in a few weeks, like two and a half weeks maybe. And she asks if I’ll put in my notice on Friday and I say that yes I will. Our talking about the music leads to discussion of vocalists and I end up putting on CocoRosie’s Noah’s Ark for her. She hasn’t heard them before. She has pulled out her pack of Djarum clove cigarettes and is uncharacteristically smoking in the bedroom. (She doesn’t smoke often. She’ll stop completely for months, then begin smoking more regularly, then mostly-stop, and so on. Cloves are something she rediscovered only when Alice was staying with us briefly, Alice who only smokes cloves. I didn’t write about that period of time. ) But anyway. The hour is getting late. We’re in bed and she’s talking and she’s saying, “See, I sucked the life out of you again,” and I can’t just say, “No, it’s not you, I’m just tired,” because she’s not just making up what she’s saying, there is a truth in it… some of these talks, talks not leading anywhere, when there isn’t a point that she’s trying to clarify, when I can ask what she needs or what she wants and she doesn’t know, isn’t asking anything, because she’s not one to ask for anything, but it doesn’t just seem like her venting, either, because she’s looking for participation, but my participation just causes problems, my participation just leads to me saying things which, for reasons I find difficult to understand and impossible to predict, hurt her. But of course this is hard for her… 73 I have Thursday off. I spend it organizing my music collection. I also find out that my charity application has been processed and that the entirety of my $7,650 hospital bill has been covered. Arden comes home. She seems distraught around me. I’m nervous negotiating my way around the kitchen with her here, and then I’m even more nervous than usual about cooking for myself, like, Crap, no, I don’t remember which mixing bowl she would want me to use and so I order pizza and we watch the last episode of The Riches that aired before the show was canceled. Then something happens, and we’re offending each other, and I’m about to leave to spend whatever time might still be had at whatever coffee shop type place, but she’s saying, “And then you always just go,” and I don’t understand, I don’t think I often do that, but I’m not going to argue, don’t see any need to, but she’s wanting me to stay, and I know it’s just going to be me trying to say little—because my point of view is bound to conflict irreconcilably with hers and will probably hurt her and cause me to feel like I’m lacking a basic human decency—and yet also attempting not to stay so silent that it makes her feel like she is, as she says, “too emotional” and “below me”. Meanwhile I feel like my emotions must be invisible to her, or must appear like something other than emotions to her. Maybe because I’m so scared all the time, feeling scolded for how I act. Or because her verbal jabs pierce me too much. Or maybe I don’t really see her emotions, either, since I don’t think of her as particularly emotional… In any case, I have to stay, and I feel trapped in the conversation. It’s not that I’m being invited to share or open up and that I would rather walk out; it’s that it would hurt her too much to see me leave at this moment. But I don’t even really want to leave, exactly, so much as I wish that we could avoid this sort of exchange, which will have no central point, which will involve her saying a lot of things, none of which I will know how to respond to, and eventually I will, yes, feel drained by it all and she will then tell me to feel free to do whatever I feel like, after I’ve thrown myself down onto the couch. I will say, “Lying on the couch is about all that I’m up to at the moment. ” Then she will go to bed and I will organize music and writings, and I will write in this. 74 I’ve reinstated my subscription to eMusic, which which allows a certain number of music downloads for a monthly fee (and then charges ninety-nine cents or whatever for downloads over the limit. ) I found the Primate Fiasco on there—Dave Russo’s current band. I find myself trying to get re-inspired in advance by the Pioneer Valley. And the album’s good; it even includes a re-working of one of Dave’s songs, “Demon”, which is old enough that he played it at the show at Holyoke Community College where I sang and played guitar in public for the first time. And it’s rainy. And I know that Diane is coming down from New York; she and Arden and Doug and Kelly are going to see Ray Lamontagne in Philly tomorrow. I’m pretty sure Arden wants me not to be around this weekend. If my reading of the web sites for Massachusetts’ state-subsidized health care plans is correct, I might actually be able to not be afraid of occasionally seeing medical professionals, living there. I’m also tempted to think of alternatives, you know, like heading back west, now that I don’t have that gigantic medical bill to worry about. 75 Even though the night before did not involve a whole lot of sleep for me, I stay up late on Friday. Arden and Diane are staying the night at Doug’s. With my music collection successfully organized, I go through the task of burning everything onto DVD-R backups. I continue plugging away, then, at the Life Story. I might actually have that all edited and hardcover-worthy by the time I leave Pennsylvania. I get to work an hour late. In general I never can recall the actual process of my waking up for work, so it’s hard to say what went wrong, but I do remember getting out of bed and thinking that it was an hour earlier than it actually was. Work is so-so. I’ve tossed my laptop and a bag of clean laundry into the car, so after work I just drive into New Jersey, through Princeton, towards Raritan, where by means of the Internet I have selected a hotel. (Hopefully this will go better than did my attempted stay in Delaware. ) A Friendly’s tempts me off the road—I’m quite hungry—but then I’m distracted even from this distraction, shopping first at the liquor store (for a bottle of wine) and then at a half-price book store. (I somehow emerge from the latter establishment without any books in my hand, although there was plenty of stuff in there that I would like to read. ) Then I go to Friendly’s, where I eat a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. 76 Alone time in the motel room is good. The Internet works—yay, New Jersey! Shame on you, Delaware!—and the hours just disappear while I read/edit. 77 In the morning I notify the office at the Super 8 Motel that I’ll be keeping my room for another night. This is going well. I spend the vast majority of my time editing the Life Story, putting final (or “final”) polishes on sections written between 2003-2006. It is really quite moving, whenever I do this, reliving my past sequentially. It makes me feel at though, in the process, I’m doing something important and good for my sense of self. 78 PJ’s Pancake House, Princeton, New Jersey. I was late for work today by three and a half hours… but nobody said anything about it, which was nice. I chatted with Helena online. What drives me to message people after so long?… As usual, she told me to move to New York. Truth be told, that led me to consider doing so; I was thinking about it today… but I figure you really need to be in love with the mystique of New York in order to happily pack up and set yourself down there, the way I would have to do it.

    "body": "79 THURSDAY, I wake up after not getting much sleep. I arrive at work at something resembling my scheduled start time. About halfway through the shift I start to feel tired, but somehow in my last hour there I’m not feeling so bad. Arden has suggested via text that we go out and grab some food tonight. I’m like, well, maybe, depending what my eyelids have to say on the matter. Rapidly my twenty-eighth birthday is approaching. All things considered, I am glad that I have survived this long. Also today: I finish rereading Plexus by Henry Miller (which I began reading in Seattle) and realize that I (accidentally) did not bring any more books with me. So, on a break, I run out to my car and sift through the stuff in my trunk. The only book I find is a collection of writings by Slavoj Žižek. I find that my birth certificate has been hiding in this book, folded in thirds, serving as a bookmark for it. Also today: a veggie burger and fries for lunch at the little cafeteria area that’s inside this building. In the evening there is food at the Clubhouse Too (formerly known as the Astor, which is what Arden still calls it. ) I arrive first. In the bathroom I pee, and I get depressed while looking in the mirror. (It’s my hair, partially, but mostly my gut. I have gained so much weight. I’m in a down mood when Arden arrives, but at least I don’t end up ruining the night for us. ) After eating, the two of us sit for a spell in the smoking area. I ask: “If I didn’t have any opinion on the matter, where would you say that I should live?” I don’t think she likes this sort of question, but she says something along the lines of, “Well, western Mass is where you know people, and where you know that the local culture is something that you… approve of. Then there’s Oregon, which you’ve felt drawn to for a long time. It’s pretty easy to narrow it down to those two places. ” “Yeah. I am reconsidering Oregon, actually. ” “Really. ” She goes on to say that she worries about me, that there’s a certain maternal… (then she stops herself and tries to rephrase it) a feeling that she wants to take care of me, or to see me taken care of… and there was something reassuring in the thought that, even though our being together wasn’t working out and I was going away, I wasn’t going to have that huge medical bill hanging over my head, and I was going to be in Massachusetts, around family. I say that I think Oregon would give me a better chance to spend my days being an artist, doing creative things. She says that on the other hand, Massachusetts might give me a better chance to get on my feet. “Yeah,” I say, “But on my feet, I mean…” I don’t actually manage to come up with the words for what I want to say, but what I want to say is that getting on your feet doesn’t count for much if where you’re standing, then, is on the other side of a waterfall from where you’re determined to be. What the hell is so wrong with the idea of going back to western Massachusetts? you might ask. Well… I would have so little to work with there, I feel like. A lack of industry in the area; planning to move back, I kept finding myself having to look at job listings in Hartford and Worcester, and what’s the point, then? So what I’m thinking is, you know, I’m going to be twenty-eight years old. I’ve learned some life skills; I know some things about moving, about cities, about job-hunting, about money. I also have stomach ulcers and debt, it’s true. And Massachusetts is the only place I could go and know that I would have medical coverage. But for the moment I have the option to pick up and go, to pick up and begin. And I want to take advantage of that opportunity. There are, after all, no guarantees about the future, no matter what. I go to sleep as soon as we get home from the Clubhouse. So does Arden. We’re still sharing the bed. FRIDAY at work, I work. I’ve been given a more full schedule this week; the past few weeks, I’ve sort of been getting not as many hours as I would prefer. Arden and I have tickets to see Cloud Cult opening for Margot and the Nuclear So and Sos in the basement of the First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia. I kind of have to rush after work, because even though I now work twice as far away from the apartment as I used to—in Newtown rather than Horsham—there is still nowhere along my usual route to stop and get gas or food, and so I have to take a detour just to find some McDonald’s. Then we’re on the light rail, the R5 into the city. The woman going seat to seat to sell and validate ride tickets seems not entirely present, and she’s laughing at her inability to remember what zone we’re in and how much change to give for a twenty. “That’s the sort of day I’ve been having, too,” I say to her, although in my case I think I blame a work shift (which would be mind-numbing enough on its own) spent reading, between calls, Martin Amis’s Other People, about a woman who wakes up and is hurried out from a hospital with an impossible degree of amnesia, such that she fails to recognize not only herself but even the basics of civilization. Reading at work is funny. That’s a perk that I’ll miss if (as is likely) I don’t have it at my next job. Even just being on the rail I feel more at home among the passengers than I’ve been feeling at work, or in public in and around North Wales. Why is that? The diversity seems to comfort me. The dangers of the city intimidated me when I moved there two years ago—(It really doesn’t feel like it was that long ago)—but now, all things considered, the city is beginning to feel comfortable to me. We arrive, later even than the start time listed on our tickets, but the line is still waiting, with no one having been let in yet. The first opening act, whoever they are, have to play while everyone is still working their way inside. Cloud Cult plays next. They’re quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. Margot and the Nuclear So and Sos play last; they’re good, but they’re no Cloud Cult. At Suburban Station we sit down to wait for the train. I see that someone has left their program from an ongoing production of Edward Albee’s At Home at the Zoo. That’s right, I had heard on the radio that that was going on, but it must have been just before the last time I thought that I was moving away from Pennsylvania forever. When’s the last time I saw a play? It must have been that show in western Mass that I saw with Alix, when she needed to see it for a class… the play that Kevin Barry Crowley, from my HCC days, coincidentally was acting in. I think that happened more recently than the production of Emma, the play by Howard Zinn about Emma Goldman, which Alyson played the lead in… or maybe, actually, Emma was the more recent of the two. Whatever. In any case, I don’t see nearly as many plays as I would like to see. So much art, so much happening in the world, that I can forget what I know about and am inspired by. There is not, and hardly could be, enough time for me to satisfy all of my interests. SATURDAY I wake up to Arden making pancakes. She also has filled my on-the-go coffee Thermos—(is Thermos an outdated term?)—with coffee. I thank her, eat, become caffeinated, then try to think of and collect all the things that I should have with me when I leave to drive to Massachusetts for Easter weekend after my (shorter than usual) shift at work. Arden kisses me and says that she loves me. I lug my stuff down the stairs. I drive through a rainy morning. Back in my cubicle. Jeans are okay to wear on Saturdays, but I don’t have any clean and anyway, I don’t necessarily prefer them to my “dressier” (not-jean) pants, so I’m just wearing the same pair of pants that I’ve been wearing for the past two days. I check my work email and see the schedule for next week; Friday will be my last day. I’m more nervous about telling people that I’m moving to Portland than I am nervous about actually moving there. Although I am, when it comes down to it, afraid about my health and the potential costs of trying to preserve it. That’s why I was thinking about returning to Massachusetts, and that will be why I return, if I do return. Today, with my stomach not always feeling great, I worry that this might be the best option. Traffic sucks ass at several points in New York and Connecticut. It’s weird how a long drive can wear you out. I arrive at my mom’s place. She and Bruce are watching E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial on television. I call Salma. I leave a voicemail along the lines of: “I suspect that you’re away, but I’m in town through Monday, so feel free to give me a call, and let me know if you might be available. ” I also call Alice, who answers the phone in her new apartment. She suggests meeting up at some point tomorrow when I’m done with family things. I call Alix and leave a message; she calls me back a few minutes later from Brattleboro, Vermont. “What are you doing in Brattleboro?” I ask. “Eating a chicken salad,” she says. “They must have some pretty awesome chicken salad in Brattleboro, if you drove there just for that. ” She suggests that we get some coffee on Monday. I say sure, I’ll get in touch either tomorrow night or on Monday about that. SUNDAY is Easter. Family family family, then up through Holyoke, up I-91 to Northampton. I pick up Salma, because Johnny is using her car. Park downtown. Walking on a day the wind makes cold, to Packards. Sitting in the back room there. Salma talks about being vegetarian. I’m telling her how for the most part I’ve been avoiding meat again, how I don’t feel much temptation to eat it but still do end up, like, eating fast food when I’m in a hurry and don’t want to go without a meal, when I know I won’t have any other chance to eat something substantial. She has been feeling like she’s not so sure anymore about any philosophical reasons she might have once had for staying vegetarian… that’s she is almost tempted to eat meat because that’s what humans have doing forever, it’s in our nature, that’s who and what we are. I say that trying to limit my diet is a way for me to keep myself thinking about what I put inside me, and say that I would guess there aren’t any serious long-term negatives to a properly considered vegetarian diet, since, with vegetarianism being a sort of against-the-grain lifestyle choice, I would expect any common, unavoidable negative side effects to be reported and exaggerated by the media and word of mouth until the sound bites would be quoted incessantly by every vegetarian’s obnoxious young brother as a reason why everyone should eat big slabs of beef. We go to Hugo’s next, then, because I have a lot of memories of sitting and chatting with Salma at Hugo’s. The place is quite empty… but then, it is Easter Sunday after all, and the streets in general are underpopulated for the day. Salma has a limited amount of time to devote to hangings out—Johnny gets home at 8:30—but of course it’s about an hour later than that when, after we’ve talked about relationships and medical bills and where I’m thinking I might move to, I drive back towards her place. She goes, “Is it okay if I ask you to pull into the complex before mine, and to drop me off there, and I’ll walk?” “Sure,” I say, “Although it does make a little sad to have to do that. ” (To have to do that still, especially: clandestine friend-dates?) I call Alice. She has moved into temporary assisted housing (although that means up to two years). I find the apartment. Her roommate (who is there on a permanent basis) is on the couch with her boyfriend, watching a movie. Alice’s room is cozy. A nice bed was there when she moved in; she has hanging on the wall some old paintings, and old “witches’ boots”—a pair of them, each looking itself like two boots stitched together, front to back, with pointed toes. In the kitchen, a fridge with probably more poetry magnets than I have ever seen on any one fridge, which is saying something. I’m informed that she’s not allowed to have visitors this late, although her roommate is, and that I am therefore visiting as a guest of her roommate. But she can come and go as she pleases, so I suggest that we head out somewhere, saying that I’ll buy her a drink. Into the Dirty Truth, where I choose from the epic lineup of beers on tap a Geary’s, which is a beer from Maine that I know because I know Arden. Alice has a glass of Merlot. (“The pressures of the dominant culture are always there, lurking behind the conversations,” I will write the next morning, just after waking up, still lying in bed, thinking about what I will write in my journaling about the night. ) Alice says I should expect her coming to me for pointers about picking up and moving out of state. I say that I would be glad to help, that I wish I could be of more assistance in general; she says, though, that my and Arden’s letting her stay with us late last year was a huge help: “Why do you think I was cleaning your apartment all the time? You really helped me a lot. ” On Jonny: “He has a girlfriend. ” Of course, as a result, he would not have time for anyone. I have not tried to contact him since being in town. Again I have texted him a couple of times from Philly without response. Alice and I have some amusing banter about ketchup and mayonnaise, then I drop her off and go home. MONDAY I wake up in the afternoon and drive to Alix’s place in Northampton. From there we walk into town and to Haymarket. I find I’m not saying much. I’m just not about to talk to her about deeply personal thoughts, I guess. I’m more guarded than my old self, the Levi she dated, was. The chiropractor she’s currently seeing comes by, then leaves. Alix says she wants to move away, now, maybe to Vermont with the chiropractor. They’ve been driving up there and checking out different small towns. (She’s selling her services these days as a digital marketing consultant, or something like that. ) We go back to her place, where first she’s playing guitar, then she’s looking for the fuse box because some of the outlets have stopped working. Then she’s boiling water for pasta. Then she’s forgetting about the water she’s boiling, busy going through files on her computer. Driving south back to Pennyslvania, I stop at one of the rest stops along the New Jersey Turnpike. The guy at the Roy Rogers claims to remember me from my stopping there before. I’m most likely leaving for Portland this weekend. I didn’t mention it to my mom. The closest I got to suggesting that I might not come back home—(and she doesn’t know that I put in my notice at work)—was after she said to me again, “You can always come up here. You know where I’ll be. ” To which I responded: “Thanks. You don’t know where I’ll be. ” And we had a laugh. Then I stepped out the door. TUESDAY Arden wakes me up, knowing that I didn’t get much sleep. She says that she’s leaving for work and advises me to get out of bed. After another day of work, my ankle is hurting. I’m on the couch with Arden. We watch the movie Old Joy, which I really enjoy. It takes place in and around Portland, Oregon. Any admirer of the Pacific Northwest would have a hard time keeping their eyes off the screen, with that movie playing. Is any place more beautiful? "

    "body": "1 Arden helped me pack my things and get everything in the car. She didn’t see me off this time, didn’t watch me drive off, and I think this was yet another of her parting gifts to me. I didn’t stop at many rest stops. I just kept driving. I wondered how to handle my continuing impulses to text message her. I wanted to give her status updates, and I did sometimes. I drove the length of Pennsylvania, crossed Ohio, took a highway exit in Indianapolis, then parked the car in Plainfield. Julian stood outside the place where he was living with Heidi. I hugged him, then followed him inside, carrying my laptop case and maybe my toiletries. Heidi was there in the living room, along with a friend named Carissa, who has been living there. Carissa’s six-year-old son, Timmy, was there, too. It was a nice environment to step into, good people all around. We stayed up late and played a game of Monopoly. It came down to me and Carissa in the end, but Carissa won. I had never been any good at the game before, but I found that all the thinking about money I had subjected myself to in recent years was translating well to building up houses and bouncing a thimble across a board. Heidi left for class in the morning, and Timmy was up and about, so then I was awake, too. The others rose shortly thereafter. Timmy liked Guitar Hero, so there was a lot of that. Then Heidi was back, and we were trying to go to the zoo, and we were at the zoo but they were closing, so then we were at a toy store on Massachusetts Avenue in Indianapolis. I was talked into staying for another day. Heidi took out some of the religious books that were lying around, and so I was turning the pages while Timmy asked, “What’s that?” about each of the pictures. Then we were off to try the zoo again. We were successful this time. I decided that I like rhinoceroses. Back to the house, where Julian and I nodded off on each other while Between the Lions, a children’s show, played on the television. Tuesday was also the night of the weekly karaoke at The Metro, a gay bar in Indianapolis. At first, after we arrived, I was unhappy, because there were no tables open and we were all just standing against the wall. Then I was satisfied, because a table opened up. Then I remembered that it would shortly be my birthday and that I would be twenty-eight years old. Then I was twenty-eight years old. In the morning, Julian walked into the living room, dressed in his bathrobe, and knelt down to make sure that he could say goodbye to me before I left. Then he went back to bed, and I left, and I drove I-70 across the rest of Indiana, and into and out from Illinois, and across Missouri until I decided that I wanted to get my room for the night a little earlier than planned. I stopped at a Budget Inn just past the city limits of Columbia. I hadn’t checked my email since Saturday; it was now Wednesday. I still hadn’t told my mom that I was moving to Portland; I still didn’t feel confident enough to want to say it to anyone. A part of me still expected to turn back around, to come up with a better idea, to quickly formulate a more reasonable foundation for the rest of my life. The best explanation for my actions I was coming up with was to call this a reboot, a new beginning, a starting over from scratch. There was a romance to the idea, something wonderfully American about it, and even though I was actually pretty well done with the romance of that idea by this point in my life, I felt that maybe I should cling to it and at least try to be excited by it. I would need to explain to people why I made this move, after all, and it would be better to have them think of me as a bold adventurer than as a crazy person. (While I was in Indiana, Julian called me crazy again; it hurt and deflated me once more. ) There I was, then, in a room in Missouri, without a clear place lined up for myself in Portland, and without a job waiting for me, and feeling sad and disappointed about leaving Arden. I applied to one Portland-area job and bookmarked several others. After checking out in the morning I drove 70 miles before noticing that I could no longer find my cell phone. I turned around and went back to the motel, where the cleaning lady handed it back to me. My latest check on the amount of oil in my car had appeared inconclusive, and I had not had an oil change for about 4,000 miles, so I decided also to stop at a Jiffy Lube before leaving Columbia again. It was therefore about two in the afternoon before my movement westward began in earnest. I passed through Kansas City. At a gas station I called up the number for an extended stay hotel in Beaverton, Oregon that I had seen advertising a heavily discounted monthly rate on Craigslist. I made a reservation. I continued on I-70 into Kansas. I stayed the night in Colby, then drove into Colorado, bypassed Denver, went up I-25 and then caught I-80 West in Cheyenne. My second-to-last place to sleep before arriving in the Portland area was Rock Springs, Wyoming. I didn’t sleep very well that night. In the morning I found that snow had fallen and had shifted the colors of the mountain scenery. The roads were clear, however, and the accumulation on my windshield was nothing that a few swishes of the wipers couldn’t fix. Weather. com claimed the outside temperature was 34 degrees, but when I stepped outside sans jacket it didn’t feel all that cold. Back on the highway, I listened to podcasts and continued to drive west. I was, it then seemed, driving into storm clouds. There was snow falling. This lasted a while but ended, more or less, when I passed into Utah. It felt really… something… to be leaving the Rockies in such a dramatic way. This was when I felt that I had returned to my West, my contemporary West, a place that had nothing to do with cowboys but something to do with a difference in the air, a difference in how it felt to be alive. Entering Oregon felt great when I finally got there. My feelings of uncertainty seemed to be fading away. This is my new home state, I thought to myself. My motel room was just across the border, in the city of Ontario. It was sixty degrees and windy, but that felt perfect to me. Even this far from the ocean I was still in Oregon, and I thought of myself as being on the west coast now, and the woman handling check-in at the motel seemed cool. “Adams… Levi?” “Yes. ” “There you are. Free night from rewards points. ” “Yes. I’m the one who doesn’t have to pay. ” “I wish I were the one who doesn’t have to pay. ” She then hurried outside, just behind me, to have a cigarette. I brought my things inside the room, but quickly decided that I wanted some coffee. I stepped inside a coffee shop across the street and was immediately comfortable. My new home. Oregon. Oregon. Say it with me… just be sure to pronounce it correctly. 2 Salma told me over the phone, “I broke up with Johnny,” but then she had another call coming in and asked if she could call me back. I said sure. I had just met up with the Columbia River. She called back and I pulled off the highway to some unpaved road. There was space for me to park the car and no traffic, so I turned off the ignition while continuing to talk. I stepped outside. I noticed the seagulls. I was close to the water. She was babysitting while on the phone, and due to a diaper emergency or somesuch needed again to end the call. She would call again in a few hours, she said. Okay, I said. I drove on the highway through Portland, reached Beaverton, signed and paid for a month’s stay ($799) and brought all my things inside. I had done it. I had plopped myself down in Oregon with a roof over my head and some money to subsist on. I messaged several people on OKCupid. I joined the damnportlanders community on LiveJournal. I saw a listing for an open mic that was happening at the White Owl in Portland, and I went to that and enjoyed it muchly. There was so much I could be doing! Yay! And I could walk the streets without feeling like I stood out as a weirdo! So I went to Coffee Time and wrote and then walked around that area (flower petals all on the sidewalks) for a bit before heading back to my hotel-home. The next morning I got a call back from ACS, a call center. I scheduled an interview/testing/whatever with them for the following day. I also filled in a gazillion and a half required forms online. News outlets were increasingly talking about the prospect of a global pandemic resulting from a new strain of swine flu that had killed some people in Mexico City. Hey, maybe that was what I had: I was still coughing up stuff every now and again. Maybe I had picked it up in Indianapolis or something and had spread it all throughout the West and now was totally infecting the city of Portland. That would be unfortunate. I tried and failed to find a post office, since I needed a stamp and an envelope to mail the second of the two tickets for Leonard Cohen at Radio City Music Hall I had sold on eBay. I sat at Coffee Time with my laptop. Being back in the area, but especially in Portland, but especially in this neighborhood felt like stepping into a dream I had once had, one that was on the whole good but was, even more than that, dream-like. Then I drove back to Beaverton… got distracted at Fred Meyer, where I stopped to pick up some envelopes and stamps and ended up going grocery shopping again, picking up things I had forgotten to get earlier in the day. Back at the hotel I was encountering Internet problems again, so I watched television. Pandemic scares, pandemic scares. I posted on Livejournal, not in my newer (rarely-used) journal, but in my older account. 3 I had been seeing that Bluejay had not been responding to my IMs. I also felt unsure about V. —wouldn’t it be weird for me to get in touch with her? Those were the only people I knew I knew here. 4 It felt too early to be getting up, but I managed. Just after my pot of coffee had finished brewing, Salma called. (She hadn’t considered the difference in time zones, I assumed. ) I apologized, but I had to cut the conversation short. I had to shower and shampoo and shave and tuck in my shirt and drive to Tualatin for a job interview at ACS. It was lightly raining. I showed up at the place, but was told that I should have been told to bring a physical copy of my resume and that because I didn’t have it I should come back in two days at the same hour. Annoyed, I went back to the hotel room. I found that I was feeling sort of blecch: my stomach was making noises and I seemed to be having mild diarrhea. This didn’t last for long, fortunately, but I still kept inside for the rest of the day. 5 Wednesday was a stay-in-to-apply-for-jobs day. As expected, I began to feel that the world was a terrible place and that I was hopeless and that nothing would ever work out and that oh, woe is me, I just wanted to be safe and yet be myself and yet not be alone. I had known that I would have these times. It was all like, I’m not worth knowing, feeling insecurity in my worth as a friend, as an acquaintance, or as a colleague (although, oddly enough, I had never specifically felt unworthy to be a lover, perhaps because I had never quite been able to grasp what being a lover could mean that would be different from being a loving, cuddling, sex-partner-y close friend). I had two interviews lined up for the next day, one being the rescheduled interview at ACS and another being with the temporary agency Express Employment Professionals, which in Pennsylvania once upon a time had kindly provided me with a week of envelope-stuffing work. 6 I scored 100 words per minute on the typing test. ACS hired me. The day was beautiful, warm and clear. At that fancypants shopping center place in Tigard I ate out as I waited around for the time my other interview, the one at the temp agency, was supposed to happen. I couldn’t find that place, though, and I didn’t have a contact phone number for them, so I just no-showed. Back at the hotel room, I sat back down at the computer and saw that Karen, an OKCupid person I had messaged with the night before, was online. I IMed her, initiating a conversation that lasted for the next nine and a half hours. The next morning I woke up and was like, huh. It was almost noon, later than I had been waking up. Huh. So I have a job lined up. The next steps were to figure out where I would live next and develop a more precise middle-to-long-term strategy for improving my lot. And to continue to meet people. I grabbed some things to wear from one of the trash bags full of clean clothes that I was keeping in the closet, and I brought those into the bathroom, and I did thirty sit-ups on the bed, and I brushed my teeth and showered. I walked around the area of my hotel. After night fell I drove into Portland to somewhere along SE Hawthorne, where I had seen online that an ’80s goth night, Decadent ‘80s, was going on. There was no cover to get into the venue, and in addition to the room where this night was going on there was another, larger room, in which live bands were playing a show. The first band that played was a metal act, while the second was more indie and included a trumpeter and upright bass player. Goth club dancing was easy to jump right back into, and the fluorescent artwork on the walls of this particular venue was cool. Yes, I thought to myself, Portland is real. I didn’t get to sleep until late, although I needed to wake up early to check out an apartment. I pulled out from the hotel and parked in the shopping center nearby that had a Starbucks, and there was a long line in there that got even longer—to the door—in the time between my arriving and my getting coffee. (And the man behind me in line was all, “Why don’t you have two people working the register?” to a smiling barista who walked by him. To whomever he was with, then, I heard him say, “This is my Starbucks. ”) The apartment building I went to look at was huge and full of tiny efficiencies. It had been renovated in recent years, but I wasn’t convinced I couldn’t do better. “Welcome home,” Karen had said, the night before last, during our long conversation. It had felt nice to hear that from someone living here. 7 Out of nowhere I started hearing a rushing sound inside my ear. I thought at first that an insect had flown into it or something, but the sound didn’t go away. I drove back to the apartment and tried researching my symptom on the Internet. It was occurring mostly when I moved my jaw. Let’s see… I’ve been sick for a while now… when I went to the dentist last year I was told that I was in danger of developing TMJ problems… and last night my ears were ringing from the live music… Karen suggested an inexpensive clinic. I thanked her and went there. The doctor pushed on my ear and when I said it hurt he said that it was an infection. He prescribed ear drops for that, and antibiotics for the upper respiratory infection or whatever it was. There was downpouring rain as I exited the Fred Meyer with my prescriptions. Then I had another lengthy chat with Karen. We made plans to meet on Thursday. At a late hour the unreliable wireless stopped working for the thousandth time and would not reconnect. I woke up in the morning. It was Sunday, May 3, 2009. I called the front desk. They said that oh, sure, the Internet was working, but I needed to call the technical support number so that they could configure something for my room in particular. I called that number, tried spelling out “Beaverton” a couple of times to the person who answered, was walked through a few steps and then was put on hold. A half hour into the call I was finally told that there was nothing I could do, that they needed to ask the front desk to do something on their end and that I should just try connecting again later in the day. Oh, well. I tidied up a bit, then, before dialing up the front desk again. Then I finished tidying up and found that the Internet was finally back on. I set up another apartment viewing, this one for the following day. 8 It was not the best apartment imaginable, but it would only cost $425 dollars per month, and it was convenient to the highway and seemingly sort of private, inside a building that contained several of these small “bachelor” apartments but also larger units and artists’ studio spaces. 9 Tuesday night had me venturing deeper into Beaverton—or maybe into Hillsboro, I forget—to track down a karaoke night. But I arrived at the place and it was not just a sports bar in name but truly one in clientele, as well. Also, I didn’t see any karaoke; I just saw people playing pool and making use of a number of arcade machines, shooting games. It was like a fraternity hangout meets Chuck “E” Cheese. Kinda weird. So I left, but I still felt like going out somewhere and grabbing a drink, so I drove into Portland, and drove, and drove, and got some more of a feel for the distances between different areas. I didn’t stop anywhere, though. I went back online and repeatedly revised my OKCupid profile. I fell asleep feeling slightly depressed, but in the morning I was cheerier. I woke up around 9 or so to a call from the guy at the Falcon Art Community, where I had looked at the apartment the other day. I called him back after I had my wits together, in order to set up a time later in the day when I could drop off my application. And walking to Starbucks, running errands. To the Falcon again, where I asked more questions about the place and got a tour of the awesome downstairs with its arts and music studios (where Johnny Marr kept a studio during the recording of the Modest Mouse album he played on). But here would be the test: would what went down with the apartment in Kent (with the security deposit being lost and with me in fact needing to pay above and beyond the amount of that deposit because of the condition Zella had left the unit in) be an impediment to my being approved for a lease? 10 Oops. The Beaverton Transit Center did not have a parking lot, so I decided to take my chances parking in the lot near the Red Robin and Starbucks. On the light rail, then, I listened to Elbow on my iPod. Then there was an old and/or disabled person who needed the priority seating, so I moved to a seat in between a couple of other people and I looked either down at the floor or across the aisle and out the window. This was how it was on public transit. I texted Karen to ask where she was. “Under the umbrella,” was her reply, meaning that she was under the statue of the guy holding an umbrella. And there she was when I (belatedly) arrived, sitting under the shade of the statue-umbrella. She didn’t look at me directly as I approached, only pulled me down to sit next to her while she watched the square: “I’m trying to figure out what’s going on. ” We couldn’t figure out what the congregation of people was—some sort of small event, but we weren’t sure what, and we never solved the mystery. What day was this? Oh, yes. It was Thursday. But the Weather Machine forecast the weather in Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square each day, along with a triumphal something or other. Under the umbrella with Karen, we were just sitting. The conversation stopped and started. I walked with her past the Starbucks (“Screw that,” she said, although I was just looking for anywhere to get a small bite to eat where I could also use the restroom) to some other coffee shop. From there we walked to Waterfront Park. The sky gave conflicting signals, and sometimes it rained for a little bit, but mostly it wasn’t raining. We walked eastward along Hawthorne, in the direction of her neighborhood. The city overshadowed us both at all times; she loved it, I loved it. We went into a store full of toys for a dollar, and the guy behind the counter, when he saw us walk in, asked, “Have you been in here before?” and when we said that we had not he gave us squishy balls to throw at the glass door, and upon hitting the glass the balls went squish and stuck for a moment before recovering their original shape and falling to the floor. He also had us try on funny eye-magnifying glasses. Then we ate veggie burgers at some place. Then we went to Laurelhurst park, where she decided that we should sit down on a bench by the pond. On the bench I stretched my arms out, leaning back. I thought for a moment about how this motion was like the classic “date” move turned television and movie cliché, in which a guy yawns and stretches and then tries casually to put his arm around the shoulders of his date. Of course, I didn’t do that, but Karen did take the opportunity to tickle my belly a bit with her fingers. And we were sitting rather closely to each other, there on the bench. And I asked her questions. I got more stories about her past than she had gotten from me about mine. The company that was doing the background screening for my rental application had called me earlier and left a voice mail (which I had listened to in the men’s room of the restaurant). They wanted the contact information for Arden’s landlord. They called again while Karen and I were at the park, and I decided to step away and take the call. I told the guy that I would get back to him the next day with a contact number. We walked some more along the paths of the park. Deciding, then, that beer would be a good idea, we set back out. Karen’s favorite bar was downtown; we were going to walk back the whole distance we had already walked in order to get there. She pointed out different places along the way. We crossed the Burnside Bridge and ended up at the Tug Boat, her preferred bar. It was Trivia Night, as it turned out, and she had forgotten this fact. Trivia Night wouldn’t really allow for much conversation between us, so we walked a bit farther to, oh, I forget where, but they were a bar and I was also able to order potato skins with broccoli there. We sat in a booth, except for when we smoking cigarettes, at which times we sat outside at one of the tables. During one of these smoke breaks I extended my arms for a hug and she said, “Oh, yay. I’ve been wanting to do this all day. ” And we hugged for a long time, indeed, before going back inside. At some point we went back to the Tug Boat. I was going to have to drive back from where I had parked near the transit station, so I only ordered a water at this point. Outside of the Tug Boat she initiated a kiss. We kissed for a long time. And when I caught the MAX that was headed back towards Beaverton, it was with a quick goodbye peck on the lips. I made it back to my hotel room, and when I kicked off my shoes I finally let myself silently admit to myself that the day had gone well. "

    "body": "11 My computer suddenly froze up; the screen faded into a mash-up of what I had been doing previously and a series of color lines. When I then turned it off and back on it either refused to load the BIOS or it booted and then froze again. I managed, at least, through several hours of trying, to get into Windows for long enough to email myself text backups and to burn CDs of those MP3s I hadn’t already backed up. What else was I to do, then? I headed out to search for an inexpensive netbook. I tried Best Buy, first. I took note of what they had there, but I wanted to try searching elsewhere as well. In the parking lot, I saw that my right front tire was again dangerously low on air. I walked across the street to an auto parts store and asked the guy behind the counter for his suggestion of where I might go to get a tire repaired. The Firestone just up the road, he told me. The guy at Firestone was helpful. He took a look at the tire and said that he thought it could be repaired, but that because Firestone had a lot of strict rules about what they could and could not fix, he himself would not be able to do it. Try across the street, he told me. This being a busy suburban artery, it took me about fifteen minutes of waiting at stoplights, turning, turning again, merging, waiting at stoplights, forgetting whether I had driven too far, etc. , before I managed to get into the parking lot across the street. The guy there said at first that he was ready to fix it for fifteen dollars… but then he said that no, see, the air was being lost from this part here, and it wasn’t just like a hole that he could patch up, and I would need to get a new tire somewhere. But the guy at Firestone had filled the tire up with air again, so I wasn’t too worried about it going flat on me immediately. I still needed a computer, so I called information to find the address of a nearby Wal-Mart (a couple of times, after being rushed by 411 operators who didn’t want to waste their time on helping me find which was closest. ) What I really hoped for in a netbook was another Linux-based system. I got to the Wal-Mart and they had no such thing, though, so I just went back to the Best Buy that I had went to in the first place, and there I bought an HP Mini that ran on Windows XP. I was then indoors, hiding inside my hotel room, until the next evening when, chatting with Karen, I asserted that I needed to get out and do something. I asked her if she would care to join me, and she agreed to meet me at the same place, Pioneer Courthouse Square. I arrived much later than either of us had been expecting. “I thought that I was ready to just walk out and go, but then I looked at myself in the mirror,” I explained to her when I arrived. I also had had some difficulty finding the Sunset Transit Center (which actually had a Park and Ride) and had found myself on the wrong highways, and so on and so on. (I also had stopped along the way for coffee and—strangely, for me—lip balm. ) Finally in Portland with Karen, though, all was well. She had been to the Tug Boat while waiting for me, but something was going on there, Salsa Night or something, and that was undesirable, and she had already had a couple of drinks, and she led me to that long stretch of park by PSU, and she pulled me by the arm when she was concerned that I might be about to walk into some other pedestrian or something. Then we were sitting on a bench and people were passing by, and she was telling me how she had been thinking that sitting here, she would be pretending that we were students, but how now that she was looking around at the students they all seemed so young! They were just babies! (She was thirty-two. ) And I thought to myself about how, when I started hanging out with Arden, I had begun to have thoughts like, “Now that I’m finding out what it’s like to be hanging out with thirty-somethings, I don’t know if I’ll want to go back to my fellow twenty-somethings again. ” But my twenty-eighth birthday had felt like sort of a shock to me, like, “Oh! Really?” But now here I was having thoughts like, Now I’m dating like a city-dweller, which, how can I explain? Except to say that it was dark out and I had been led here because it could be a semi-private spot, you know, with a bench to sit on but I guess without constant panhandlers, but the pedestrian traffic was still moderate, like in the movies. Dating like a city-dweller, dating in the same way people with careers dated, dating as if you got to be picky and could decide what you wanted because there were plenty of other dates you could be having. Dating for the purpose of perhaps finding a mate? These were obnoxious tropes of young urban professional normalcy, but as far as I could tell, this was what we had, in the 21st century in the United States: what we saw in the movies was what we had to go by. The culture was as a matter of course always changing in ways that nobody could keep track of, and we all felt strangely excited, whenever we changed our lives, to be going to our first frat party or to be making ourselves into that striking kinda scary person with the multiple facial piercings, or to be some kid’s goofy uncle. Tourism was one thing—seeing new places and posting our photographs to Flickr and all that—but what was much more exciting, and what could really stay with us, and what could really influence who we thought we were, was stepping into movie scenes and being our own variation of that person. And in real life we could be more than one type of person in any given second, but we were still playing roles, playing roles all the time to some degree, because we were emulating all the time, because that was just how people learned, and careers and marriages and whatever were all fleeting. Then, back to the bar we had gone to before. We mostly sat outside this time, though, at the tables in the front. Karen had said to me, last time, “Welcome to Portland,” in a way that had felt like a sort of relief. But even though she had been a transplant herself, she was not completely without the sort of possessiveness and anti-outsider mentality to which a quick Google search for “moving to Portland” would introduce a person. The conversation felt a bit more free, tonight, owing, I supposed, to this not being a “first date”. Then, look at the time!, she said to me, “Okay, you have a couple of options. You can get going now and catch the train back to Beaverton, or you could come home with me. And by that I don’t mean, ‘Let’s go back to my place and fuck. ’ But I mean that you’re welcome there. I have a futon you can sleep on or whatever. ” I laughed at the straightforward way she had put that, but also let her know that I found it endearing. I said that since she was offering, I would love to keep hanging out and see her place. “Yay,” she said. We waited, shivering, at a bus stop. We sat next to each other under the all-too-revealing late bus light—you know what that light is like, Reader, I’m sure. We were two young white people sitting among a couple dozen young white people, traveling down Hawthorne at one o’clock in the morning or whenever it was, on our way to the place where we were going to sleep. After watching some of her DVD set of Little Britain—Karen loved them Brits!—I was given another set of two options. I chose to sleep with her in bed, and then before long, she was again saying to me, “Okay. Decision time…” 12 It seemed that we were each a bit reeling from surprise, but also pleased when we awoke at some ridiculously late hour in bed and thought back on the previous night. (“I wasn’t expecting this to happen,” I had said. “Me neither,” she had replied, “I had thought to myself, ‘Should I shave?’ and then figured, ‘Nah. ’”) She walked me to a coffee place near the bus stop. Of course, my hair had been a mess since midway through the previous evening, and now that I had slept on it, I felt… well, you know what that feels like. The ride downtown, the walk to the MAX, the MAX to the car, the car to the hotel. Then the car back to Portland, for the Cloud Cult concert. It was at the Wonder Ballroom, a nice venue, and the show was great. The car back to the hotel. Chatting, still, with Karen. The original plan, prior to our impromptu sitting-on-a-bench-and-drinking-in-a-pub-night-turned-sleepover, had been for us to meet again the following day, Monday. It wasn’t like we were going to cancel our plans for that now… so, then, on Monday, the 11th of May, there we were at the Chrysanthemum Gardens across from Reed College. We sat in different places, admired flowers, and watched ducks and geese. She pointed out to me what she had noticed about the water in this garden, how there were no fish. Her theory was that the acidity of stuff that fell from the trees into the water maybe somehow was making the body uninhabitable to fish, “Because, even if there’s a pond that’s entirely man-made, at some point some eggs are going to get in there somehow, from being stuck on a duck’s foot or something. ” We walked from there to the Pub At The End Of The Universe, a nice place, where we met up with her friend Amy, her closest friend from the circle of “her lesbians”, who kept us entertained with stories. After Amy left, we walked to another bar. Sitting at a table in front of it, I talked to her about western Massachusetts and she talked to me about various places in the U. S. she had seen. She talked about the slugs here in Oregon, and how she had stepped on one once and it had made a disgusting, terrible sound and it had taken her forever to wash the guts off her foot. Then to Fred Meyer for macaroni and cheese, beer, and heartburn relief. And then back to her apartment, which she kept dark during the day with black drapes covering the windows. More cuddling up on the futon while watching Little Britain. More smoke breaks on the porch. “I need to get a job,” she said. Then she took me aside to point out out the moon between the trees. My ear problems were returning. In the morning, I told Karen that I was leaving—(“Wait, do you know where you’re going?” she asked. “Walk left, turn right, then catch the 14 downtown,” I said. “Okay, good,” she said. )—and then headed out. I text messaged Star, someone else from OKCupid, whom I had arranged to meet this afternoon. Would it be okay to push our date ahead by an hour, so that we could meet at 4 instead of 3? I explained that my ear infection had not cleared up and that I would need to go to see a doctor again. She said that that was fine. The doctor saw something that he had not seen in my ear the previous time—what looked to be a cyst. He wanted me to see a specialist, to have them look at it. He set me up with an appointment for the following morning. Then I drove to Portland and met Star. She was late because of traffic. We sat with hot beverages in Pioneer Square. We talked about unemployment and about how I’ve been hopping from city to city over the past few years. Then, suddenly, she said that she had to go, because she had plans for a movie and some other things, and she was sorry that she had been late and she had thought that we were going to meet at three and that we were going to have more time to talk. I went back to Beaverton and did the usual—some more passive browsing of apartment listings, some catching up on my journal-writing, and then chatting with Karen. It took me a long time to fall asleep… but I did manage to pull myself out of bed early in the morning when my alarm went off. I drove to a nearby 7-11 and purchased a money order for the amount of the balance that Kentbrook Apartments in Washington state wrongly claimed that I still owed; I then went to the post office and mailed this payment off. My plan had been to head directly to my doctor’s appointment after taking care of this, but, well… looking at the clock, it was obvious that I would not be able to make it in time. I called the place and had the appointment rescheduled for 2 PM. I then promptly fell back to sleep aaaaaaand… you guessed it! I failed to wake up for the appointment. And the late afternoon passed by, and the evening, and then it was night… And then it was the morning, again. Karen had told me to just head on over when I awoke, so I text messaged her at 10:34: “Good morning! I’m crawling out of bed and getting breakfast. ” Then, at 11:41: “I’m guessing that I’ll be there around 12:30. ” After I had parked near her house, I called. I reached her voice mail, hung up, then walked a bit to try to remember which house was hers… but she called, and then she was opening the door just as I was stepping up to it. She was hugging me, “Mmm,” just waking up. She made a cup of coffee for herself, and we were sitting there on the futon, and time passed, and I had to remind her that the night before, while she was drunk, she had signed us up for the “Brew Crew” event through the Meetin (not to be confused with Meetup) web site. “Do you still want to go there?” she asked, sounding a bit regretful about having signed up. I told her that I did, and so then she was like, okay. And oh, I don’t know. We walked around, killing time before the 5:30 rendezvous… And she said, “This looks closed,” in the parking lot of a Chinese food restaurant, and so we sat down there. I pulled out a cigarette and she said, “Oh! Good idea,” and I said that smoking a cigarette was what I felt like I should be doing, sitting on the pavement like this: it made me feel young again! Karen and I were sitting identically, each of us with one foot up and resting on the opposite thigh, and for a moment I felt that we were two peas in a pod. In general she dressed like me, in plain black slacks, black shoes, a plain black t-shirt, and maybe a sweatshirt or something for warmth. I was wearing a blue button-up shirt today, but whatever… Two peas in a pod, and yet my intuition about Karen was ambivalent. How one’s gut instinct about a person can be conflicted, I’m not sure, but about Karen, mine was. And maybe it wasn’t really my gut, either: maybe it was my mind. She had said to me in online chat something along the lines of, “This should be interesting. You value honesty and I’m a liar. ” She had talked to a friend of hers who had known her in her younger and angrier days. Discussing me, Karen had referred to me as patient, and her friend had responded, “Well, he would need to be patient, dating you. ” But that was the Karen of many years back her old friend was referring to; the Karen of 2009 had been tempered, had been mellowed out over time. Then we went to the pub and found the people from the Meetin. There were only three of them there, at first, and both Karen and I seemed to be younger than they were. I had a few minutes of, Aw, crap, thinking to myself that this had been a mistake. I was afraid of answering questions that I didn’t really want to answer—these being, of course, the very basic questions—but after I had presumably looked a bit nervous about discussing my super-recent move here the table’s conversation flowed on merrily to other topics, and as others arrived and as I drank from the tasty beer selections of a local brewery I found that I was enjoying myself. I chose from the food menu the baked mac and cheese, which, when it was served to me, was coveted by many of the others at the table. After our food had all been consumed, the waitstaff decided for us that we were going to move to a different spot, from the open space outside to a couple of tables in a covered and heated but still outside patio area. Karen and I needed to squeeze ourselves next to completely different people this time, but it was all good. The woman I was next to, Mitzi, asked Karen and I how we had met. “Online,” one of us replied. “Through what site?” Karen made a face, hoping to avoid answering the question, but Mitzi was persisting: “Don’t be embarrassed. Whatever it is, I have an account there, too, I’m sure. ” I just said it, then: “OKCupid. ” Mitzi said, “Oh, I’m on there, too…” and began talking about how she preferred to plan for any first date to be something short, something that would have a time limit, by saying that she would need to be somewhere else a little later in the night. “Why do you do that?” I asked, thinking, of course, about my astonishingly short date with Star earlier in the week. “To have an easy out if the date is terrible,” Mitzi replied, “And if it goes well, then it’s his job to get in touch and to plan the second date. ” She went on a bit about people taking dates too seriously, people who would sign up on the site, meet up with one person, then get into a relationship with that first person, only to finally admit to themselves, six months or a year down the line, that that person wasn’t really what they had been looking for. Was this pointed, seeing as how she knew that I had just moved here, had met Karen through a personal ad, and was now going with her to my first Meetin event? Probably, but I could shrug this off, and I was talking to people and I had a good buzz going, so, yay. The group was relocating, then, down to the street to a bar. Karen recognized the bartender as the woman who had started the roller derby team she had once been in. And once we had our drinks, Karen was leading us outside—I think, perhaps, that she was embarrassed to be seen as a part of this larger group, this group that had stumbled in, already loud and full of beer, from another establishment—and so she found a two-person table that was around the corner. We had talked before about finding cigarettes, and so I asked where the closest place was, and she said that it was down the road a bit, maybe some eight blocks or so? And I said, ah, never mind, but she said that she wanted to go, she would get us smokes. Once she was gone I shrugged, picked up our beers, and went inside to where everyone else was sitting. The loud conversation was continuing… but then, oh, I don’t even remember… did she lead us back outside? Maybe so. Or maybe I had stopped drinking. But back at Karen’s place, even after I had munched down half of a $1. 19 (or whatever) bag of Doritos, I was lying down on the futon while we continued to watch our way through Little Britain, and I was vastly preferring to keep my eyes closed so as not to be disappointed in how foggy and spinning the television appeared through my drunk-vision. At a certain point, I asked if she could turn off the set, and if I could just lie down there… I said that I would sleep here, that I was pretty sure I wasn’t going to be sick but that I was on the edge… and she took statement of mine quite seriously, to the extent that she lay down a bath towel over the rug by the futon, and set down a wastebasket, and left her water bottle there for me. But I was correct: I did not get sick, and I merely needed to let myself pass out there, and then I woke up at 3:30 or 4:00 or something like that and said that I was better, that I didn’t get sick, and would she mind if I joined her in bed. At something like 1:00 in the afternoon we finally both got up. We walked out for breakfast. I stopped at my car for an opportunity to use the hairbrush and pomade I had left in there… and meanwhile, I was talking to Kentbrook, who confirmed that they had received my money order… so I called the background investigations company, and blah blah blah… eggs and potatoes and toast with coffee… waking up… more Little Britain. Eventually I left and Karen was about to leave for fun at the Tug Boat. I went back to Beaverton and sort of just decompressed and looked for things that I might do by myself over the weekend before starting my new job. "

    "body": "13 A phone call woke me up on Saturday. Ivan from the Falcon again, calling with good news: I was cleared for the apartment. He suggested that I come by on Monday to hand over the security deposit. I said okay. Excited, then, I went online and looked up, oh, whatever came to mind about how living there would be. Bus lines or whatever. I kept meaning to get back to sleep, but it didn’t happen. I applied to a couple more jobs, then got sucked into watching movies on Showtime. I had planned to take part in a Meetup that was going on, a night at a comedy club, but eh. I was not feeling up to it, and it was for a “singles” group, whose members looked to be mostly older than I was. I fell asleep around, oh, we’ll say 9:00. I had a dream in which I decided that I really needed to see the band The Decemberists in concert, and for some reason this dream woke me up. Karen was still online, as she had been when I had gone to sleep. What time was it, again? Like 2:30 in the morning. I kept expecting to fall asleep, but nope. My ear did not seem to be improving… Oh, and something (unrelated) had happened earlier in the day: I had called up Bank of America, because I seemed to have accidentally thrown out the replacement card from one of my credit cards… but I wanted to do my first ever cash advance, just wanted to take several hundred dollars from the line of credit on a card that currently had a zero balance, to put that into my Bank of America checking account, to take care of the costs of moving into the new place and getting by while I waited for my first payday to arrive. What I got was $6,000 of my available credit taken away. This was what I got for being stupid enough to speak to a human being about the matter, and for telling them what I wanted to do, instead of maybe lying and trying to get them to give me the verification number from the back of my card over the phone, or something. But I had at least managed (after some pushing) to get the advance, since (and no one had asked how much I wanted to transfer!) I still had more than enough of an available line of credit to tap into for the money I wanted. In the morning I did not skip the other Meetup I had signed up for, the Poetry and Coffee one, which this week was doing song lyrics. I got to Portland plenty early, although my plan to print out the lyrics of songs I liked was foiled by a FedEx place that did not open until noon on Sundays. Waiting in line for coffee before introducing myself meant that I joined the table after discussion had started. I was sitting right next to the group organizer, although I did not get much recognition out of him. In all I didn’t have a great time, but I did like watching everyone. This, I supposed, would be the problem with me and any writing groups I might try to attend—I’m just really shy in that sort of setting. One of the group members asked if I had been to a meeting before… she said that I looked familiar. I said that nope, this was definitely my first Meetup. (I did not mention that I had messaged her on OKCupid, that she had responded, that I had responded to her response, and that she had not responded to my response to her response. ) Then I drove to Karen’s and woke her up again. She was cutely groggy. We walked to a place a few blocks away and had a couple of beers, and while there I asked her questions about her college years, and then the televisions in the bar were turned up for The Simpsons, and then we went back to her place and before long, it seemed, it was Monday morning and there was loud work being done on the house, people banging on things in the basement, or something… so we were up earlier than planned, and I took off. This was going to be my first day of work, but even before that I would be dropping off the security deposit for the new apartment. I parked my car, walked to Portland Community College to use their ATM, then walked to the front door of the Falcon and called up Ivan. I had remembered incorrectly the time when we were supposed to meet: he had said noon, I had thought it was eleven. I killed an hour sitting at PCC with coffee and my notebook. As I walked around the block, waiting to call Ivan again, I saw him opening the back gate behind the Falcon to park his vehicle. He said, Oh great, and directed me into the little fenced-in outside area, where people had little strips to garden in, and where there were a couple of picnic tables. He pulled out the paperwork and said that the room he had shown me was no longer available, but that there was another one… This different room seemed inferior, but oh well. Again no kitchen, although I thought I remembered the other room having a counter and a hot plate. The windows did not reveal the urban landscape as those in the other room had, but instead opened to a small stretch of roof that was not really the roof, but was where the big exhaust pipe or whatever from the downstairs rose past. I signed the papers anyway. V. had messaged me on Facebook, asking if I was back in Portland. I said that I was. She asked me whereabouts. I told her where. She didn’t respond further. This was similar to what had happened with Bluejay, who eventually had responded to a wink sent by me on OKCupid… just sort of a cool hello. Then I was at work! The first day of a three-week training session involving something like twenty-seven people. We learned about Apple, Inc. and read about Mac OS and yadda yadda. It was a bore, at times, but it also felt good to be back at work. Tuesday night, I went directly to Karen’s after finishing that day’s training. I brought over the Cloud Cult DVD, No One Said It Would Be Easy. Smoking with her on the porch, I said, “Thank god I made it here. ” “Explain, please,” she said. “I don’t mean here, tonight. I mean here, in my life. I feel like my life can finally begin, now. ” “Because you moved to Portland?” “Well, sort of, yeah. But it’s not just the location. It’s the fact that I managed to get myself here to Portland, to the place where I want to begin, so it’s not just living for the future, for the life that I might be able to start working on at some point in the future. It really just feels like a beginning. The beginning. It feels like the beginning of my life. ” Wednesday’s training was more of the same. Here it went; here was time beginning to fly again. As I had done the previous couple of days, I smoked little throughout the day… because being within close proximity to all these other people for eight hours was making me notice the frightening things my lungs were doing, and how I was needing to cough every once in awhile… and this was 2009, and the era of socially acceptable cigarette smoking appeared to be at its end… and I was twenty-eight years old, and I sort of felt like I was dying. Wednesday night, I did some cleaning, did some laundry, and so on. 14 On Thursday, May 21, I went over to Karen’s after work, as planned. I bummed cigarettes to her. (My last time visiting her, I had said, “I’m going to quit smoking. ” She had said, “Oh, thank God. ” She added that I sounded terrible… that when I coughed, as I often did, there was clearly something going on in there, and it wasn’t good. ) She gave me beer. We talked about the history of our love lives; I was embarrassed to tell mine. (As I was getting older, the danger of becoming homeless and without resources was only going to keep increasing, especially considering how my social skills worked and didn’t work. But wouldn’t things get better? Wouldn’t it, at this rate, not take very long before I could feel like I had a network of support here in Portland? Maybe. Couldn’t I survive? I probably would. I was, I thought, done with moving from place to place. And I guess, well… throwing my past under the bus was part of how I was trying to seal the deal with myself, was part of how I was trying to ensure that whatever I did, I was going to stay in this place, now. And on this night, Thursday, May 21, 2009, Karen talked to me about her parents, how they had thought that her moving out here was crazy, and how her father had just been waiting for that call when she would ask him for a loan so that she could move back east… and how, when she had been here for five years, she got a message from her mother saying how much she admired what she had done. Also on this same night, I asked Karen which people, whether friends or lovers, had really been ones who made a difference in her life, at least for a time, even if they had eventually grown apart. And she had a difficult time with this question. She said that her parents had influenced her greatly, of course… but then she was reluctant, having a difficult time naming people she had met in life, outside of her family, who had been important. ) In the morning I finally got around to calling to schedule a time when I could pay rent, sign the lease, and start moving in. I arranged for this to happen the next day. At ACS we finished the modules for that week’s training. We sidejacked for the first time: I listened to a couple of calls that were handled by a woman whom the trainer, Josh, told me to make smile. Sidejacking further suggested to me that this job was probably not going to be too bad or too difficult. At lunch my self-control totally failed and I went to Jack in the Box. I sat in my car, then, parked in a strip mall parking lot, and listened to a national news report about the state of the economy and the states with the highest levels of unemployment. (Oregon was in second place, with 11% unemployment. The only state faring more poorly was Michigan. ) 15 I did the paperwork on Saturday, signed the lease, got the keys. I moved in and set up about two-thirds of my stuff. Karen and I were supposed to be meeting, but it kept being that oh, it was going to be just a little bit longer before she left the Tug Boat—another beer brought over to her without her asking, that sort of thing. But hey, whatever. I drove to her neighborhood and killed time wandering the aisles of the Fred Meyer at 39th and Hawthorne, trying to think of what I would immediately need at the new apartment. But boy, was I spacey. I was in need of food. Karen led me back inside the Fred Meyer, saying, “I have a microwave. Get something you can microwave at my place. ” I stopped to consider one freezer case, but she said, “The healthier stuff is over here. ” Then I was stopping to look at the “healthier” frozen, microwavable meals. I picked out some cheese ravioli, and for measure also grabbed a bag of Veggie Booty. At her place we watched Wall-E. Neither of us had seen it before. The next day, we went to an event that I had seen on the Meetin web site, a pizza-and-karaoke birthday celebration for someone neither Karen nor I knew. (But the site had said that newcomers were welcome, so hey. ) And it was another good time, particularly after the pizza had been finished and we had moved on to the karaoke venue and people were singing. But Karen wasn’t enjoying herself. She was uncomfortable with the crowd. (“This is not the Portland I like,” she said. ) It was hard enough to get her to stick around until after I was called up for my second song: “They’re not going to get around to you again,” she tried telling me. I looked at my clock; it was like, what, ten thirty? “Yes, they will,” I said. And yes, I did get to sing again (I did Tiffany’s “I Think We’re Alone Now”, having already sung Morrissey’s “The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get”. ) I was enjoying myself… but then it was, per Karen, time to leave. And she was rushing down the street, pulling me by the hand… always making sure that I wasn’t wandering into traffic. (“Taking care of me because I’m five years old?” I asked. ) Back at her place, she said something like, “Okay, I think we learned that the next time you want to go to that sort of event, I just won’t tag along. ” The next day was Memorial Day. I checked out of the Beaverton hotel and moved the last of my stuff into the Falcon. For dinner I walked the couple of blocks to the McMenamin’s Chapel Pub, where I had a Boca Burger and tater tots and used my netbook with its wireless network. Then I drove back to Karen’s. It was a nice day, when I moved into my new place. 16 Time passed. More time passed. And then, and then. 17 Should circumstances worsen, such that I am unable to continue with this project… I just wrote that sentence now, but I’ve thinking of writing something along the lines of it for some time now. The thought goes beyond “what happens if I get hit by a bus tomorrow”. It’s more like, hey, I can’t take for granted that I will have, you know, a computer, and the ability to pay for vanity printings of my life story, for much longer. After all, it’s June 21, 2009. And you know who I am, where I am in my life, what I have and haven’t done with myself. It makes sense. Talking with Karen, in her apartment, and out front on the steps while smoking cigarettes. Late at night, although I know that I have to wake up before five in the morning for work. “We’ll adjust,” I said, talking about the United States. “Because that’s what people do,” said Karen. “We’ll adjust because we have to. ” And for nine to twelve hour shifts outside of the city, back to the same old (but worse-feeling because it’s current) immensely-stressful-to-me call center work grind, I’m trying to work as much overtime as I can handle. My ear is still feeling weird, sometimes, but weirdness isn’t pain. What is happening with that damn upper-right wisdom tooth of mine, however, is pain. And while I still have some credit with the banks, you know, I may as well do something nice for myself, right? And get that taken care of. Pretty much everyone is unemployed in this city, except me. The medical field is the next “hot job market”, and to become a student at the local community college involves camping out the night before. Talking about my need to up my income—because not only could I not be all right if I lost my job, I also couldn’t be all right even if I could stay in my job and somehow begin to enjoy it. Me to Karen, about Portland’s economy: “But Portland isn’t like anywhere else. The population here is really well-educated, plus they’re willing to work for a lot less than they could make elsewhere… because they love it here. And yet they’re the sort to strive for more than the average person: after all, they up and moved here. ” Should circumstances worsen, such that I am unable to continue with this project… Then my autobiographical voice will have sunk down into the same old mire. And I’m sad that I didn’t write a novel… Karen and I talking about race. “There’s a shooting here and people care,” she said. This sounded like simple affection for the city of Portland, but she turned it into, “I compare it to where I grew up and it’s like… I come from a place where there’s a huge Black population and lots of shootings. And then I come here, where it’s overwhelmingly white, and there are hardly any shootings…” (This is a scene, future Reader, that I can only imagine will be repeating itself in some form in your age. ) And Karen said of mankind, “Lots of us need to die. Do you know how many people this planet can sustain, compared to how many of us are here now? It’s funny how so many people who talk about being ‘green’ and doing things for the environment will never say, ‘You know what you can do for the planet? Don’t have kids. ’” Considering how much of my life had been motivated by the presumption that I was living in the latter days of a bizarre and astonishing era, perhaps the fall of the American Empire might feel like a natural environment for me to be in. And I had already lived a pretty full life, as far as I was concerned. And just in case, you know, just in case it was going to be like that, I decided to postpone sleep, one Sunday evening, to try to write what could serve as an intentional conclusion, should circumstances worsen, to my Life Story. Because that’s what things were feeling like. 18 And yet still more time passed—in a whir. 19 July 15, 2009. Arden responded positively to my suggestion that we talk on the phone sometime. So we talked. I was sitting outside of the Southeast Grind when I called. I drank coffee and smoked cigarettes there. 20 And the routine had become: an average of two and a half hours of sleep before ten-hour work shifts on Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays. Then ten hours of sleep—until noon or so—on the other days, matching Karen’s sleep schedule. Never sleeping in my apartment, always instead at Karen’s. Except, perhaps, for a fifteen minute nap sometimes, after work. And dozens of resumes going out, trying to find a better job. Karen said she thought she was making it harder for me to meet a budget. Man, I was drinking a lot of beer. But no, actually, we weren’t going out very often, although we were one after another taking each bottle out from its six pack, and sitting on the couch, and perhaps we were just talking, or she was showing me YouTube videos of bands or standup comedians (until it would get old and I would say, “Okay, shall we do something else now?”) or watching a TV, often Twin Peaks. 21 On July 16 I called out of work, because I was still awake when I would normally be waking up. My ability to function was not getting better; it was getting worse. 22 Charlie was on a road trip to Portland. He didn’t know I had moved here. 23 It had been such a shift to leave Arden and come out here. I had begun missing Arden terribly while in Beaverton, but that had been like, you know. Okay, so I had made my stupid choice. It’s too bad no one can stop me from making all these stupid choices. At least now I know better than to think I can snap my fingers and have an okay life. And Arden still felt that I had felt that she had held me back. I talked to her again on, July 21, 2009. I’ve lost my grip on everything because I can’t be helped and I feel so regretful and I can’t believe I ever said it wasn’t working out, although I loved her. Although I loved her and kept trying to leave, although I had nothing bad to say about her. 24 Seeing Charlie was good. I met him, the guy he drove out with, and other people at a karaoke bar, just for one night. 25 Karen asked if I was coming over. I considered sleeping in my own apartment, for a change… I was feeling, somehow, that I had begun to make progress in getting my brain back from wherever it had wandered to. Not that Karen had done anything to my brain. But I had been spending my time being stressed out from work, being dangerously sleep-deprived, and getting drunk every night. (The part about getting drunk every night had not seemed to hurt me, but as I reflected I began to think that it actually had, by preventing me from processing life as it happened. ) (And it was a habit that I did not want to be in. It sort of astonished me to see how easily I had been drawn into the routine. ) I was a little bit more candid, a little less entirely closed off to Karen on this particular night, after I finally decided to head over and visit her. I still wasn’t acting like I had been before, back when I had not exhausted myself and panicked at my financial calculations and started to think, in a complete about-face, that I should have gone to Massachusetts in the first place. This was not okay. This erratic brain activity was not okay. Reading the Life Story on my netbook in Karen’s living room after she went to sleep made this seem very obvious. (I had told Karen, before her going to sleep, that I felt ungrounded because of my lack of friendships. This was something that had affected me during my year with Arden, and it was something that was affecting me now in Portland. ) 26 She gets in bed. I’m so hot. I go to the living room and turn off the light. She goes in the bathroom and runs the shower. I open the door a crack. She smiles. “May I?” I ask. “No,” she says. Then she’s in the living room, on the couch with me. “Are you the only one here?” she asks. “Yes,” I say, confused. I wish she would open some windows; it’s night, and much cooler outside. But she won’t. She insists that it’s just as hot outside. 27 Heat wave. For a couple of days in a row Karen and I go to the movies and then walk around the mall. Finally it’s time for me to start packing. I start on Thursday, the 30th. Then I stay over at Karen’s again. In the morning, Karen cried. I left. That night, I stayed in a motel in Ontario, Oregon. 28 After an hour’s sleep in the hotel room, I couldn’t get back to sleep. I went to the vending machine and got a candy bar. Then my wisdom tooth started throbbing again. This was a big part of why I was going back: I was having regular, unpredictable pain in my wisdom tooth, chunks of which had been falling out for years now, and I would need to get them pulled, but it would take all of the money I had to get them pulled. I took an Ibuprofen and applied some Orajel. What the hell was I going to do with my life? "

    "body": "1 [A letter to Arden, not given to her. ] Dear Arden: It’s late in a room in the Motel 6 in Lincoln, Nebraska. Before I go to sleep, I know that I will have to wind down… and by wind down, I mean just do anything that isn’t driving, for a while. I could search for jobs in Massachusetts, or something like that. I am getting that anxious feeling that I get, the one that tells me I should be figuring shit out. But I’m trying to steer myself away from that mindset, these days. That’s the mindset that got me through college, but since then I’ve taken it more than a little too far, I think. I’ve spent too many hours, I know, trying to scheme my way into a reinvented self and life. I guess I had to learn the hard way that no matter what I do, I can’t escape who I am, where I’ve come from, and what I have and have not done in my life. So, yeah. I’m letting myself indulge, here in the motel room, by writing you a letter. I know we’ll only have so much time to talk in person when I visit you in Pennsylvania, and I don’t know how well I’ll be able to get across some of the things that I want to say to you. The big thing that I want to say is that I love you as I have never loved anyone else. I am being selfish in saying this to you, as I suspect that it will make you worry for me. It may make you uncomfortable, but the fact that I have not shaken the visceral longing to be your partner—not just a partner, but your partner, and not just in your life, but with you—is something that I am carrying with me as I head back to Massachusetts. Our relationship did not work, and we did not find a way to reconcile it. But I see now that what you were giving me through your way of loving me was family. And I see now, thinking of our relationship from a different perspective, how remarkable it is that with you, I wanted to have that type of relationship. I did want this, even as the months passed and things again and again came to feel precarious. I wanted to be with you, even as I made an ass of myself in front of your friends, and even as we had times when, to hear you speak, it seemed that you couldn’t hear me at all. You contributed to my confidence and my sense of self, in ways that I did not see at the time. I was frustrated that while living with you I was not keeping many of the same habits, hobbies, and outlets that I had enjoyed in the past… but this was not your fault. I was not alone in Portland. I was dating someone for about two months, up until I left. I slept in her bed most nights. It was far too soon for me, and I showed it. It was nice until it started to feel like the start of a new relationship. Then I felt the sort of hesitation that I’ve often felt at that point of getting close to someone. Plus it was gross, because, when she and I would cuddle up in bed to go to sleep, I would find myself smiling, but then I would realize that I was smiling, thinking of you. My point is, there was something about you that made me feel things I had never felt before. Right now I’m not over you, but I know that time passes and life goes on and all that. I am humbled by seeing what I’ve done, how I over-thought my personal problems, how I was so scared that a breakup between us would leave me lost that I talked myself into trying to restart my life on my own terms, far away. I know you’re not waiting for any apologies, and I know that you don’t want me to be hard on myself. But I also want you to know that your warmth, humor, intelligence, kindness, and independence are just some of the qualities that make me love you still in that general, malleable sense that I hope will keep us friends. And the part about me wishing I hadn’t given you up—well, it’s enough that you’ve heard me tell you that. That’s for me to get over. It feels good to have written this. And now, I will be going to sleep. It’s like, I don’t even know how late, now. Love, Levi. 2 Julian and Heidi’s new place in Indianapolis proper. While Julian worked and Heidi was out studying, I walked to the Circle Center Mall, or whatever it’s called. It was a stormy day; I saw a restaurant closed due to flooding, streetlights were out, and the electricity was flickering inside the mall. 3 North Wales, Pennsylvania. Arden’s place. General kindness on her part gave way to my talking about our breakup and what I’ve been feeling since. Then we pretended that we were still together until I left. 4 I returned to Massachusetts on a Friday. Met Salma, had some drinks at the Sierra Grill and then at the Dirty Truth. Outside of Local Burger, which is open until 3 AM On Fridays and Saturdays, Tina interjected, and I asked if I knew her. And she was like, I’m Tina. And I was like, did that just happen, me seeing Tina and drawing a blank on who she was? 5 My cousin Amy’s wedding, at a golf course in Agawam. It was a nice day, and the area where the reception was held was nice. It felt good to be dressed up (in a tie and all) and so when I picked up Alix afterwards and drove with her to Haymarket I was still wearing the same thing. Salma was out with her current roommate, Jill J. They came to find us on the steps of city hall. We got some munchie-food at Local Burger before going to Bishop’s Lounge, where a band was playing. Amelia (with whom, you’ll remember, I once went to Montreal) was there. She weakly accepted a hug but then didn’t say anything and walked away. The next day Alix and I went to a potluck at where Salma’s living now in Holyoke. but I was kind of just sitting and talking about the weather with Alix for most of the time… and I was eager to unload my car and such… so I dropped her off, then headed back to Chicopee. But as I drove past I saw that my mother’s driveway was super-full, and I remembered that family were supposed to be hanging out there today. I said to myself, Eh, this is not what I was in the mood for. So I don’t try to park. I just keep driving. I have to relieve my bowels, so I go to the Barnes and Noble in Holyoke and do that. I overhear someone on her phone going, “What’s the name? Inherent Vice?” trying to locate the new Thomas Pynchon book, so I help by grabbing a copy and holding it out for her, then walking away. Haymarket is pretty much full, so I sit outside. Robyn comes by. I haven’t seen her for years. She’ll only be in this part of the state for another few weeks before she’s off to the Boston area to do a Master’s degree. 6 I hang out with Alix at her mom’s place and meet her new boyfriend, Flip. 7 I meet up with Salma, and when she starts asking questions about where I am in my life I have to answer honestly, and then I feel lost in the darkness. 8 When I start having ideas about my life again, the ideas involve Arden. They involve trying to be with her again. 9 I meet Alice at a specified time at Haymarket. At 7-11 she tells me to pick out something that I would like to eat at her place—she’ll pay for it with her food stamps. On her couch, she says that it’s good to hear me describe how much she was responsible for when P. was a newborn. She says that sometimes it’s hard for her to be sure about things, sure about whether they in fact happened in the way she remembers them happening. She reiterates that what brought her back to Massachusetts was that in Pennsylvania she had not been able to get the medications she needed: “Without my prescriptions, I’m useless. ” It becomes a quiet walk down the street with her. She narrates the hard time she is having trying to turn her thoughts into words. 10 I texted Arden, to see if she wanted to talk before she went to bed, and she said okay. And we talked about what bands she was going to see live soon, that sort of thing. 11 Salma had a going away party at her place. That was okay, once I had rolled out of bed and stopped being grumpy. I picked up Alix in Northampton but forgot to ask about the guitar I had left at her mom’s place. Salma’s room was where we spent most of our time, since it was where smoking was allowed. The next day Salma was texting me again, asking whether she would see me again before she left Massachusetts. It was night when I went back to her place; she was supposed to be packing, but it took a while for her to begin tossing clothes into the suitcase she would be bringing with her to Istanbul. My sleep schedule was getting later and later. That morning I finally began going through all the job listings I had bookmarked on my computer, filling out applications. Schools were doing their hiring for the upcoming school year. I saw that the school I had briefly substitute taught at in ‘06, Frontier Regional, was going to be holding its orientation on Thursday. Meanwhile I applied for a clerical position at West Springfield High School. I also applied to some medical administrative stuff. The next night, Karen texted to reiterate that she loved me, and said that she had been on a date with a nice guy, but he wasn’t what she wanted… he wasn’t me. The night went on, and soon it was morning, and it was a gray morning, and I went to Rao’s and now I’m at Rao’s, but I’m about to leave. I think my parking meter has expired. 12 Yes, the meter has expired. As I’m approaching my car, I see the parking guy standing there in front of my car. “Am I too late?” I ask. “Once I’ve printed it, I can’t take it back,” he says. 13 The morning has segued into afternoon. I go back to my mom’s place. At least it’s comfortable. And honestly, I have a reasonable degree of privacy here now. I’ve been awake since the night before. My mom and Bruce get back from their latest campground weekend… then I’m chit-chatting with them. My aunt Kim stops in at some point and we’re talking about how I’m thinking of giving substitute teaching a try again. (She works at a school in Holyoke, doing administrative things. ) 14 I sleep again. What’s the date, now? Aug. 17, 2009, which soon becomes Aug. 18. I apply online for a Massachusetts preliminary teacher’s license. Certification often increases the rate of pay for a substitute teacher. Also, I’ve applied to one listing that’s looking for an in-school tutor… the pay for someone certified is higher for tutors, too. The application for certification is costing $125 of my imaginary money. After the sun rises I begin to ask myself whether this isn’t rash of me. Why did I stop substitute teaching, before, back in ‘07? Oh, yeah… I called out one day, and then they stopped calling me, except for on, like, Halloween, I want to say it was… and then they tried me again one day after a while, but when they asked I said no, and that was that. 15 I’m waiting to hear a clear message from Arden that us being together again is not going to happen. This would help me because as things stand my brain keeps telling me that what I’m doing now is saving money, minimizing the month-to-month pressure on myself, getting myself prepared to move forward into that same life that I thought I was working for when I was still living with her. It’s disturbing to me to be like this. (People smoking outside, here at Denny’s, talking about welfare, ‘Oh, all these Puerto Ricans, some of them work hard, of course, but so many just live off of the system, and I don’t want want my money to support that,’ and people sit at the counter, or they walk over to one of the booths and then kneel on the seat and knock on the glass of the window in order to get the attention of someone who is standing outside. ) And if I substitute teach, then that leaves me time to write. Not much money, of course. There will probably be numerous days when I don’t have any work to do… but I’m not paying rent, so that won’t be such a big deal, right? 16 I pull in to the Jiffy Lube to get an oil change. A woman waves me in—turn the wheel left, turn it right, pull up straight—then asks, after she’s opened the door for me: “Where in Oregon?” “Portland,” I say. That’s where she’s from. She’s just excited to see an Oregon plate. She has been in Massachusetts for a few months. She misses Portland, too. 17 I drive down to Pennsylvania on Friday night. Friday night is great. Great continues through most of Saturday. On Saturday night, as we’re in bed after watching the first season and then some of the This American Life TV show, I begin to fall asleep. This makes Arden unhappy. It isn’t long before she leaves the room to cry. On Sunday morning, she is in ‘being distant’ mode. After things get a little more comfortable I ask about the night before. And it starts to sound to me like she’s pretty sure we aren’t going to be together. That shouldn’t be surprising, I know. Sunday night is a bit less tense, at least. I drive back to Massachusetts on Monday morning. She texts. She says a lot of things. I’m depressed. I’m not sure what to offer in response. She is saying that she never said there wasn’t going to be a chance for us to be together. This is true, but it was jarring, and surprising to me, to be reminded of how unhappy I could make her, and how quickly. She was seeing this, too. I find that in the wake of my weekend trip down there I am no longer dwelling on fantasies of getting my life together and moving to Maine after she moves there… …but I have no other fantasies to turn into goals, either. On Tuesday, Tina updates on Facebook about how she’s going to a free show at the Elevens, and the best idea I can come up with for the night is to go there, too. The band is called Tasha Yar. What they do is entertaining. Terry, an older guy who has been everywhere all the time in Northampton for years, is there, and he talks to me for a bit. Tina and I chat, also, when she goes up to the bar to get a drink, midway through the show. Once the band finishes playing I walk around town for a bit. I decide to go to Haven, feeling that I’m in the sort of mood that won’t let me get too down even if I have a distinctly bad time there… but even right off the bat, I’m able to enjoy it for what it is—just a club—and the fact that there is such a large proportion of people there who are strangers to me kind of lets me relax, and I dance more than I probably have danced there in many years. (It has been almost ten years since the first time I went to this club. ) And nothing really triggers my despair, my shame, my shock, the feeling that I have woken from a dream, a dream in which my peers were not poor and in which I could tell myself that my fear of not being able to sustain a middle-class lifestyle was only something in my head, something stemming from a brain chemical-induced anxiety or from an increasingly distant past in which I was a high school dropout who could not hold down a job and who mixed only with fickle, unreliable, irresponsible crowds. At the club I have conversations with people and then other people talk to them and I know those people too, so when the people I’ve been talking to wander away, the people who came up to talk to them are talking to me, and then someone else comes up and I try to remember whether I remember them, and then someone comes up and talks to them, and since their conversation seems to be getting involved I wander away, and then I sit down next to someone I am mistaking for someone else, and then it’s odd for a minute, and then I’m surrounded by people and I try to find an isolated corner, and I look up at the moon, and after midnight it feels almost chilly for the first time I’ve felt since the start of summer. On Wednesday morning it’s orientation for substitute teaching in Amherst. I’m the first to finish the paperwork. When I’m done they tell me that I’m free to go and that they’ll contact me when my CORI check comes back. I shouldn’t have stayed out so late the night before… I was in the good habit of waking up early and exercising and falling asleep at a reasonable hour. When I get back home from the orientation, I nap for what is probably a couple of hours. "

    "body": "135 One snowstorm after another. Images, a Hollywood montage. I’m outside at the group home in the little house, using a hand-held can opener as an ice pick because the door won’t open, the already once-frozen precipitation has refrozen in such a way. Driving my vehicle, my 1999 Saturn with the mysteriously fractured front and rear bumpers, slowly, up and down large hills and small mountains. Everything around me always the color of fog, but there is no fog. Weighing myself and nodding, satisfied. Cradling a guitar and beginning to write words on paper, then looking at the time. I get a phone call—my first acceptance to a Master’s in Occupational Therapy program. Bay Path College, a school in this area. I look outside. Feet of snow are on the ground. I drive some more through the grayness, shiver under layers of clothing when I step outside. 136 I never felt like a member of society, perhaps because I just wasn’t supposed to have happened. A bright and well-behaved child is supposed to get an education in school. A college graduate is supposed to be able to start on a career path. Should I or should I not be afraid of student loan debt? Of how long our society will still have the resources to make use of occupational therapists? Should I be eager to stay local, keep my job, and have lots more extra money in the bank? Or should I figure that my time will be worth more in the future, so I may as well live for myself, be creative and social while I’m still on the young side? Everything is unprecedented on the macro. 137 Past couple days: I began recording my first song using my new gear and software. Pretty sweet. Then I went to Hudson, New York with Salma to see Rasputina. Also pretty sweet. 138 I have a rejection from Pacific University somewhere in my mess of a living space. So, I guess where I’m going next won’t be Portland. 139 I finally talked to Esther the other night about how she’s basically in the eyes of her religion doing something immoral with me on a regular basis. She didn’t have much to say in response except that yup, she’s sinning. 140 Working tonight, there’s a lot of me and Lois listening to Penha talk about countries in Africa. Her perspective on America. The harrowing tales about refugees she has met in the immigrant community. The corruption in that part of the world. There is so much evidence of how terrifying it can be to be human. Lois mentions another of our co-workers, a woman from Iran, and how—I have heard this story before—she and her children, B’hai in Iran when the Shah came back into power, managed to make it here to America, but without her husband, who had to stay in Iran and was murdered there. Penha’s complaint about America, and her fear for it, has to do with the abuse of our welfare system. People have to work, is what she always says. Of course, when I hear this, my thought is always, What work do we have to do? For a long time now, ours has been a false economy, one that has mostly just kept us busy while machines and cheap labor from other countries and resources from other countries kept us going. The truth of how America got to where it is today is so complex, though, that it is hard to have a conversation on the topic… with anyone. Generation follows generation when sitting around the house and collecting government checks is Just What One Does: this can happen. These can be the survival skills that are passed on. But there is another, larger social trend I fear much more than that one. We have an elaborate infrastructure that should allow us to empower any American to be an informed and motivated member of society, but in practice we have let our universal primary and secondary education become hardly more than a sort of publicly-funded babysitting service. My generation, having few adequately-paying jobs to compete for, has been pushed to pursue more and more expensive education, keeping us out of the workplace for longer and longer and burdening us with debt. This has been happening for some time now, but it took what started happening to the economy in 2008 for the public at large to notice. Against this backdrop, I can’t help but feel skeptical even about doing what in theory should be a wise thing—training for a currently in-demand career that I am suited for and that requires a high level of educational attainment. I think of the old trick that people like to do to convince themselves that they deserve their good luck when the person next to them is not so lucky: “I made the right choices. That person should have known better than to blah blah blah. They should have done blah blah blah instead. ” Does it have no limits, this mental coping mechanism of ours? Can’t you always find some way to say in retrospect that someone should have made better decisions? 141 A trip with Alix to New York to see Bright Eyes at Radio City Music Hall! That was fun. Relaxing, to be in the city. 142 Accepted at Thomas Jefferson University/Jefferson School of Health Professions, in Philadelphia. I’ll probably go there. It’s beginning to set in how great the possibilities would be for me right now if I were graduating from an OT program at this moment. 143 Tomorrow is the “Discover OT Day” at Jefferson. I’m feeling pretty sure that this is the school I’ll be going to… but I want to poke around the city a bit, go to their event, and try to make sure that I have a realistic idea of what going there might be like. It has been a couple of years since I lived in Pennsylvania. First things first: I check in at my hotel, which is everything I hoped, given its prime location in Old City and its low, low price. ($55 per night?) The room is tiny, lacks cable television, and the window does not seem to close all the way. For me, it’s perfect. I drop my things off. Walking around, I have already found the weather to be remarkable. It is the first day since the start of winter that has allowed me to walk around in less than a winter coat without shivering at all, and, thanks in part to my being a little farther south geographically, I find that I am even a bit warm. But oh, that’s right: the heat. I had almost forgotten. I’m more sensitive to hot, humid weather than I am to cold, and the summers down here sort of made me miserable all the time. On the other hand, though, the winters here, while cold, never forced me into hibernation the way New England winters can. I really am gonna end up back here in Philly, huh? Who’d have thought? Today is St. Patrick’s Day. Bars throughout the neighborhood are filled with people wearing green. Irish bands play enthusiastic songs. 144 My body isn’t sure that it should let me sleep through the night—after all, I only really napped last night—but after it has woken me up, I manage to tell it that no, it’s okay, in fact I would rather appreciate if it could pass out for a little while longer. The “Discover OT Day” at Jeff begins at 8:30. It’s on the whole a young crowd—a lot of twenty-year-old college sophomores and such, since this is not solely for admitted students—but it’s a really nice event that they’ve planned out. I feel like this is a serious program and that it would give me a better education than my other possible options. So, like, yeah. I’m gonna do this. 145 I drive back to Massachusetts and head straight to Stephanie’s place for her birthday. I sit around and sort of help while she cleans, then Salma comes over. Salma and I help Stephanie decide what to wear, then we carpool to Northampton. At Alix’s we crack open the wine and yadda yadda. We stop briefly at the Basement before going to Amy’s Place in Easthampton. Stephanie and Brandon might kind of be beginning to date. We’ll see. Meanwhile, I was having a bit of a crisis over my appearance. Cutting my hair short always does that, really. Also, I think my face has changed for the worse after having my wisdom teeth removed. It sounds stupid, but I still see it. 146 Amy’s Place, Easthampton, Massachusetts. Stephanie having a sort of second part to her birthday festivities. Younger folks: it’s just Steph and me and some of her classmates from Italian classes at UMass. There’s the married couple from Connecticut—the woman, Hilary, who talks happily and at length to strangers and her more reserved, long-haired husband. Then two students who are themselves from Italy. One of them is named Sara. The other’s name I forget at the moment. Harry is texting, going, like, Goddammit, come to the welcoming and familiar arms of the Deuce for Friday night karaoke! But Stephanie has to get up early in the morning, and she will be going after this to take care of and watch a movie with Brandon. Sara, one of the Italian gals, wants to come to the Deuce if I agree to give her a ride back where she’s going afterward… but oops! She’s only twenty years old, so she couldn’t go to the Deuce, anyway. So, it’ll just be me and Harry there. 147 But Saturday is the day I really have plans for. Salma reacted with awe and delight when I introduced her to the music of Kaki King, and she has since then been eagerly awaiting today, this second day of April, 2011, when the two of us get to see her in Northampton. We arrive at the Iron Horse before the doors open. We get a decent table, order margaritas and food, and chat. The opening act, Joe Robinson, is good. Right after that set ends and before Kaki King’s set begins, Salma gets a call that she needs to step outside and take. For reasons I do not completely understand, she has agreed to be on backup tonight to receive crisis calls. It turns out that she needs take such a call at this inconvenient time, and this causes her to miss half of the set. 148 In Salma’s car we sit, trying to reach out and contact with our phones someone who will be in the mood to join us out tonight. It is for once Salma who is really ready to go, full of energy, wanting to keep going, wanting to hang out somewhere else and have another drink. What we end up finding is that Harry would like to go to Ibiza Tapas, which just opened up several months back, which I haven’t personally checked out yet. Then, he thinks, it would be fun to go to the Basement and dance to the silly 1950s and 1960s tunes that pack the dance space there on Saturday nights. Salma and I go to the tapas place and before I realize what is happening, there is Tina giving us hugs. “You know what I was thinking just recently,” Tina says to me, “Was that it’s about to be the ten year anniversary of my coming to the valley. That’s crazy, right?” And it is crazy. But at the same time… I know by now. I know that it has been ten years since those days. Ten years since 2001. Ten years since all that excitement of a time in life when I so very much knew and yet did not know what it meant to be part of a community and network of other human beings. And what does ten years mean to you, Reader? How distant is your idea of 2011 from your idea of 2001 or 2021? I have no way of knowing how far in the future you are, but you are in the future. And if when you live is after the time of the angels, I think you should come back here for real, not just in my imagination, and I think you should see what you can do about the magic that we have such trouble keeping track of. We still have magic here, but it’s slipping away, and when magic slips away it seems to take with it the memory of how it was used? Or it starts to look like play? And it could be that this has been happening forever, but definitely five years ago there was more public, casual, easy use of magic. My memories of a more magical world (a “more proximal universe,” as we used to say—and we weren’t trying to be poetic, just putting words to a thing) come mostly from what I wrote down. And even where I wrote things down, now when I read certain bits it just seems off. I ask myself if I was joking, or just trying to be artsy, or what, but I can find no evidence that I wasn’t being serious. We manifested—individuals for individuals, collectives for collectives, communities for communities. And I used to think that if I tried to circumvent the angels they would catch me, that the fates must know all about me, but clearly the people of that age are like the people of this age in that the enfranchised ones, the ones who engineer the institutions, can’t be bothered to read a damn book once in a while unless the act of reading will confer power to exploit and manipulate others within the bounds of their institutions. So hey, future-dwellers, travel back in time and confer your blessings upon me, please, so that I might thrive and help my peers and contemporaries to thrive as well! And yeah, also, to anyone reading this book between the time of my writing it and the invention of time travel, please preserve this book, because I’m trying to get it to someone, okay? Unfortunately, Salma is not one for dancing, and the Basement is pretty much all about dancing. She doesn’t want to stay. We consider all our options and end up at Hugo’s. Harry decides that he doesn’t mind leaving the Basement to go there. Salma ends up talking to the guy next to her at the bar, who she does not realize is Alix’s ex, Derrick, for much of the night, while I talk about, eh, like, Tim Burton and superhero movies with Harry. Salma invites me to sleep over and cuddle with her, but I just go back to Chicopee instead. 149 Alix scheduled her birthday dinner and after-dinner party on the night after my birthday—a Saturday—when, as I had told her, Esther is taking me out to a comedy show and I was thinking of getting other folks together afterward. Given that it would be hard to ask the same crowd to come out for two nights in a row, I feel I’ve in effect been disinvited from my own birthday gathering. 150 It’s just before nine o’clock at night. Earlier in the evening I called in to my work and took a paid sick day for the first time ever, due to a cold. I’ve been napping on the couch in my mother’s living room. I’m half-asleep, having just stirred, having just picked up my phone and checked out my most recent emails. Nothing interesting… I hear my mother. “I think Pepé just died,” she says. “What!” “He collapsed. The ambulance is here. ” The next thing I know, I’ve run downstairs. I stand out of the way. My aunt Renee is there with my Memé, who is shrieking: “He’s dead!” and, seemingly spoken to God, “You took him…” I stand where I can, leaving room for the EMTs. My Memé is calling her children on the phone. CPR is being performed in the bedroom. There is no such thing as time. The people who are running in and out: I don’t know how many of them there are, but they are seemingly all men my age, and I think of the various people I have met socially who have said that they do this sort of thing for a living, and I look the EMTs over, half expecting to know them, half expecting that I will run into them a week hence and a bar and say, “Yeah, I saw you there when my grandfather died. ” I will later hear that before anything else my Memé ran up the stairs at a speed she would have never thought possible and that she yelled to my mother and that my mother, who has never been trained in CPR, ran downstairs and tried to do CPR on my grandfather, who had fallen loudly onto the bed. My mother would later say that she didn’t remember in the moment that I was trained in CPR, that she didn’t know what she was doing, that she didn’t know that she should have moved him to the floor. And I will try to decide whether I would have remembered what to do. Let’s see, keep your arms straight. Over the center of the ribcage. Keep going while someone else calls the emergency number. While standing to the side, I have enough presence of mind to think that I should be doing something useful, and the best I can come up with is to offer to drive, and to grab water and a couple of bags of snack food for us to take with us to the hospital. I overhear from the people working on my grandfather that they have “a good rhythm” and I have hope. My mother, grandmother and aunt all seem to feel certain that he is doomed, so I decide that I will have hope. Superstitiously, a part of me believes in the moment that this hope might make a difference—that believing he has a chance will give him a chance. He is carried out and loaded into the ambulance. My mother says that she can drive, it’s okay. And on the car ride I’m handed everyone’s phones, and I’m calling my aunt Kim, whom no one has reached yet. There is still no answer. So I call Kim’s daughter, my cousin Katie, and I tell her what is happening. She says she can get in touch with Kim. And she does, and I answer the phone when Kim calls, and I tell her what hospital we’re going to. And Katie texts me to say that she could not handle being at the hospital, that she wants me to keep her updated by text message. We are given a special room next to the regular emergency room waiting area. More and more of us are coming. It’s a large extended family. Eight children, sixteen(?) grandchildren, eight(?) great-grandchildren. So by the time it’s later in the night, there are usually about a dozen of us there, as different people come and go. It was a massive heart attack, we’re told. He is seventy-seven years old. He had two heart attacks before, one in 1989 and one sometime around—everyone tries to remember—the year 2000? He smoked cigarettes for decades before finally quitting, had a multiple bypass surgery. We see him in the ER, hooked up to a machine that is keeping him breathing. I look at the monitor. Low blood pressure. They’re just keeping him alive to keep him alive, aren’t they? This round of professionals who have handled him have done their job successfully. At some point someone else will take a fresh look at him. This is all so that everyone can say their goodbyes, isn’t it? His son Glenn is quick to get angry and to feel that the hospital is not doing enough. It seems like it is because of his asking questions that my grandfather is moved up somewhat quickly from the ER to the cardiac ICU. We too are then moved upstairs to a different waiting room, where strangers are sleeping. There is a television. Prince is on George Lopez’s talk show. Prince? Since when does Prince go on talk shows? And he chose that show, out of all the talk shows? The television is on mute. I wonder what Prince is saying. I wonder how Prince comes across on TV in the year 2011. And then the actor Rosario Dawson. She’s beautiful. See how television steals our attention, distracts us, pulls us and keeps us away from life? I look around at my family. I don’t communicate much with them. I wish I knew how to. They don’t know what’s up with me. They don’t know that I am on a good path. They don’t know that I’m flying away. More relatives arrive. Decisions have to be made. Doctors come in and speak and surprise me with how forthcoming they are with the information they have. Not everyone in the room can follow the vocabulary the doctors use, but it becomes obvious to all that we are basically being advised to give up. My grandfather is going to die. His brain was without oxygen—not for incredibly long—this is when my mother is thinking, could she have done better, being the first to try to give him CPR, could she have remembered to call me? Could I, Levi Adams, have saved his life? If the cardiac surgeons went in, saw what they could do, then, if they could do anything to help him, he could be moved and some other doctors could see what was going on in his brain. More of a chance that he would die than that he wouldn’t, heart-wise. An even smaller chance, if all went well with that, that he would make a meaningful recovery, brain-wise. “How many patients have you seen in your career?” asks my frantic, doctor-distrusting uncle, Glenn. “Almost a million,” answers the doctor, who looks exhausted. Why don’t doctors get more sleep? I’m a smart guy. I think I would be willing to become a doctor, a specialist, if it were possible to work half their hours and earn half their pay. But be sleep deprived for thirty years and then retire well? Not worth it to me. I would rather have a work-life balance and never retire. Why does the doctor not suggest that we should do whatever we can to try to keep my grandfather alive? The family is already emotionally exhausted, and we know that he did not want to be kept artificially alive, if it came to that. He wanted to be independent. He wanted to be able to work. This is how it’s going to be: he worked until the day that he died. Did he work today? No, I don’t think so. The ambulance was called twice earlier in the day, because sort of the same thing happened, but his vitals were fine by the time anyone arrived. And his wife, Memé, my grandmother, thought it was either a heart attack or stroke. But he had said no, no, don’t worry. And he had been sick, seemingly with a cold, seemingly with the same cold that I have, but unlike me he had been vomiting. And he had a history of avoiding medical treatment. He had refused to be taken in and observed. He was not an organ donor; he had said not to have him cut up or else he would haunt us. Everyone in New England believes in ghosts. My mother keeps asking me if I want to leave. Other family members have come to the hospital and then have left. I say no, and I stick around for as long as she does. The next morning I don’t tag along. Too many of us, and I’m only a grandchild. I can give the eight children their chance to be there. All the time I was in the hospital I could have been mistaken for a mess, being sick, using so many tissues. Pepé dies while I’m at home streaming random crap on Netflix. The second and last of my grandfathers to go. A week before my thirtieth birthday. I already have scheduled lots of time off from work to surround my birthday. I now get four days of paid bereavement time. 151 I turn thirty. 152 I quit smoking cigarettes. 153 The neighborhood in Tuscaloosa, Alabama where my father has been living gets torn apart by a tornado. While my father hides in his apartment, the roofs are torn off buildings directly across the street from him, killing the inhabitants. 154 I plan a vacation alone to Hawaii. "

    "body": "18 Sep. 21, 2009. I’ve done some going out. There’ve been good nights and bad nights. Waiting for a good first assignment to take now that I’m finally on the substitute list for one of the districts I’m starting at. It has been two days, and I’ve had options both days, but I wasn’t about to jump in by doing kindergarten or middle school special ed, neither of which I’ve done before. 19 “You talk funny,” said a fourth grader. Me trying to explain an assignment to a class of kindergarteners was comedy gold. Third grade and up was fine. Below that I just didn’t know what to do, even with teachers and sometimes a paraprofessional there. Wednesday through Friday I had covered at the computer lab at Amherst Regional High School. Today I made the plunge into grade school, covering for the art teacher at Pelham Elementary. I don’t think I’ll be doing grade school anymore. Without having taken any education classes, I’m not the ideal person to be responsible for little kids. But anyway, I checked my voice mail during the prep period, and Office Team, a temp agency I had set myself up with, had given me a call with a job lead. “Data entry, light filing, and maybe some telephone work,” is how it was described to me. The job is with ACORN Housing. ACORN is a non-profit network of organizations providing assistance to the poor. It has lately been in the national news, lost a lot of funding, and come under investigation after right-wingers correctly surmised that if they went into different offices claiming to be a pimp and prostitute involved in human trafficking they would sometimes end up with accommodating responses from staff members. “Sounds interesting!” I say. 20 Oct. 1, 2009. My Internet provider decided to mistakenly disconnect my service, so I’m writing this is a notebook on my bed. I’ve more or less been meeting my goal of one page of fiction per day. This is good, but it has led to me typically falling short of my other daily goal, which was to get some substantial exercise every day. I’m pretty sure I need to reverse those priorities. I’m rebuilding my life from less than scratch. I would still like to tell the world to choose compassion, acceptance, and appreciation toward other humans beings. This is what I remain committed to. But I am also back to that place where I can barely say anything. I want to be held. 21 A first date with a woman named Jen. I’ll call her Teacher Jen. She saw me at the World War II Club, recognized me from my OKCupid profile, and asked me out through that site. She was born in the same hospital I was and shares my birthday (but not my birth year—she is four years younger). We engaged each other well in conversation, and I had a good time with her, but I got the feeling we’d do better as friends. (I’m not saying this is the reason we’d do better as friends, but I saw that she owned a copy of the book He’s Just Not That Into You. Upon seeing this I found myself blurting out the words, “One day I will have a death match with that book, and I will win!”) 22 ACORN Housing let me go when I didn’t show up on Columbus Day. I didn’t know I was supposed to be there! So long, OfficeTeam assignments, I figure. It’s a shame: it was looking like that was going to be the temp agency that actually gave me assignments, and potentially good ones. Now I’m scrambling to find other work; I’m less than enthralled with substitute teaching. Human services work would be the best case scenario, especially since my latest seemingly random idea is to go back to community college and start taking prerequisites in the Spring semester, then apply to Masters in Occupational Therapy programs in the hopes of starting in the fall of 2011. 23 I have plenty of fun to look forward to this weekend, and that’s not even counting the big order of books I have coming in from Powell’s. (“The Convalescent” by Jessica Anthony, “Drinking Coffee Elsewhere” by ZZ Packer, “Firmin” by Sam Savage, “Everything Matters!” by Ron Currie, Jr. , and “St. Lucy’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves” by Karen Russell. ) Of course, I already have a queue of stuff that I’ve been meaning to finish reading or get around to starting… but yeah, I got carried away with trading in some of my no-longer-wanted used books for credit. 24 I start training for a seasonal position doing customer service for the LEGO Group. When people in North America call about their LEGO toys or want to place an order over the phone, they’ll reach this call center in Enfield, Connecticut. Several things about this gig are refreshing, if you don’t think too long about the fact that it involves me doing telephone work yet again. I work for LEGO itself rather than for some outsourced call center. All those cool sculptures made up of LEGO blocks are made just downstairs from where I’ll be taking calls. There are three different buildings that are part of this center, and in the other buildings are, I don’t know, different corporate departments. We get 24 hour access to the company gym and to the lounge area where video game systems are set up and all of that. The culture seems good, dress is casual, and at a starting rate of $11. 50 per hour, this job is tied with Netflix in Oregon for the highest starting pay I’ve seen this type of work command. On Halloween night much of my training class is dressed up in costume. The head trainer is dressed up as Pebbles from the Flintstones. One kid is in a banana costume. The guy who sits next to me, another college graduate, has his hair up in a purple fauxhawk, but by the end of the night he grows tired of it and works out the spray-in color with his hands. He collects the purple powder in a bandana on his desk. 25 My shoes were falling apart, and wearing them everywhere really wasn’t okay anymore, so once the paycheck for my week of training came in I went and bought new ones. Then I had to hit my mother up for money for the rest of the week. Today was a family gathering; it was Chris and Ken’s twenty-ninth birthday. I went downstairs at a few points, but I often found myself returning upstairs to look up information and plan and consider occupational therapy school vs. an occupational therapy assistant program. Then, after everyone had left, I could hear my mother and Bruce having one of their disputes through the wall, so I packed my computer and drove off to Amherst, where I now sit in a corner at Rao’s. 26 I went on another date from OKCupid the other day. The woman’s name was Esther. She lives in (and has always lived in) Connecticut. It seems she messaged me initially because she wanted to talk literature with me. She’s an accountant. And the weird thing? She goes to a really conservative church. But I rolled with it and made it an opportunity for good conversation. And it was good conversation. And I like to find that once in a while. 27 A second date with Esther happens the next weekend (on Saturday, November 15, 2009). This time, we meet for dinner at the Northampton Brewery. Here is me, wearing a nicotine patch… yes, I’ve been wearing those, sometimes, when I’m able to bring myself that day to remember to try to quit smoking. I first tried patches when I started substitute teaching this time around, because, y’know, I remembered how crappy it felt to be in charge of kids while secretly fiending for a cigarette. In 2009 smoking is totally low-class and unprofessional (in addition to being, as always, nasty and once of the most destructive things a person can do to their health). But anyway, with Esther at the Northampton Brewery, yeah. And she doesn’t eat more than a couple of bites, which makes me uneasy. (So I ask her several questions about this: Was she not hungry? Did she not like the food?) But I’ve had her talking at length about comedy, which she’s really into. And then we try coffee at the Haymarket, but there’s nowhere to sit. So then we’re on the steps of the city hall, but as it has been drizzling out, everything is wet there, and drops falling from above are annoying. But I guess it clears up and we walk and we’re back at Haymarket and the conversation is pretty good and then we move on to the Tunnel Bar, where we luck into some chairs, but apparently there’s no more getting waited on? Or maybe that’s just because it’s Saturday night. And I joke, “You’re a classy gal; I can take you to the Tunnel Bar,” but once we’re there it doesn’t seem classy at all. And I’m like, “Um… well, this used to be a sort of fancy cigar bar. But things change, I guess. ” And in the parking lot where we both have parked she hugs me in an enthusiastic and not-letting-go sort of way that I really wasn’t expecting. And it’s from a weird sort of angle, with sort of a lot of room between us, but she’s just squeezing me close from the shoulders up and saying, “You’re a good hugger,” which is usually true about me, although, at the moment she says this, I’m more, like, falling over. 28 On Thursday, with Esther, there is dinner at Fitzwilly’s, then trivia at WWII. But we’re too late to the WWII to be participants, so we just follow along on our own at the bar. After the game is over and the night has turned to karaoke, I’ve had my three slowly-drunk drinks, and she has has her two even-more-slowly-drunk drinks, and I grab a table for us in the corner, and I think there’s a moment when she observes some small, unconscious movement of my face—like, me looking at her lips in some way, maybe, or moving my head somehow—and there was some unspoken and immensely subtle something that was communicated in that moment before she just completely, suddenly threw herself into moving in and kissing me wildly. I suggested that we walk, and it was stopping and kissing, and on her car it was her leaning against it and pulling me while we kissed, and she had suggested earlier in the night that the next time we get together should be the Saturday after Thanksgiving and I should come over to her place and she should cook for me. “So we’ll do the Saturday after Thanksgiving,” she says. “Okay. See you in… a week a half, I guess,” being open about how curious it seems to me to have her be all rarr like this and then set the next date for a full nine days later. 29 I say, “Eureka!” when I come up with a five year plan, also known inside my head as “The Plan To Become a Career Professional By My Jesus Year”, or, “Finally, a Plan That Takes Into Consideration the Fleeting Nature of Life and the Inevitability of Old Age, But Also Looks Holistically, So To Speak, Doing What It Can To Strike a Balance and To Understand That Shit is Going To Be Really Fucking Difficult and Even At Times Perhaps Horrible But Really, Dead End and Low-Paying Work For the Rest of My Life is Not the Answer”. 30 I take a number and wait at the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Then I realize that I don’t have cash with which to pay for a new registration… just before my number is called. So I take a new number and drive to the ATM and wait again, only to remember just before my number is called that I forgot to print out the form that I needed from my car insurance provider. I work, and that’s fine… then, after work, I know that Alix has said she and Flip would be at Bishop’s Lounge for their open mic—they’re both going to play—and so I get on I-91 in Enfield and don’t get off until Northampton. As always, to get to Bishop’s I go in the outer door, pass the entrance to the Sierra Grille, go all the way up the stairs, and show my identification to the person who is sitting, reading a book. I head to the bar and just happen to find that I’m walking towards Alix. “Hey there,” I say. “Levi!” she says, “I missed you!” I think it has only been a couple weeks? Even when Alix and I do get to see each other, it only sometimes feels close or important. But I appreciate that she’s saying this. Brandon is there, too—Brandon, a UMass student I only met recently. Tonight was his first time playing any open mic. I’m sorry that I missed it, but yeah, I work until ten, so, y’know. We grab space out on the balcony, Alix, Brandon, Flip and I. If you go out the door to the balcony, then go left, all the way down at the end, that’s where we were. At some point Gaby showed up and said to us, “Hello, people I know!” She stood around and talked for a bit, with the others and with me. She works second shift at the front desk of a hotel now, says she is just waiting and hoping to be let go so she can collect unemployment. Amelia (whom, you may recall, I originally knew through Zella) showed up—it turns out that she and Gaby are living together now—and Amelia is saying something about having her trombone stolen, and I’m like, “Yeah, I remember that,” and she’s like, “No, I don’t mean that time,” and I’m like, “You’ve had two different trombones stolen?” And she’s like, “No, that was my baritone that you’re thinking of. ” And Flip was like, “Who steals a baritone?” and she talks briefly about how it was taken from the trunk of her unlocked car the time we went to Montreal. She’s avoiding eye contact with me as if she knows horrible things about me that I don’t even know about myself. But I won’t let that bother me. I got the hint the last time I ran into her. It presumably has to do with whatever the reason is for Zella no longer talking to me either. Flip performed Leonard Cohen’s “Hey, That’s No Way To Say Goodbye” and a couple of other tunes that I don’t think I know. Alix did two Tom Waits songs plus “Hit the Road, Jack”. (I apologize, Reader, for getting my tenses confused. ) I impressed myself the next day by waking up early yet again. I made it to the DMV, waited again, got to the counter, went through everything, then was told that the cost was actually $125 rather than the $50 I had been planning for. (I had been looking at the cost for a new registration, but had not known/had forgotten that the title would be separate. ) But I was able to run to the ATM again, get the rest of the cash that I needed, and have my transaction finished by the same teller without needing to wait again for my number to be called. At work (having on my first break tossed my cigarettes into the car glove box, and having used the pair of scissors that I keep in there to cut open the pouch of a new nicotine patch, and having applied the patch to my upper arm) things are going decently, as usual, although it’s still stupid that I of all people should ever do phone work let alone have phone work be the type of work that I am considered most qualified to do. I field one call from a woman in Arizona who makes the call especially deep and heavy, talking about how her niece died this year, and how she’s buying these LEGO sets for her son, and she really has had a difficult year financially, and maybe she shouldn’t add anything else to the order, but she’ll use the money she would otherwise spend on herself, because life is short and you never know when you’re going to go and there’s nothing that she might spend her money on that would be more important than seeing her son happy. And the call goes on for a bit, and at the end of it she says something like, “You sound like you’re young, still in your twenties, maybe at a point where you’re thinking of starting a family of your own soon…” (She only sounds like she’s in, oh, I would guess her mid-thirties. ) And then she gives me some advice, but now that I try to write it down, I forget what that advice was, exactly. And soon enough I was home, not (as would usually be the case) removing the nicotine patch and beginning to smoke now that I had gone without smoking for the duration of a work shift. And I got home, thought about food, sort of really wanted to go to Denny’s and get their chicken tenders, for some reason… but I didn’t. In fact, I just sort of was lying there for a bit, on the bed, knowing that I would feel more normal if I had a cigarette, but also feeling that there was nothing I could do with that cigarette-power that would be life-saving, life-changing, or necessary. It’s good, I think to myself, That I resisted going to Denny’s. Denny’s would have cost me like ten dollars… and ten dollars not spent is something. And at 1:40 AM, after going to sleep around 11 PM, I feel ready, even eager and excited, to begin my day, and truly disappointed when I find that it is not even close to daylight yet. The dream I have just woken from happened as follows: I have found myself tentatively welcomed by a group of people that either lives or gathers on a strange estate. They all seem very casual, and at first I believe that I am just hanging out, but as time goes by it becomes apparent that as they gather, put on art performances, hold seminars and so on, they have serious business on their mind. It’s seriousness about living well. Strangely, I trust this. And there was something like a party, yet it was also an evaluation of me, and also a formulation of plans, a formulation of what they are doing, their greater purpose. I leave but I’m lost, crawling around, and I end up on a beach where hundreds are relaxing and frolicking in the nude, and a woman comes by and jokes, “You’re taking a free peek at my nudes!” and then I climb (for this is like a castle) and pass a window belonging to someone else, and she is taking care of a child, cooking, talking on the phone in the kitchen… and when I get somewhat close, happening to be climbing around the outside of the window, what is like a spring-loaded hand (but is magic) jumps in front of me, like an alarm system. But at the end I am thanked for my participation, my introduction to and evaluation by this community… and I have been given an honest appraisal of myself, that I am “very nervous”… and this makes me worry, really worry about whether any of what I am trying to do with myself in real life is realistic… but I am also given positive feedback, and hopeful words are spoken about how I might in the future be able to be a full participant. And I am given applause. And I wake up, thinking about that castle. Then I make a Sunshine Burger in a wrap, sit up for awhile, fill out a FAFSA and get it sent to STCC. Then I fall asleep again, then I awake and hang out downstairs with the Thanksgiving food for a bit while finishing Ron Currie, Jr. ’s novel Everything Matters! upstairs. It’s about time for me to switch nicotine patches—24 hours have gone by—but for the moment I don’t, just in case I might be able to tolerate the withdrawal. But instead of being able to stand it, it only takes a few hours before I’ve found myself unable to focus on anything, sitting on the floor, all but rocking back and forth, half watching the television but mostly just compelled to pace. I buy some cigarettes, smoke some, sleep some, am awake some, am awake during the night, sleep in the morning before work, and on my break at work go back to the patch. I wear that for a day. (Friday night I turn in early. ) And I only have, oh, I don’t know, four cigarettes on Saturday before I go over to Esther’s. I stay over at her place, and throughout the night I’m again seeing how much, and how vividly I dream when I’m on the nicotine patch. I dream that I’m walking through the mall and accidentally call up Bluejay, who returns the call, and I apologize to them for unfriending them on social networking sites after I came back here from Portland. And I wake up and it’s still night and I go to the bathroom to pee and I’m thinking about Portland and in that moment it seems silly that I should want to go back to where the job market is always so tough. But this is just middle of the night, sleeping on the patch kind of stuff. And in the morning there’s coffee, and then Esther is rolling out of bed and I watch her dress from complete nakedness to that in which she will be teaching Sunday school and then attending church. I get back to Chicopee and my mom is cooking soup in the kitchen. It feels so wrong not having my own space, and I think again about all the money I will need to spend in the future, but for now I am spending very little. My mother takes care of my food, I bring lunch to work, and I resist going out for anything when I can bring myself to. The cavities in my teeth hurt. My recurring tooth pain—which at times incapacitates me with its awfulness—was a big part of what led me back here to Massachusetts. I drink more coffee. "

    "body": "31 Salma, now in Turkey, was supposed to meet me online an hour and a half ago. She has been emailing for the past couple of days, having been lonely, wanting to find a time to talk. I have plans to head to Esther’s apartment tomorrow after work, spend the night, then head with her down to New Haven, then catch a train to Manhattan, then I dunno, then see the Fiery Furnaces at the Bowery Ballroom, then, presumably, take the train back to New Haven and then back to her place in Hartford via automobile to Esther’s house. On Wednesday night, Alix and I managed to have a one-on-one dinner. In theory this was supposed to be us “catching up”, and I guess we did catch up in some respects, Mostly it was so chill and casual that it didn’t really seem quite serious enough to qualify as “catching up”, although at one point I asked her, “Should I become a social worker?” and she said, “Yes,” just as immediately as she had replied, “No,” a couple of months before when I had asked, “Should I become an occupational therapist?” Within the past week I moved on to the second step nicotine patch. The transition has led to more cheating, having cigarettes rather than just hanging in there and not smoking… (“cheating”, even though I don’t really recall when I transitioned to getting serious about wanting not to smoke anymore at all. I’ve lost most of my ability to discern how much time has passed. ) Trying to fix myself in about seven hundred thousand ways at once. Trying to not smoke, to not spend money, to exercise… I’ve been measuring how well I’ve been doing with not smoking based on how much money I have saved from the usual pecuniary cost of my nicotine addiction. This is a good way to do it, I think. But DAMN I am an addict. 32 I went with Esther to New York in early December as planned; we met up with her friend Cliff there and the girl he is seeing. We walked to a place that served cheap mixed drinks, and we had a few, and although I was on the patch I asked Cliff for one of his cigarettes and joined him on a smoke break and he and I talked about music. Then Esther and I walked to the Bowery Ballroom and saw the Fiery Furnaces and it was great, and we took the train back to New Haven, and then she drove us back to her place in Hartford, where we slept. And in the morning she left first, but then I wasn’t entirely successful at waking up and I had to call in and use an hour of personal time so that I wouldn’t be considered late for the overtime shift I had signed up for. I’m registered for one graduate class at Westfield State and two classes at Springfield Technical Community College. That should keep me busy, as if I needed to be kept busier. I’m not sure what I’ll be doing for work once my seasonal position at LEGO ends, but I at least know that I’m still signed up as a substitute at the Amherst schools, and I can call that temp agency once I’m available and see if they want to give me anything. 33 Alyssa, who has been my step-sister for the past five years or so (and who is still a teenager) is up from Florida. Something tells me that coming to the dark, frozen North for Christmas probably seems less than ideal to her, but she doesn’t seem miserable or anything. At one point, I step out into the kitchen to grab some water, and she calls me into the living room: “Levi!” She’s having trouble with the computer. She can’t make the @ symbol. I show her that she needs to use the shift key… She must have known how to use the shift key, right? But she’s sitting in the dark at my mother’s laptop, so maybe she just wasn’t finding the keys right. I open up my combination-locked box of hardcover, privately vanity-printed volumes of my life story. I start reading from close to the end of what I have printed out. Then I read what I have typed up but not had printed yet. I have requested information for some more volunteer positions. I have drunk a small amount of wine. I go for a walk with my iPod through a cold-but-not-as-bad-as-it-could-be December night. 34 Christmas involves relatives. Crowded downstairs. Standing. Maybe grabbing a seat for a while when one is vacant. 35 I return to work on the day after Christmas, taking calls. I am pleasantly surprised to find that although the call volume is indeed high I do not need to deal with as many evil, angry customers as I expected I would. Because 10 to 6 is the standard schedule for weekend shifts (as opposed to my usual 2 to 10) I am out at a reasonable time for what humans call “dinner”. I have agreed to head over to Esther’s to eat some delicious homemade food. (I agreed, although I became anxious about the idea once she added, “Oh, and is it okay if I invite my friends Chris and Megan over, too?” Because I have not met them yet. I have not met anyone in her life except her friend Cliff in New York and his girlfriend. ) I wish that I had woken up in time this morning to wash my hair… but as I rolled out of bed, what happened was, the time on my clock informed me that I would need to choose between hair-washing and face-shaving, and I chose to do the latter. So, whatever. I feel a little gross. So at Esther’s I’m nervous and actually feeling rather tired, having only managed some four or five hours of sleep. But I seem to be managing not to make too much of an ass of myself. And Esther, as usual, is doing what may as well from my perspective be some spooky alchemical things in the kitchen, running behind schedule, putting together some really great food. And Chris has brought beer that was brewed at a brew-your-own place. Brewing beer is a hobby of his, one that he is working to expand upon. Megan is his wife, a substance abuse social worker. And dinner goes on, and on, but oh, sleep, oh, sleep. And I’m venturing to speak less and less, and I’m thinking, oh, sleep, oh, sleep, oh. Zzzz. (Explanation: I am writing this after lying down to sleep and taking a sleep aid and lying down for a bit longer and then starting to feel like I was falling asleep and then getting up and going to the bathroom and then feeling TOTALLY AWAKE after that bathroom run, but then realizing, also, as I then attempt to do something with my time other than lying around, that I am spaaaaacy. ) 36 All this back and forth of wearing a patch, then smoking, then smoking small amounts while wearing a patch, sort of seems to be messing with me. At least, maybe this is why I feel sort of blank, sort of incapable when I sit down and try to write about my life again. 37 Saturday night, while I am in a bed in a condominium unit in Connecticut (trying to sleep, I thought I was going to sleep, I thought I was so tired and now I just can’t fall asleep) someone or someones goes on an arson spree in what I’ve long called my adoptive hometown, in my old neighborhood in Northampton. Some fires extinguished quickly, some houses burned, some cars destroyed. Two people dead. I find out about this while I’m at work the next day, and it’s by text message, and the thought of it bothers me through what is already a sort of annoying shift. I find myself trying to think of what people I’ve met might, if they snapped, derive joy from running around like Batman’s Joker, setting fires, it seems, indiscriminately. Lots of people connected to the center of that town must be thinking this. You sort of have to, when it’s this small place that you know well, which has long been full of people who are wacked out to varying degrees. 38 After work I’m still wanting to know more about the fires, where exactly they were, what is known, but as I leave work I turn on my phone and find that I’ve been left a voice mail. It’s Alix, suggesting that I pick her up from the studio in Easthampton she has been working at. I pick her up, listening to Hank Williams. I explain to her that I still haven’t gotten into him but that I’m trying to. About the arson, Alix says, “I hear people saying it was probably a teenager. But it wouldn’t have been a teenager. ” I agree that it probably someone more our age. Alix and I move on and have a lovely night, sitting at the Northampton Brewery. She orders a chicken salad, and I order a fish sandwich with fries. We each have a glass of cabernet sauvignon while a band plays in the next room. Utilizing our usual shared sense of humor (tough to explain, but typically involving absurd extremes of deadpan despair) we banter. We get coffees at Haymarket; I drop mine and the contents spill all over the coffeeshop’s entrance rug. Then I drop her back off at the studio, and I drive home. And on Monday I work and come home and apply to a couple of jobs and think about taking a walk, but you know how it goes… you’re going to get some exercise despite the biting cold western Massachusetts late December wind, but then you end up typing some personal journals, and the next thing you know, it’s 3:30 in the morning, and you figure you should probably start thinking about getting to sleep sometime soon. 39 My accomplishments today included ordering books for the graduate class I’m taking in the Spring; letting my soon-to-be-beginning health insurance know the name of the doctor I have somewhat randomly chosen to be my primary care provider; and stumbling upon information about and then purchasing two advance tickets to Sleep No More, a Macbeth-themed immersive theater piece going up in the Boston area. I have to figure out with whom to go. Ideally, I would like to take someone without telling them that they are going to a performance in which they will don a mask and wander labyrinthine hallways full of dark subject matter. I also applied to one more job, albeit a bit half-assedly: it was one of those things where I was pretty sure I wouldn’t get around to applying to this one position at all if I didn’t just get it out of the way now, before New Year’s. I hope I can wake up early for tomorrow, so that I can be sure to pretty myself up thoroughly before going to work and then heading out among drunk people. 40 Working on New Year’s Eve, I discover that I am not the only one who sort of expected that we would (as on Dec. 23) be let out early. I’m disappointed to find that indeed we do need to work until 10 PM. As I leave the building, I ask the security guy whether it would be okay for me to leave my car there overnight. I’m told that this will be fine. I call Esther, who in trying to find my place of work has ended up in the wrong state. (This is less of an issue than it sounds, since she is still only one town over from where I’m waiting. ) As I wait for her to arrive I decide to use the time to gather some of the miscellaneous trash that is (as usual) making my car an embarrassing mess. I stuff things into a plastic bag from Target and place the bag in the trunk. Esther arrives and apologizes. I tell her the way to go so that we can get to the highway and head north to Northampton. Once there, we luck out and find parking. We get coffee drinks at Haymarket, then walk around to see what’s happening. The Sierra Grille is at capacity. Bishop’s Lounge has something going on but is charging a cover. At Pearl Street is Purity Supreme Presents Wooly Bully, which is indie kids dancing to songs that were already called “oldies: when their parents were young. It’s decent fun—I like having a variety of nightlife events around—but it’s like 11:15 and Esther and I have arrived in the middle of the night’s revelry, and Esther isn’t a dance club sort of gal, anyway. So we kind of just stand around for a bit, then she asks if I’d like a drink and I say, Sure, and we go to the bar and each get a drink and then we each (standing at the edge of the dance floor) have our one drink and I say, “We’ve got about fifteen minutes. Want to go out to the ball-raising?” Unlike the gigantic, always-televised annual ball drop in New York’s Times Square, Northampton, Massachusetts raises the ball in the minute before midnight. But this is a minor thing, really, compared to the odd fact that there is a large digital clock at the intersection in the town center where the ball-raising takes place, but this clock and the ball-raising are never quite in sync… and then there is just one small, like, single firecracker, or something, that goes off to signal that the new year has arrived. But one can’t help to expect, after that one Bang!, that there will be more. So there can be no countdown to scream out, or anything, because you’re in a crowd of several hundred people who have no clue exactly what time it is, or when they should celebrate. Wait. Was that it? Is it the new year? Some people are cheering. Okay, more people are cheering. I guess that must have been it, then. Happy 2010! Then Esther and I walk around for a bit, then we sit for a bit at Sam’s Pizza and Café. Then we go back to her place down in Connecticut, and we watch some of the bonus materials in her DVD set of The State. Then sleep, then waking up. And in the morning I just feel like having some time to myself. I feel confused, pretty sure that there is something I need to say to Esther, but I haven’t been able to get her to talk about what she thinks she’s looking for or what she thinks she’s doing with me or anything having to do with the two of us. I don’t know. I get dropped off at my car and drive back ‘home’ and heat up some soup and a sandwich. Then I head out to Amherst and sit in the Starbucks writing this, and I have to pee, and then maybe, I don’t know, maybe I’ll actually stick around here, waiting, until I hear from Alix about what’s going on tonight and whether we’ll be doing anything before heading out to the WWII. 41 It’s a pretty fun night at karaoke. Teacher Jen is there, at the next table with some friends. She kinda taps me on the shoulder and says hey and that we should hang out sometime. “Where’s Esther?” Alix asks me, as we’re sitting at a table and someone or other is singing something or other. “I didn’t invite her out,” I say, and the two of us kind of exchange looks. She says, “I liked her. I think you’re worrying too much about, whatever, having lifestyle differences with her, when it probably isn’t as big a deal as it seems to you. ” “It’s a bit of a moot point, though, because I’m not about to get into a relationship. ” “Still, I think you should just go with it, relax, and see what happens. ” “Did you meet Arden? You never met Arden, did you?” I blurt out, making a wine-assisted conversational leap. “No, I never met Arden. You loved her, didn’t you?” “Yeah. ” “She was a good one?” “Yeah, she was a good one. ” “Where is she now?” “Still in Pennsylvania, but she’s moving back to Maine soon. And she’s sort of already started seeing a woman who lives there. ” She nods. Throughout the night Alix and I off and on find ourselves having that sort of vulnerable type of personal talk that I almost feel, nowadays, like we who are not kids anymore are not supposed to have. And once I’m in bed for the night (in the same clothes that I’ve been wearing all day—this is still typical of me when I’m sleeping alone) I think back and feel embarrassed for the various tactless things that I said throughout the night. For example, when I asked Alix about her boyfriend, Flip: “Does he understand our friendship?” She: “I think so, for the most part. ” Me: “That’s good. I hope he knows that as long as he’s good to you, I won’t fuck you. ” Alix busts up laughing, both at the bluntness and because it is an uncharacteristic thing to come out of my mouth. Yes, and as I lie down to sleep I feel, as I do every day, the strongest urge to leave New England again, immediately, forever. I’m only back here in the area where I grew up so that I can try to make sure I will never have to do it again. And these months feel, socially like one long conversation with someone I’m sitting next to on an airplane: no matter how nice it gets, I still would vastly prefer not to be squished in an uncomfortable space, unable to move. I still would rather be at my destination. 42 On Saturday I drive the couple of hours that it takes to get me to Saratoga Springs, New York. I park the car in a space that is marked as two hour parking, texting myself the time so that I can go and move it when the two hours are up. I love going to towns and cities I haven’t been to before, because I can’t help it—I consider everything that I see, every person that I purchase food or beverage from, as representing the new place. That’s right, employees at the pizza shop: through you I am judging your town, so you’d better do it justice! I only spend two hours in Saratoga Springs. After a slice of pizza and some time sipping coffee at a coffee shop I go back to my car. It isn’t super ultra cold outside, but it’s still January, still well below freezing and a bit windy, and this is what keeps me from taking the sort of leisurely, ‘I-wonder-what-I-can-find’ stroll around town that I would usually take. 43 I have two full weeks before I begin taking classes. My work situation is up in the air: when I and the others in my training class began this job we were told that we would be working until probably the end of the January, although “sometimes people stay on”. It’s like that. So, the sending out of resumes is something that I’m doing now, and that I will be doing a lot of during the next couple of weeks. My health insurance (through the commonwealth of Massachusetts) began on January 1, and I’ve chosen my primary care physician, so now I may as well try to make an appointment. I don’t really know what you call it when you go to a see a doctor for the first time. Is it still a check-up if you’ve never met the physician before? Also, getting corrective eyewear and filling 7,000 cavities are on my agenda for the near future. 44 Teacher Jen invites me over to her place in Sunderland. It’s still Saturday, January 2. We watch 9, the computer-animated Tim Burton movie. The movie sort of just flashes by and seems to be over in an instant, before I can make heads or tails, really, of what the plot is supposed to be. She says that she talked to Alix the other week at the club… that she hadn’t talked to Alix before, but that Alix had said something like, “I can’t trust anyone if they don’t like Levi. He’s just so nice and open-minded. ” It’s nice to hear that good things are being said about me. "

    "body": "45 Days pass, and by Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2010, I’m feeling sort of burnt out and ready for my work week to be over. Am I doing well at this job? I’ve been doing this sort of work for the better part of three years now, and it is not a sort of work that I as a person have much inherent talent for doing well, except that I am usually articulate, never rude, and always hard-working. I want a hug by the time I’m taking my last break. I text Esther, asking if she would like some company. I go over and she heats up one of the leftover chicken pot pies that she made when she had me and Megan and Chris over, back whenever that was. And we talk about whatever, and we lie down to go to sleep. She starts snoring, but me, well… Lately, as I’ve been tossing and turning in bed at night, I’ve been flashing back to scenes from the various places I’ve been. I think back to routines that in the past I established, routines that I still can long for but that for reasons of distance I can’t (at least for now) return to. So I think about that little deli in Seattle that I used to go on lunch breaks. I had hour long lunches, then. How I would order my sandwich, and as they prepared it, I, better dressed for work than I was used to being dressed, would stand, with my long, black coat hanging around me, gazing into the rows of beverage coolers to decide for myself what I wanted to purchase and drink that day. And I would text friends who were thousands of miles away, telling them how I missed them, and that missing them was troubling, and that I wished I could bring them all with me. And I think of mornings in Portland, when I would wake up at Karen’s and roll out of bed far earlier than she did, and how I would boil water and make coffee into my portable mug, pouring into one of those non-electric conical filter things, or else sometimes get in my car and drive a few streets down, park just off of Hawthorne and walk to get coffee and an egg and cheese bagel at the bubble tea place. In the morning, after Esther has left, I eventually pick myself up out of bed and shower. One I leave her apartment complex I’m locked out, and I realize at this point that I’ve left my phone inside. I want to find somewhere to spend my time before work that will have both coffee and wi-fi, but I cannot. I sit at Denny’s, drink some coffee and juice, and scribble into a tiny little notebook that I forgot I had. Before work I stand outside in the little covered thing outside that is there as a smoking area. I don’t remember his name, just as I don’t remember the names of most of the co-workers I commonly interact with. He talks about things that are stressing him out today, but how he’s going to try to leave that at the door. A friend in prison whom he has been trying to get to have an extended conversation with, and other things. And he says to me, when he’s done talking about this, “Sorry for dumping that on you. You make it easy. You’re easy to talk to, somehow. ” And I say, “No, don’t apologize. I like it. ” Which is true. Then I work, and work is refreshingly okay—stressful at times, of course, but I feel able to take it on, and there are those stretches of however many calls at a time when I get into the groove and enjoy talking to people and don’t have to fake it to sound interested and engaged and fun. It does not feel today like I am trying to stop myself from having a panic attack. On the last break, I’m smoking again: yesterday was the first day when I convinced myself, after several days of my feeling crappy and anxious throughout my shift, that gradually reducing my daily nicotine intake by means of the patch might just be too harmful, too bad for my ongoing project of feigning steadiness (feigning normalcy) to be feasible at this point. So I’m in the relapse zone and on my way through the full pack of cigarettes that I’m going to smoke this day, and the same guy who talked to me about his having a lot on his mind comes out and says hey and tells me that actually, he’s feeling better, that it just so happened that some of the calls he took were good and that he found himself laughing with the customers and that it was strange, it was like it was one of those rare situations when work actually improved his mood. And I’m like, Yeah, you never know, it can end up being a good thing, talking on the phone all day, because it’s social, you’re talking to people, but it’s luck of the draw, it’s random who you’ll get. And when our break-time smokers’ chit-chat hits a lull and we’re both quiet I take rare conversational initiative by asking him whether he has managed to successfully trade a shift with anyone yet, at this job. He tells me that he has tried to do this but never succeeded. I explain that I’ve signed up for some classes that are beginning in a couple of weeks, but that I forgot to pass on information about my availability changes earlier, so there’s one day that I need to get off, either by swapping a shift or by using up some of my personal time. “What are the classes for?” he asks. “Well, I have a Bachelor’s in English,” I say, “But as I was getting it, I wasn’t really doing anything to make it lead to a career. So I’ve been doing jobs like this… but I figure I need to go for something else, so I’m taking prerequisites, thinking I’ll prepare to maybe go for a program in social work. ” He talks about someone he knows who works in the field. I ask some questions about her work. He says to me, “You’d be good with that. I barely know you, but still, I get that impression. ” I thank him and we both walk inside. I get into my car after work, hurrying to get the ignition turned and the heat going, and from the next car I hear, “Levi!” And at first I figure it’s a co-worker who needs some help with her car or something, but when I see the person it’s Esther, who has brought my phone. “Do you want to stop at Denny’s for a bit, or something?” I ask, feeling like, now that she’s here, I don’t want to just take my phone and have us go our separate ways. She agrees, and there (by the way, Reader, that was an intentional paragraph break) and there she talks about how she doesn’t know much about rock music because her parents… “Here’s where it gets a little crazy,” she says, embarrassed to talk more about her family, who are still the center of her life. “My parents sort of think rock music is evil. ” I nod. This does not really register as new information to me, because from what she already has said about her parents, I would not have guessed them to be, say, Black Sabbath fans. The Esther I am seeing as I get to know her seems really dedicated to trying to make room for both her secular interests and a set of personal beliefs that keeps her engaged in and dedicated to a community—(not just her family, but the church ties she shares with her family)—that is really kind of its own, separate, seemingly incompatible thing. I’m dating a Baptist Sunday school teacher who owns both of David Cross’s stand-up albums. And I quietly distrusted her from the start because of her religiousness. And she’s an absolute sweetheart. And I try to push her away. And she knows I’m not staying. And I guess we’re each just learning from and trying to enjoy our time with each other. Which is maybe the best dating situation I could find myself in at this point, since my heart doesn’t let me be really casual but I’m not going to be in Massachusetts for very long and I don’t have the time or energy to devote to a relationship. I go home and write some more. I cough up gunk, the way I always used to do when I smoked all the time… And it comes back to me, all the disgusting side effects of smoking that actually have gone away since I began my attempts to quit. And I say to myself that I should just try going back to the step one patch, the one with the highest level of nicotine. A complete relapse into the life of a full-time cigarette smoker should be off the table at this point. And I’ve written on many things, and I have an appointment to get new prescription eyeglasses in the morning. And I’ve tapped into that bottle of wine that I opened on Christmas then left corked on the kitchen counter… and I’m tired… and I’m going to sleep. 46 I didn’t feel like heading out to karaoke tonight, but it turns out that Alix sort of sways me to, and I invite Esther, and she drives up and meets me there. Jill J. , whom I haven’t seen since Halloween, is present. Although she is sitting right next to me, I text her, because she is sitting at the table with her eyes glued to her new phone: “Do you know anyone who might want a roommate for just, like, four months?” She looks up from her phone and says to me, “Really?” Because, she says, her boyfriend is going to be moving in at some point within the next several months, but it’s not clear exactly when, and having me live there temporarily might just work out perfectly. I say that I’ll text her tomorrow and that we can work out a time for us to meet up, or whatever. As the night is winding down, Esther and I both drive down to her place in Connecticut, and we sleep there, and in the morning I go to work, and after work I head back down to my mother’s place and gather up some things that it would be convenient for me to have if I slept somewhere else for the next couple of nights. But I feel tired, and I do the thing where I lie down in bed and it seems like I’m falling asleep but then twenty minutes later I have to pee and then I’m completely awake again. Alix has told me that she going to karaoke again tonight, and I’ve told her that I probably won’t make it, but then I change my mind and just go. And it’s like, whatever. I’ve had what has felt like a long week involving few nights of quality sleep. I’m just going along with the night and have my mind to a large extent turned off. The crowd seems different tonight, and this has me feeling even more than usual that I don’t much care what any of these people think of me. As a result, not only do I sing, but my choices are “99 Problems” by Jay-Z and “Little Plastic Castle” by Ani DiFranco. Then it’s Sunday, and after I wake up I go to Jill J. ’s to talk about that possibility of my renting a room. She begins by saying that her boyfriend (whom she describes as “being from a different culture” because he is used to living in “places like New Jersey and Long Island”) finds it discomfiting to think of a male renting a room in his girlfriend’s apartment. Jill suggests that perhaps I should bring Esther along to hang out with her and him next weekend, because maybe seeing that will make me look like I am indeed not scheming to convince his girlfriend to leave him in favor of me (or whatever it is that his type worries might happen when women and men who are not dating do not remain segregated). And there are other things, too. The amount she would be looking for in rent is a little higher than I think the space would really be worth to me. I hang out at the Thirsty Mind for a bit before Jonny, with whom I’ve made arrangements to meet here, walks in. We sit around for a while and talk… …and then I go to Starbucks in Amherst and write… …and by the time I’m driving home I’ve had too much coffee, without really eating a whole bunch of food, and I sort of feel like I’m having a heart attack. But I guess I’m not. 47 Chest pains again tonight while driving home from work, and then sitting in front of the television, eating rice cakes, watching a re-cast of the debate for Massachusetts’ special Senate election. So I’ve long since taken off my nicotine patch as I sit at my computer, half trying to remember what tasks I wanted to complete tonight, half being occupied by the persisting urge to smoke a cigarette. The rice cakes were just an interim snack, so now I’m eating fish sticks. 48 I go to Esther’s after work, and on her couch it’s one of those things where I just have to confess that I haven’t been entirely comfortable with things being romantic with her, that I don’t really understand what we’ve doing or what she is looking for. And she cries, and she apologizes for crying, and she says that it’s just, she cries when she talks about something emotional. 49 I was working steadily on my novel for a few months there, back in the autumn. I just pulled out my manuscript of what I have (fifty-five to maybe seventy-five pages, depending on font) and I’m faced more strongly than ever with a certain sadness when I think of continuing to work on it. I write so slowly and meticulously, and yet, honestly… I mean, honestly, who cares? I mean, I feel like literary fiction authors have a prospective audience that is more or less equal to the number of people who want something personally or professionally from them. Am I wrong? I know how excited I get when I read a book that I enjoy, but even that can seem like a false joy. It’s like, Yay! Thank you, wonderful writer! Now if only there were a few hundred million more people who saw the world as we do, we might start to make a practical difference instead of just hollering to each other across the void for the entirety of our lives. 50 A man peeks into the break room to see if there are any free treats there, as there sometimes are. He looks, sees, and goes back into the hallway. “Yogurt-covered raisins,” he says to the woman he’s walking with. I’m just exiting with a cupful of them. “I love them!” I say, surprising the two and making them laugh, “I’m very excited about them. ” I’m in an exceptionally good mood this evening, which should be a good thing, except that suddenly, now that I’m feeling this way, people start telling me how they’re in exceptionally bad moods. Oh, well. 51 I feel nervous about what will happen to this country in both the near- and long-term. I sit and listen to callers to The Washington Journal talk about how, in next Tuesday’s special election in Massachusetts to fill what was Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat, they’ll be voting for the Republican. It seems like the country just goes along with whichever party is the most brashly indignant at the time. If we never learn to take care of our own it’ll be because we’re the Johnny Cash of countries, drunk and sincere, soulful and mad, selfish and sentimental. 52 It was last week, I think, that an arrest was made in connection to all those fires that were set in Northampton. As I suspected, it was a local in his late twenties. I didn’t recognize his name or picture, although apparently he was a regular in the local bars and had last been seen at karaoke at the WWII on the night in question. 53 Salma was, last I heard, due to fly back here from Istanbul in early February, either to visit or to move back. But as of recently she still did not have a flight booked, nor did anyone know of any arrangements she might have made for a place to stay in the area. So, I’m not letting myself get excited to see my friend again until I hear that she has a plane ticket in her hand. 54 Admittedly, I keep wavering between two or three different possible new life plans. But these plans are at least identical at the outset. And everything I’m thinking of pursuing is at least feasible and incremental in nature and pretty much doesn’t count on the economy ever recovering or on me having any especially lucky breaks. 55 I don’t know much about my family or their history. On my mother’s side, talking in any depth about the past is something that just doesn’t seem to happen, at least when I’m around. Meanwhile, I’m basically estranged from my father’s side. So I’ve always felt a bit like I have little knowledge about I came from or who my family is… even though they’ve always been around. I think about the night just before this past Christmas when I took a drive up to Greenfield and visited my aunt and uncle’s store, the large building that has their last name in giant, decades-old letters on the town’s Main Street. This used to be a busy clothing store on two floors; and at the time, my aunt and uncle owned a modest home with a large backyard. Then this became a store on one floor that did little business and rented out some of its space to other businesses, while my aunt and uncle renovated the upstairs and moved in there, while my cousins, their sons, grew into teenagers and then adults. Now this store is a building that can’t sell and a downstairs video arcade that sometimes the local kids go to. And while my uncle stays and watches the arcade, my aunt works for a paycheck at the department store across the street… and even that store across the street is quite empty, these days. And my uncle, Dave, was, on that night when I went up there, behind the counter, and I greeted him, and we chatted. He asked me about how things were going, and I said this and that. And he did begin, that night, and without really any provocation, to talk about his life. He talked about, years before, he and my aunt (my aunt, who is my blood relation), how they considered, briefly, purchasing a building that housed a liquor store plus a space above that they could have lived in, how the price on it had been sixty thousand dollars back then and now would probably be valued at a half million. (“Yeah, sixty thousand dollars nowadays would probably buy you a taco stand,” I comment. ) But he isn’t complaining, as he talks; he can wonder “what if”, but he sounds like he’s just reflecting, mostly satisfied, on where he’s been, and offering, in some way, advice to my unsettled, twenty-eight-year-old self. “I planned it all,” he said—sincerely, if a bit vexingly—”From when I was young, I planned it out. I knew what steps I would need to take, and I did them, one by one. ” This is up north, closer to the small-town setting where my mother and her siblings were raised, and where my mother and father first met on a double-date. The other couple on that double-date was my mother’s sister, Renee, and her boyfriend, my father’s acquaintance, who fathered but did not end up parenting my cousin, Amy, who is five months younger than I. And back in the present tense, as Thursday, Jan. 21 has given way to Friday, Jan. 22, I feel guilty for all that my mother has been doing to accommodate me. But now I’m wondering: did she, in the distant past, herself feel guilty for my childhood with my father and how it confused and unsettled me? Might it have been the sort of guilt that paralyzes you, saps you of your confidence, and makes you unable even to begin to make things right, even if you want nothing more than to do so? My mother would not have an answer to any such questions. To ask would be cruelty: the questions would mean entirely different things to her. They would be attacks in a language that is not hers. And my father? Well. My father made his own latest choice, a year or two ago, about what to do with his life: he chose to go for a Ph. D. , entering the program at the age of fifty-four, instead of retiring into a monastery for the rest of his life, with was the other option he had seriously considered and researched. 56 “What course are you reading that book for?” asks the young woman who has sat down next to the table where I’ve been sitting. My answer is probably not of much interest to her, I gather, since it’s at a college that is about a seventy-five minute drive away. She kind of just nods and says, “Well, have fun. That Coetzee’s always good for a laugh. ” 57 I head to the Sierra Grille, where Jonny is assembling people in celebration of his own thirtieth birthday. I spend most of my time there talking with Jim and his wife. Jonny, to his discredit, does not talk to me much, and on at least one occasion, when he does talk to me, he insults me while introducing me to one or another of his friends who, because he is active as a musician, is far more important than I. Whatever, Jonny. It’s true that I thought that I was cooler than you when we were younger, and I know you have some reason to enjoy feeling, now, like the tables are turned. But unlike you, I never pursued ‘coolness’ as an end, and I certainly never valued it more than I valued people. I’ve had to reluctantly come to accept that I could never count on you as a friend unless you thought my friendship would help you become a rock star. "

We get in good conversation—the sort of quality, reflective talk that is more difficult to find when a crowd of other people is around—and we do not have any major trouble finding the garage by the T stop. I still haven’t told her what we’re doing. We exit from the green line train at Brookline Village, kill some time at a Dunkin’ Donuts, then head up the old school where the American Repertory Theatre production, Sleep No More, is taking place. 59 I would write about the experience of this play, which was excellent… but it’s difficult for me to summon the enthusiasm right now. I am again feeling down, down, down. 60 And somehow, the first few days of the next week pass by. I go to classes. I think about applying to more jobs, but I’ve already been through the screening interview for a position as a Developmental Service Worker (assisting residents with developmental disabilities in group homes, for the commonwealth of Massachusetts) and I’m sort of waiting on that, because that would both be relevant to what I’m looking to apply myself to in the future (which, this week at least, is occupational therapy) and be better-paying than any other position that I would be likely to find. ($13. 60 per hour, or something like that, if you include a second or third shift differential). I spend most of Wednesday and Thursday the way I’ve spent the early parts of Monday and Tuesday—staring into space, sometimes with a computer in front of me—still still still trying trying although I think I may have given up holy shit I don’t want to give up I don’t want to be here help help help please don’t leave me here please still I want to not be here let me be where I thrive and where I do not hate myself and where I improve myself and where the people around me have hope and can support the ‘me’ that I want to think of myself as. 61 I am today wearing a tie over a light blue collared shirt under a long black wool coat. After about sixteen months of growing my hair out, today marks the day when I finally have found that my wild, thick, wavy hair is long enough to tie back; and so, tied back it is. I have on my small, professorial prescription eyeglasses. I am carrying three copies of my resume. I forgot to bring a pen. I quickly downed a small veggie sandwich from Subway before coming here, but that wasn’t enough to really fill me up. I am wearing a 14 mg nicotine patch on my left thigh. The one-on-one interview for this call center position (for TD Bank) takes about an hour. It is conducted by a supervisor, a white man who has gray in his well-trimmed beard. I remember to ask him unconventional but relevant questions. He walks me down, then, to the room where a group information session thingie is about to begin. And I sit and listen to the spiel. And I’m told that I should expect a call either later in the day or early the next morning with the specifics of the job offer, wages and all that. Then I drive to a restaurant that I don’t usually go to. It isn’t crowded. I order a glass of water along with a plate of fish and chips. The meal really, as they say, hits the spot. I’ve removed my tie and unbuttoned the top button of my shirt. I might be able to start the training for this job on Monday; that would be helpful, although I was waiting to hear back from an entirely different type of job, one that I would prefer to accept. I could be better with my money. We all could. No reason for me to be paying this, whatever, probably ten dollars for this food, when I’m just sitting by myself. I think back to the times in my life when I just wanted a job offer like this one—when I was ready to take any job with a wage like this and stick with it and use it to begin my adult life. Oh, how things have changed. I have explored and absorbed. I am encumbered by debt. I am well-educated and knowledgeable. I live under my mother’s roof. I want to hang out with a friend, excitedly. I want friends and a community. I have ambition. So many factors. Once the nighttime comes around, I remember that I forgot my credit card at a bar two or three weeks back. I know that there is no cover on Tuesdays. It’s the open mic. I may as well go. And as an odd assortment of characters plays on the stage to a smaller-than-average crowd—(it has been snowing, and the roads are less than perfect for driving)—I wait for the bartender to come back from the office as he retrieves my card. I tip him well in cash for the single glass of wine that I purchase. And on the third floor balcony, outside, many hours after taking off my nicotine patch, I smoke a cigarette. No one else is outside with me. Leaving the bar, I wonder what that missing ingredient is—the something that my body is lacking, the thing that I would feel better, in the moment, if I could have it. It isn’t sugar; it isn’t water, or caffeine, or even affection. Exercise? That might be it: I was taking long nightly walks before the winter set in. But I’m also, to some extent, missing an identity. All the wonderful people who’ve believed in me over the years, and now I’m back to feeling like a stranger in the world. 62 I try to repress my memories of the one-day corporate training/rallying at TD Bank. On day one I already sort of resent the company I work for. Hopefully the job itself will be better. In other news, I gave a call to the Massachusetts Association for Occupational Therapy, asking for suggestions of how to shadow or volunteer with an OT in the area. I was told that if I sent an email with what I was looking for and some contact information the message would be passed along for me. I’ve received a couple of email responses so far. 63 I made some phone calls, left some messages. Spoke with someone who coordinates hospice volunteers, who said that they would especially like more males… but with my schedule, I wouldn’t be able to make the training classes for it. I went to drop the class that my work schedule interferes with. Drove to Northampton, knowing that I was hungry. Wanted fish. (When I was very young—something like eight years old—I decided that I didn’t like fish, and I didn’t try any kind of fish for almost twenty years. But now that I’ve given it another shot and developed a taste for it. ) I got a table for one at a restaurant, sat with a copy of Dubliners and ate a fish sandwich with french fries. The fish was pretty skimpy, but it was a good meal still. These are the simple pleasures that help me relax, so I was in a pretty good mood when Alice yelled my name and waved me over to where she was sitting with her girlfriend on a bench. I had bought a pack of candy (which I rarely ever do) and the first thing I did was offer to share it, just before noticing that Alice no longer had any teeth. She had had all of them pulled; she said that she was waiting to get dentures. She explained that the state’s health plan for the poor wasn’t going to cover dental expenses after this summer, but that for now she was excited that she would be getting dentures for free. (Alice is younger than I am. ) 64 Mar. 18, 2010. Hartford, Connecticut. At the Starbucks. Waiting for Esther to get into town. (She’s just getting off work. ) It was the second-to-last day in what’s called “nesting” at my job. It’s just taking calls, basically—the same work that I’ll be doing once I’m out on the floor—but on a daytime schedule, with the group that I’ve been trained with, and with a couple of trainer-type people there to answer our questions. Every day at the end of our scheduled six and a half hours we have the option to stay for an extra hour and a half. I didn’t stay today—I wasn’t in the mood—so at 3:30 I sat down in my car and made a few phone calls to here and there about this and that. I had another hospice organization agree to send me a packet of information about volunteering. I’m using the patch again today. Re: work, I’ve been surprised to find that I do not regularly find myself disgusted at the policies that I need to explain to customers. As far as personal banking goes, the services are pretty straightforward and more or less reasonable. Oh! I just got a text message. Esther’s home. I’m gonna head over there, now. 65 My novel-in-progress, I am a Jelly Doughnut, got listed as a finalist/honorable mention by a writing contest I submitted to… but their web site appears at the moment to have disappeared. 66 My birthday begins with a phone call. In typical Levi fashion I am trying to feign awakeness but am probably not succeeding. The woman on the phone is saying that there is another position open with the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services, another strictly third shift position at a group home for adults with developmental disabilities in Amherst. Did I even tell you, Reader, about that meeting? About how I walked through two of the homes, met with a couple of the employees, shook the hand of one frail, bed-ridden, elderly resident, but found out the next day that I was not going to be selected for the position due to my lack of experience? Maybe I did tell you about that, Reader. It was the same day I went to the dentist and had plaque removed from my teeth. Do you remember that? Or was I too lost in my stressed out, sad, living for the future sort of present life to even write those details down? In any case, it was really good, really exciting news to wake up to. They’re going to “recommend me for hire”, which basically means getting hired contingent upon the results of a physical, background check, reference check, and drug test. I get all the details on this after I find my way to the HR office, which is either in Palmer or Monson—one of those towns—to fill out paperwork. I’m excited because getting this job lines up well with my plans for the future, and it gets me the hell out of call center work, and being third shift it will probably give me some downtime during my shifts. So in the morning, then, on my birthday, the air is not especially hot but it’s humid, and then as the day progresses it occasionally begins raining in large, scattered droplets, and then it downpours for a bit, and because this job thing made me feel, at the beginning of the day, that this might just be the best (as they say) birthday ever, I am forgetting that not only did I have no one to spend time with as it hit midnight last night—(shouldn’t I have been out with someone who would buy me a birthday drink at midnight, or something?)—but now it is my actual birthday and the hours are passing, and it’s like, Aw, crap, I’m going to spend the rest of my birthday without human interaction, aren’t I? Alix called while I was in the shower, and she didn’t leave a message, and she hasn’t responded to my voice mail. It’s getting to be night. My mother has gone out somewhere with one of her sisters. I’m sitting around alone. Jill J. (I’ve recently learned) isn’t actually with that guy in Pennsylvania anymore, and I think the word is that she has kind of been down, lately. (Alix has moved out of her apartment and into another apartment in the same house. ) So, in a search for someone to have a drink with, I send Jill a text message… and she seems at first to be interested in doing something, but then she’s realizing that it’s getting late, and so on, so she just says, But I’ll see you tomorrow, I’ll be there at the Deuce. 67 After sleeping and waking up late I go to the Holyoke Mall. I get fish and chips at the Ninety-Nine Restaurant, then go shoe shopping. I dress up, tie and all, for the night out, which Teacher Jen has continued to insist will be a birthday celebration for both her and me, since we share the same birthday. And no one goes, except Teacher Jen and Harry and Jill J. and a couple of Jen’s friends (who don’t stick around for long). And Harry is in a bad mood. The usual DJ, Chris, isn’t hosting this week, so it’s Matty instead, and Matty seems to bring with him a different and less fun sort of crowd, the sort of crowd that is usually there on Saturdays. Harry leaves before long, wanting to sing karaoke somewhere else. Things pick up a bit among our party after Jill arrives. Some other woman is there for a bit, too; I keep forgetting who knows her and from where, but she’s cool. As 2 AM approaches, Jen and Jill and I head out. Jen leaves first, and the it’s just me and Jill chatting, leaning against the rails of the ramp to the parking lot. Some guy hears that it’s my birthday and offers me a choice of beers from his car’s trunk. I don’t open the beer, but hold onto it, then walk with Jill back to her car (which she’s been eager to get back to, owing to her hunger and the half slice of pizza that she’s left in there). So then it’s me and her sitting in her car. It ends up, actually, that the two of us talk a lot about Alix and Flip; they’re on her mind. She has some mixed feelings about Flip, it seems like, and there have been some living space issues persisting even now that Alix does not actually live in Jill’s apartment anymore. We’re talking in that car for a while, then. The lights of the World War II Club get turned off. Yeah, it’s definitely getting to be time to catch some sleep. She has suggested that we hang out in Northampton center the next day, since she thinks there’s something going on around there, in Pulaski Park. She seems not to be really too sure about the details. The next day, Saturday, I wake up earlier than I would have expected, and I drive myself up to Northampton with a blank book to write in, ready to kill some time until Jill is ready to head up. Once I text her, though, she’s saying that she looked into it and Oh, the thing that’s going on is actually taking place on Sunday, and so, if it will actually be tomorrow that she’ll be going to do that, she needs to re-arrange her schedule and get some things done today. So how about tomorrow? Okay, I say. We can meet up tomorrow. So I drive to Vermont. 68 Bennington, Vermont. The South Street Café. I already have paid for my room at a motel, already reacted politely to the interest that the woman (one half of what is apparently a husband-and-wife proprietorship) behind the desk at the office seemed to have in my Smashing Pumpkins tee shirt. I’ve also tried to make use of an IDE-to-USB connector that I got: I hooked up an old hard drive from one of my old computers and tried to find out what was on it, although I didn’t have success. (“The disk is corrupted and unreadable. ”) Nothing left to do, now, I guess, except to sit around and watch the sky go slowly dark (on this, which has been a warm late-April day, my father’s fifty-sixth birthday), and to write in crazy-man penmanship until this coffee place closes. 69 It’s a very typical thing for me to do, a trip to a town that I’ve never been to before that I spend doing things I could have done without traveling at all. 70 I drive east to Brattleboro—a nice drive—then catch I-91 South to Northampton. (When I relate this to my mother, she jokes, “Did you find my cabin?” “I did think of that,” I said. This is true: driving through, I did think of my mother, and how she said to me, a few years back, “You do what you want with your life; just make sure I can get a little cabin in the woods in New Hampshire or Vermont and I’ll be happy. ” Because my mother is a quiet person who very rarely expresses want, I’ve remembered this well, and she has continued to remind me of it. ) I meet up with Jill J. We sit out in back of Haymarket for a bit, talking about her work with kids who have behavioral difficulties. Then to Pulaski Park, where, hey, neat, it’s the Primate Fiasco playing. Good ol’ Dave Russo; I remember him carrying that banjo around ten years ago and me laughing about it. He was the Dylan-loving acoustic guitar guy! Why was he carrying around a banjo instead? Now he’s playing psychadelic Dixieland jam band music all over the place. Good for him. The band’s a unique delight. And there in the park is Anna E. , the famous vulture-laugher of the HCC Drama Club! I saw her briefly, oh, a couple of years ago, not having seen her for even longer before that. She still doesn’t seem to have changed a bit, lovely person that she always was. And so what do I do? I am exceedingly (for no reason except that I have not been comfortable with where I am in life since returning to Massachusetts) awkward, freezing up, not letting myself be present. It’s true: I’ve become afraid of people I know from the past, unless I have had it proven to me recently that interacting with them will not hurt me emotionally. Yes: around new people, I’m fine. Around people I knew in my younger days, I instinctively brace myself for them to now be complete assholes to me for no apparent reason. 71 I texted Marie on my birthday and found out that she now works for the same bank that I’ve been working for. She’s a branch manager in the Worcester area. She calls me on Wednesday and we have a brief conversation and she suggests that I drive out there at some point next week. I say yes, yes, that would be swell. She sends driving directions to my work email. 72 Esther takes me to a gathering at Megan and Chris’s place in suburban Manchester, Connecticut. Esther has commented at how unfair it is that social workers are paid so little, and that may be true, but also, look at this house! It’s new-looking, very much the home of a young, professional couple. Porch and yard and a view of hills in the distance. It shouldn’t be staggering: suburban Connecticut is all it is. But all I think about is money, lately. I mean, I owe a bunch of it, I’m trying to save a bunch of it for grad school, and I work in a fucking banking call center, looking at the details of the accounts of all sorts of people of all ages. The poor young, the rich young, the poor old, the rich old. The gathering is fine. There’s a fire outside. Esther brought a cake. I hate to say it, but I’ll tell you, Reader: I kind of couldn’t handle the frosting. It tasted like I was eating a stick of butter with a fork. But that’s not to insult Esther. It’s all right. They can’t all be triumphs, even if you’re an experienced home cooking type. 73 Then there’s Limbofest, at the Pines Theater in Look Park in Northampton. Jill J. suggested that we go, and although it’s $20, I said yes. It’s a fun day in the park. Family-friendly and full of hippies. Jill gets henna on her foot, and I wander away into the park at dusk to smoke a cigarette and say hello to the frogs. (One of the more peaceful half hours that I’ve allowed myself in recent memory. ) 74 In a dream that I have while sleeping on my bed in my mother’s house in Chicopee, Massachusetts, I drive to an apartment where Arden is living… I go to her door but realize, somehow, that she has company over. I opt to leave a note for her. I walk outside, then, ready to leave, but change my mind and head back inside. When I get back to Arden’s door she is standing in the hallway in a bathrobe, picking up the note that I’ve left. Clearly she did not intend to welcome me here, but she had heard me and was interested to know why I had come. The two of us exchange a few words, but what I get from her expression and tone is that this will only be a conversation that lasts for a few seconds. I am willing to cooperate with what she clearly wants by politely saying hi and then leaving. As we play out this brief verbal exchange, I see in my peripheral vision that there is a woman inside the apartment behind her. Still, I intentionally do not look, because I don’t want to put Arden in the position of having to introduce me. But then there is another woman, too, and this woman walks up to Arden in the hallway, puts her arm around her side, says something to her, and acknowledges me. I see that this woman (who, I can tell by Arden’s reaction, is not Arden’s girlfriend, but is nevertheless an intimate) is dressed in some odd fashion that leaves her breasts exposed. I see now, as well, that the woman who is standing inside (who I have decided is Arden’s girlfriend) is dressed similarly. The politeness that was only moments ago about to lead me out the door now leads me to chat cooly with this bold, oddly-undressed woman. The interaction between Arden and me has been hijacked, it seems. Arden’s girlfriend is speaking, now, and the women are all speaking to each other, and before I know it, they are straying back into the apartment, and I am entering, too. As I walk inside, I see that two men are playing sexually with each other on the couch. These men gradually settle themselves down upon seeing that I am walking in. I speak a little bit with everyone who is present. I sit on the couch. Arden sits down next to me but is distracted. Everyone is talking with everyone else. One of the men says something to Arden, and she says something to him. He scolds her, raising a hand as if threatening to slap her. Arden acquiesces to this, as if doing so were natural. Seeing this shocks me. It has never occurred to me to even imagine Arden reacting that way to someone. I snap at the man who did that to her. In his face I demand, “How dare you make like you’re going to hit a woman!” At that moment, words become important again. I yell at him and he listens. I am surprised by my own words. “Hit a woman”? It is as if I have instantly, without meaning to, jumped into a gendered protective role for what feels like the first time in my life. He is surprised and confused by my outburst, and so am I. But he respects me, then. As I finish loudly making my point, the tension settles down. He and I share a shaky, nervous post-confrontation laugh, and he sits back down on the couch. He does not and did not mean to harm. He would not hit anyone, male or female. But my reaction was understandable. The dream ends. I stir in bed. "

    "title": "XVIII. The Five Year Plan (75-81)",
    "body": "75 Am I really doing this? But I am. I’m buying a phone that will let me comfortably access web content and email. It’s a gadget, and it’s a data plan to pay for each month, but it will serve my lifestyle well. At the first store I go to I wear a disinterested expression while the salesman talks about one phone, points me to a more expensive one, et cetera, et cetera. I finally get him to let me browse unsupervised, but once I’ve spent more than sixty seconds playing with a specific phone he returns and asks, “Would you like to talk about this one?” “No,” I say, shaking my head and refusing to face him. I don’t like to be rude, but he has about thirty seconds left until I become officially annoyed and decide that I’ll buy my phone somewhere else. If I can get the point across that I hate having things sold to me, he might still get the commission that I assume he gets on these things. So really, it’s in both of our interests for me to communicate to him unequivocally that I don’t want him to bother me. But ah, salespeople are salespeople. And he talks to me about the phone when I have specifically turned down his offer to do so. And my money goes elsewhere. (At least, though—unlike the last time someone tried their phone-selling tactics on me—I didn’t have to turn my back and walk away while the guy was mid-sentence. ) I think I’ll forever be the anti-consumer. So, yes, it’s at a different store that I make my purchase on this lovely Monday afternoon (May 3) just before class. I get a Palm Pixi, which is free with my contract renewal and is probably what I would choose with an unlimited budget, anyway, because it feels good in my hand and provides the best flick-the-touch-screen-then-use-the-keyboard-to-type-a-bunch-quickly sort of experience. I have no need for a large screen or whatever. I just want my Internet to be with me always. Then there’s Human Development class. It’s the second-to-last of the semester. Well, that zoomed by. I haven’t really mentioned the courses I’ve been taking, but ah well. Then it is my first time ever driving somewhere with the aid of a phone’s GPS. It works out okay. I get to Marie’s home in Southbridge, which is very close to the center of town but nevertheless feels isolated, sitting as it does at the end of a street, with a backyard that turns into woods. It’s a very large house. I guess that’s just what some people do, huh? Make sure they get a really big house, then do all they can to hold onto it. They stay inside and raise their kids. “This is like walking through my grandparents’ house,” I tell her. With the cellar that leads to the outside, the cellar with that old, familiar smell. The big yard, and the odd wallpaper. Eric D. , her husband, the stay-at-home dad, is either sleeping or hiding away; I don’t see him. At Marie’s request he has brought up firewood so that when I come over it can be Marie and me chit-chatting in front of the little fire pit, made out of cinder blocks, that is there in the backyard. “Where did you guys get the cinder blocks?” I ask. “I don’t know. They were just here somewhere. ” “I think that’s the only way to get cinder blocks. You just find them somewhere. ” Since we’re both at TD Bank, Marie and I talk shop a lot. I’m at a point in my life where I love to talk about finances and other boring, adult things—(though I suspect the novelty of this will wear off before long)—and I eat up the tale of how she got her mortgage and how, since she still has credit card debt, her dream would be to take out an equity line of credit so that she could pay off the credit card debt late at a lower rate, then get that equity line of credit switched into a loan… We don’t get around to talking about me, really, but I know that this is mostly because when she asked me about what life has been like for Levi is recent times, I just said something evasive. Other conversational topics include how she and Eric have found themselves more and more, politically, like (“And this will sound bad, but…”) Constitutionalists, and how in particular Eric’s political views have been growing conspiratorial and anti-government to the extent that it can be, y’know, a little awkward in social situations, the things that he’ll sometimes say… 76 May 5, 2010. The day of my pre-employment physical for the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services (DDS). Everything is unremarkable, except for the part where a physical therapist tests me for the physical requirements of the position by making me lift weights repeatedly—a task that leaves me unable to use my arms properly for the next three days. On Friday morning I drive to my dentist’s office in Amherst to try to get x-rays in time for my consult with an oral surgeon (also in Amherst). But the office appears to be closed, so I just head over to the oral surgeon’s office. They give a call to try to reach my dentist’s office, and they reach the answering service. The person at the answering service says that they’ll try to contact the dentist’s office, since they’re supposed to be open. A few minutes later a call comes back, and so the guy at the oral surgeon’s office is telling me that if I hurry to the dentist’s office to get my x-rays—which are actually the x-rays that I had taken in Oregon, which I had sent to my dentist before my first appointment there—I might be able to make it back in time to still have my consult. I succeed in this task, and I schedule my extraction. Then I drive back to the clinic in Springfield where I had my pre-employment physical, because they need to do the follow-up part of the TB skin test, where they touch my arm and make sure it’s not reacting to the injection they put there. Success! Then I go to work, which, as always, sucks ass, and then I drive to Hartford, where I mean to do some work for my online class in Medical Terminology (the final for which is due the next day)… but instead I end up snoozing while sitting upright on the couch next to Esther. So I sleep in bed, then, and in the morning I wake up with the intention of finishing that online course before Esther and I go to New York City, but CRAP! While loading up my car the previous morning I forgot to bring my Medical Terminology textbook. “I guess I can’t go to New York, after all,” I say, but Esther says that she’ll drive me up to Chicopee to pick up my book and then we’ll speed down to New Haven to catch the train. It’s a rainy day, and I squeal and fear death while Esther drives at high speeds closely behind other vehicles. (I am not an especially nervous passenger, but when Esther is driving, it’s like, wow. ) And then we’re getting off the highway at New Haven and she’s saying, “We can run,” and so we’re running from the parking lot to the train station, and we make the train, and once we’re aboard the train I urinate in the little shaking restroom—(the sort that gives new meaning to the term, “water closet”)—and then I remember that my phone has some tethering capability that I’m supposedly able to use to some extent without being charged for it, and so I use my phone as a wireless hotspot and on my netbook finish my assignments and complete that Medical Terminology course. This is a good thing, because now in New York I can be freeeee! And Esther and I walk around the East Village, and Cliff and his girlfriend show up, and we eat at some place down an alley off Bowery. Then we walk and get some drinks somewhere, then we see the documentary film Babies, then we discuss which was the most awesome baby in the film, and then we go to the place where we went for cheap drinks the last time Esther and I went down to New York. Then Esther and I take the long train ride back, which leads to the long car ride back, and then we sleep, and then I wake up and drive to work, and work sucks ass again, and then I get home and it’s Mother’s Day and my mother is with Bruce at the campground they spend their weekends at during the nice months, and so I just take the opportunity to do some cleaning, and in the morning I wake up to a phone call from the DDS telling me that I can start in two weeks. This start date means that I will need to reschedule my appointment for the wisdom tooth extraction, so I reschedule that. My rescheduling the extraction means that I won’t be able to give a full two weeks’ notice at TD Bank, but I’m not under any technical obligation to give two weeks’ notice, anyway, and since my dental insurance will only be valid until the end of this month I’m willing to give short notice for the sake of having at least several hundreds of dollars of this expensive procedure covered. Then I make some other boring phone calls and I stuff pipe tobacco into the little cigarette tube filler thingie again and again until I have eighteen cigarettes that are, compared to the cost of an actual pack of cigarettes that one would buy at a store, basically free—(this being a recent money-saving habit of mine)—and then I shower and shave and rush off to take my Human Development final. Twenty minutes before the scheduled end of the test it’s only me and one other student in the class, and the instructor is feeling unwell, so he says, “Eh, you both have been excellent students. Just turn in what you have and I’ll give you credit for the rest. ” Then I go to Northampton and get a coffee in Haymarket, and the day is May 10, 2010, and I am twenty-nine years old. And someone stops at my table while I write and I look up and I see that this person is Alice. I smile and hug my old friend. “Did you just come to take in the last five minutes before Haymarket closes?” I ask. “Are they giving away the rest of the pastries?” she asks. I confess that I don’t know, that I haven’t been paying attention… but it turns out that they are, and she leaves with a little brown baggie full of them. I walk away from Haymarket with visions of a comfortable middle class existence dancing in my head. Some kid makes some comment about the Johnny Cash tee shirt that I’m wearing. Then I go back to my mother’s house. 77 Alix calls me after having disappeared for several weeks. It quickly becomes apparent that she’s calling because she has had a falling out with Jill J. and wants to tell her side of the story… to make sure, I guess, that I’m on her side. I handle this in the way that I’ve usually dealt with this sort of call, by sounding neutral and not expressing interest in the details. I know that Alix would prefer it if I were the sort of person who turned against anyone one of my longtime friends turned against… but, honestly, if I were that sort of person, then I would have turned against her by now. No, no. I’ll just keep on liking more or less everyone and hoping that my amiable albeit gauche manner of maintaining connections keeps some people wanting to occasionally get together with me for a cup of coffee. And when I hang out with Jill again I’ve all but forgotten about the call from Alix, although Jill then tells her side and basically says that she’s glad to see I’m not, like, refusing to hang out with her now. I say of their falling out, “Yeah, I’m not a part of this. ” My schedule for the following week now looks like this. Tomorrow, Sunday, May 16, I will (probably) spend the night in Connecticut with Esther. Monday, I will meet up with my father for our (it seems now) quinquennial day of catching up. Yes, I think it was 2005 when that last happened. I believe we shall look at used books in one of the few remaining used book stores that the Internet has not put out of business… then we shall away to visit his mother, my grandmother. Tuesday through Thursday, I will work. Friday, I will get my wisdom teeth out. Saturday, I will lie around and whine. Sunday, I will feel like I am never going to recover, and I will think to myself that I was crazy to schedule my extraction on Friday when I start a new job on Monday. On Monday, I will start my new job, but it will all be introductory, anyway—there won’t be actual work that anyone will be counting on me to do—and hopefully I will gain some sympathy points from co-workers as they make their first judgments on me… since it is, I think, more difficult to really dislike someone you’ve only met when they’re recovering from minor surgery. 78 On Sunday, work is offering the chance for us to leave early. I take that option and don’t regret it, since, just before I leave, that old tooth pain comes back. Let me tell you: getting yelled at on the phone while you’re experiencing throbbing pain and trying not to move your jaw? Less than awesome. I head home and remember that I was told by the oral surgeon to give a call if the pain returned. This means that I speak with the on-call, although I’m not really sure what the point is. He says that he could prescribe antibiotics… “I just started antibiotics,” I say. I was prescribed Amoxicillin as a precautionary measure in advance of the extraction. I let Esther know that I won’t be coming over. I lie down and fall asleep. I wake up a couple hours later. The throbbing recurs, although less dramatically, a couple of times over the course of the night. I’m tired, still, and I keep trying to fall back to sleep, but I can’t. After the sun comes up, I go to the dentist for the rest of the root planing and scaling. The work that’s done is all on the side of my jaw opposite from where the pain keeps happening, so, that’s good… although, of the three visits to the dentist’s office that I’ve had within the past six weeks, this is the one that involves the most discomfort. Then I drive to the Hampshire Mall to meet my father. In the moment I’m too tired to really feel one way or the other about seeing him. He’s older now, gray-haired, speaking and acting more like a southerner, with his words soft around the edges. But he’s still himself; I’m disappointed to find that although I had forgotten how it felt to find him intolerable, I find myself immediately in that situation again. But it is different, now, in a way, because as I sit down and he begins talking about what we can eat I see him as a neurotic who is bad with people instead of (as in my younger years) an authoritarian figure who could not be negotiated with (because his logic could only make sense to him). He asks if I want to eat, and I say that yes, I’m hungry. “I have coupons for Subway,” he says. I say that no, I don’t feel like eating Subway. He asks if I’m sure. I say that I’m sure, and that, since we’re in the food court of the mall, I’ll probably just get something somewhere else, like at the pizza place. He says okay, and that he’ll pay. We go up to the Sbarro and I look at the pizza slices. He asks the kid behind the counter, “Do you have any specials?” and the kid says no. Then he asks me if I’m sure I don’t want Subway; I would get more food in a sandwich than if I just got a slice of pizza. I repeat that I don’t feel like eating at Subway. I’m a sort of afraid, now, that it’ll blow his mind if I order two whole slices of pizza when I could just get a sandwich at Subway, so I go for something completely different and get a small side of pasta. As he goes to order his sandwich, he asks me, “What’s in your mug there?” “I had some coffee. I finished it, but maybe I’ll get some more somewhere in a bit. ” “Do you want me ask at Subway if they’ll fill it with tap water?” “No, that’s okay. ” He goes to the counter at Subway, and comes back, and says, “I asked if they’d refill your mug with tap water, and they said they would. ” “No, that’s okay,” I say. “Are you sure? The guy said he’d do it. ” “I’m sure. ” Although I’m hungry, I’ve ordered a small portion. I’m seeing my father as if he’s a stranger, now, and doing so makes me feel like, Wow. This poor guy is messed up. I’m going to tread delicately so that I don’t stress him out. It’s like a person with apparent mental illness coming up to you on the street and showing you a seemingly random thing—a bracelet, or something—and then looking at you in a way that tells you they’re watching your response, and they can read you clearly, and it won’t satisfy them if you simply say, “Oh, wow,” as if they were a child, because what they are looking for is not to be alone with what they see in that bracelet. Yeah. I really am thinking to myself, Cripes. It wasn’t just my memories exaggerating. (Although it never could have been—everyone who knew my father knew what he was like. ) But now it’s clear that that length of time in a parent/child relationship when a parent is really a parent and a child is really a child has passed for us. The window of opportunity has closed, and he can’t make a difference anymore. I am a part of his life that he never figured out and never came around to. He never met me halfway as he would have needed to do to help raise me into adulthood. I had to raise myself, and I did so imperfectly. So there isn’t any more of that feeling of “perhaps”. I’m pretty sure it was still there when I saw him five years ago. I was still open, back then, to the idea that I might receive some mentorship. But now? Nope. When I mention being tired he says, “Do you want to sleep in the car? I have a book with me. If you want to take a nap for an hour in the car, I can sit here and read. ” I say no to this suggestion. But he also says that he’s leaving soon to spend a few weeks in a French immersion program in Quebec. (Ah, so that’s why he’s visiting his son and his mother: it’s a convenient stopon the way to something that interests him. ) So, he’ll be back after that. He suggests that I could just leave now, and go home to sleep, and that we could arrange to visit my grandmother after his return from Canada. When he asks me if I would like to leave, I can’t resist saying yes… because I am having a hard time with this. It’s even less comfortable to deal with him this time, since the little things are making me feel sad—sad for both of us—instead of making me angry. I drive home and sleep. I wake up before midnight and spend the hours of darkness organizing my old writings. 79 I text Esther to say that between my throbbing tooth pain (which in the past twenty-four hours has kept coming back to say hello every six hours or so) and a general malaise (which I blame on my poor sleep the past several days) and an uneasy feeling in my abdomen (which I blame on the antibiotics) and being at work (which, TGIQ—thank goodness I’m quitting) my day is more or less feeling like death. She responds by saying that if I want to be taken care of and catered to, I would be more than welcome to come by after work. I say that I think tomorrow would probably be better for me, if I could take a raincheck… but when she doesn’t respond for a while, and then sends me an unusual rumination about how she sometimes thinks it would be easier to meet people if she smoked cigarettes, I take this as a reminder of how she has lately been feeling lonely and yearning for she-isn’t-quite-sure-what in her life, and so once I’m out of work I call and ask if she would still like company. I head over and find her folding laundry, lie down on her bed and talk with her about her father. Esther and I are two people at lonely places in our lives. I keep trying to win her over as a friend, but I feel stuck in the lover zone… even though I never felt comfortable being a lover to her. 80 I wake up from the general anesthetic feeling fine, although, when I try to speak, it’s all, “Mmph mmph mmgle,” with the gauze stuffed there in both of the corners of the back of my mouth. Finally, those damn wisdom teeth are gone! THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ACCOMPLISHMENT. I’m all sorts of both hungry and thirsty, but I’ve been told to keep the gauze in my mouth for a couple of hours, and so I do. My mother is off to some sort of Friday night fun with family, so she leaves me my prescriptions and I have the run of the place. I eat about a pint of ice cream, but at least it’s “lite” ice cream. I don’t bother taking the Oxycodone, since I haven’t felt any pain. By 10 PM I’m getting bored and feeling fine. There’s no swelling in my face or anything; I can speak clearly and even smile. Television is boring me and I still haven’t touched my pain meds. So, I do what anyone would do: I drive up to the bar for karaoke night, have a glass of whiskey, and watch some people sing some songs. The next night, Saturday, I meet up with Esther. We meet at Friendly’s in Northampton, where I slowly but steadily manage to eat an entire chicken strips dinner and happy ending sundae. Then we walk around. It is remarkable to me that I have gone this long—since Thursday night—without taking in any form of nicotine. Then she’s leaving to make the drive back to Connecticut, and I’m heading back home so that I can spend the night alone typing up things that I wrote in kindergarten. 81 I go in for my first day reporting to the new job. This is the little house, one of the three locations that I will be floating between as I work the third shift. After doing paperwork and asking a bunch of questions I meet the residents and chat with the other employees who are there. "

    "body": "82 “Over the years, I’ve fallen for many, many a salesman’s tricks,” says the woman who is training me tonight. It is hard for her not to buy the things that commercials advertise while she stays awake through the night and watches Glenn Beck. (She also watches the Christian channels. ) I say to her, “I don’t really get tempted by television commercials, somehow. For the most part, I just don’t pay attention to them. ” “That’s good,” she says. “There’s always some new gadget or invention that they’re trying to sell to you. ” “I don’t actually like spending money on things,” I add. “I’m not a person who wants to have a lot of stuff. ” 83 I leave work frowning. That co-worker ended up finally, right around sunrise, asking about my religious beliefs (after she had referenced “the Lord” all night in ways I politely accommodated but otherwise ignored). By then I had listened to repeated anecdotes about her praying for unbelieving family members and that sort of thing. Pretty rude of her, I thought. It’s amazing how the people whose religious beliefs are least distinguishable from simple narcissism are afforded the most deference by society. But so long as the salesmen aren’t complaining, I suppose, that’s how it’ll continue to be. 84 Sunday. I wake up to a phone call from Teacher Jen (who always calls without warning, doesn’t like to text). We’ve planned to meet up tonight. I drive to Northampton, where she and I consume Haymarket coffee while sitting on one of the benches in front of Pulaski Park. Then we go to her new apartment, call to get a pizza delivered, and watch Pan’s Labyrinth. She tells me that she’s still waiting for an opportunity to talk to one of the occupational therapists she occasionally works with, to ask on my behalf about observing sometime. I already have some other leads that I’m following on the observing/volunteering-in-OT front, but nothing in pediatrics. Every type of experience that I can gain will help my applications when I send them out. My academic record tells a long and complicated tale… but since the GPA from my last 60 credit hours is indeed somewhere in the 3. 5+ range, and since I already have a five-year-old 1290 GRE score that I hope to improve upon when I re-take it next month, and since I have, so far, straight ‘A’s in the courses that will count as prerequisites (Intro to Psychology taken many years ago, plus Human Development and Medical Terminology this past semester) and since I have full-time employment now assisting individuals with disabilities, I’m optimistic about the whole getting-into-one-of-the-programs-I-would-like-to-get-into thing, so long as I meet the observation requirements and successfully apply myself when I take Anatomy &amp; Physiology. I also have to gain some confidence when it comes to dealing with the residents at my job… but that will come soon enough. (I’m not in any way intimidated by the demands of what I’m doing, but I’m still very tentative, being new at it all. ) 85 My first day at another of the group homes. We’ll call this one the “big house”, to distinguish it from the “little house” that I was training at last week and from the “apartment”, which I haven’t been to yet. It seems like this will be another night requiring mostly just sitting around… but, surprise! Around 2:30 in the morning or so, as I and the two staff members who are training me have made it about halfway through the movie Invictus (starring Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela), the fire alarm goes off. My first time meeting four of the six residents, then, is as we’re evacuating. So, yeah. That’s wacky. Then the alarm goes off again! Fifteen minutes later. Which is even wackier. 86 “Has anyone asked you yet who you’re related to who got you this job?” my co-worker asks. “No, they haven’t. Should I be expecting that question?” “Well, that was one of the first questions I got when I started working for the state. ” I sort of just nod, and the night continues. Later on, though, the same co-worker then says, “I know who got you this job! Someone just told me. ” “Um. Myself?” “You’re not related to anyone who works for the state? A relative or a friend?” “No. No one at all. ” “My source is wrong, then. I was told that you were related to someone. ” And she gives a name that I don’t recognize. I shrug my shoulders and go back to randomly reading Aristotle. 87 There’s not really much to the help that we give the residents in the morning. It’s looking like this job should be a piece of cake. Some weirdness from co-workers notwithstanding, I already am finding pleasure in interacting with the individuals who are under our care. 88 After my second overnight shift of the week ends I spend about two and a half hours walking the bike path that runs through Amherst and some other of the area towns. It’s nice: I had only walked a few times along short sections of it. It turns out it branches off at and leads to other walking paths. It’s well-shaded by trees, there are nice views, and it’s like spending time in an odd little parallel universe where everyone is bicycling, jogging, walking their dogs. The shoes I’m wearing are not really appropriate for a long walk, but whatever. I’ve been taking a lot of walks since getting my wisdom teeth out and starting this new job. Even when I’ve really wanted to do something else, like write a story or play guitar somewhere, I’ve been forcing myself to engage in physical activity instead. Still, every day I’m reminded that I wouldn’t be happy staying in Massachusetts long-term. And if I’m going to spend the rest of my time before my thirtieth birthday in a place I don’t want to be, I may as well do abso-fucking-lutely everything I can to make sure that when I leave I am exactly the thirty-year-old I would like to be, doing exactly what I want to be doing. 89 June 18. My time has been so incredibly occupied. Yow. The good: -I’m happy with the job. -I begin volunteering with an occupational therapist soon. -The spaces where my wisdom teeth used to be are fixing themselves up well. No real problems or pain there. -Re: the 5-week-long Physics class I’m taking, it is not yet a trainwreck for me. I’m hanging in there. -At the moment, it looks as though—(knock on wood)—the bad things are not throwing off any of my plans. The bad: -I blew the engine on my car. Purchasing a new one and getting it installed is going to cost me approximately all of my money. This was especially worrying at first, because most of the cost of getting my wisdom teeth out has not yet been accounted for—I’m still waiting to hear what my insurances will cover and so on. But judging by what the oral surgeon’s office tells me, even if the bill turns out to be at the high end of what my calculations say it might be, I should have enough time to take in a few paychecks and pull the money together… and pay for my Fall classes, once I have to do that, and then get back to saving and paying off pre-existing debt. (The only casualty, really, is the tooth fillings I was planning to get, which I will need to delay. ) -The aforementioned Physics class is taking up much of my spare time, in part because it is one week’s worth of classes per day, four days per week, and in part because I don’t actually know the math that the class demands, and so I’m needing to pretty much teach myself all of that as it comes up. (I technically should not have been allowed to take the course, but I managed to get into it, somehow. ) 90 The point is not to have to do this forever. 91 I’m pretty responsible and hardworking when I’m awake. It’s when I’m asleep that I get in trouble. It was about three weeks ago, now, that I was supposed to go through my CPR and First Aid training for work. I’m a third shift employee, but training is held during day. As it happened, I set my clock for AM instead of PM. Fifteen minutes after I was due in I called my boss, and he said that I could still make it to one of the two scheduled classes, and that he would arrange for me to make up the other one at a later date. But then my car died on the way, beginning that whole fiasco… so I wasn’t able to do even that. Those training classes were rescheduled for the Monday before last. If you were to look in my planner, my schedule for the surrounding days looked like this: Saturday 11:30 PM - Sunday 7:30 AM: Work Monday 9 AM - 3 PM: Training Monday 5:30 PM - 9:30 PM: Class Monday 11 PM -7 AM: Work In other words, I was going to have to try to wake up around 7 AM on Monday after going to sleep around 9 AM the previous day… then stay awake for 24 hours. I’m actually pretty capable of defying my body’s natural desire for reasonable amounts of sleep. My rule of thumb for myself is that if I’m going to be well-rested, I know I’ll be able to go for twenty-four hours without it being a big problem. Similarly, I can make it through a normal day on three hours of sleep. These are the sorts of sleep gymnastics I’ll do routinely without it really affecting my day: I have a history of not being able to fall asleep when I want to, as well as a history of working jobs that require me to be up at random and inopportune hours, so I’m just used to it. In this case, though, I was a bit worried, because I was booked for twenty-four straight hours’ worth of obligations after, at best, maybe a brief nap. But I thought, all right, if I have to I’ll just skip my Physics class that day and take a nap before my overnight shift… Anyway. I did manage to settle down for a nap before my training that day. I set both my phone and alarm clock (double-checking to make sure they were set correctly)… but then I woke up late with no memory of my turning off both alarms and falling back to sleep. Shiiiiit. Since I’m new, still in my probationary period as an employee, I was almost fired for this. I’ve been present and on time for all of my shifts, and word has it that people are pleased with having me on board… but I caused a lot of headaches by not waking up on those days. My not having those certifications means the shifts that I would be working alone now have to be filled by already-trained staff, so the department needs to pay them overtime hours. After six months there’s a lot more job security, but until then the best I can hope for is not screw up again. And if it were not for my ill-timed failures at waking up, I would simply be doing great. As a result of all this, I’ve signed up for some wake-up call services through a couple of web sites. I’ve also started heading into town absurdly early when I’m scheduled, so that, if my car breaks down, I still won’t be late to a shift. I’ll go to whatever lengths I have to, to try to be sure that nothing stupid gets in the way of my meeting my responsibilities. Speaking of cars breaking down! My car has been doing some funny things since it started getting all hot and humid this week. I drove to Amherst tonight because I was sick of spending all my never-ending homework time alone at home, and I wanted to sit and do it in a coffee shop. As I’m just coming off a six-night work week, I thought I would treat myself. But the coffee shop’s web site had lied, so after the thirty-five-minute drive I had made, the place was closed. When I started up the car to drive home, it was still making the loud, grinding noise that I had noticed it was starting to make when I parked. Using a flashlight, I checked the oil and saw nothing on the dipstick… walked half a mile and back to the nearest open gas station to buy two quarts of oil, put that in, and still saw nothing. With AAA I knew I wouldn’t have to pay for a tow, so I just got it towed back home. The tow guy then took a look at the dipstick and said, “No, it looks like there’s oil… this is past full. ” So, I just didn’t realize how much a wet dipstick would look dry in the dark under a flashlight. No, I hadn’t even bothered to touch it to make sure. But my car is still having problems, judging by the sounds it had been making, and the fact that it sporadically has been refusing to accelerate properly when the air conditioning is on. My Physics class ends tomorrow/today. On Monday I start Anatomy &amp; Physiology I, which I would say I expect to be difficult and time-consuming, except that, compared to Physics, I think it’ll actually a relief. My expected grade in Physics: A or A-. A lot depends on the final and whether the instructor curves our final grades. It could end up a B+. I don’t know. We’ll see. 92 I have an hour until my shift starts. I’m at the Route 9 Diner, because all the coffee shops close at 10. My Physics class is now officially done with. It’s nice to know that I won’t be needing to wrestle with that anymore. My car, well… it did indeed turn out that the trouble had nothing to do with the oil, nothing to do with the engine that was just replaced. It was the air compressor. My mother told the guy at the repair shop (with whom she, Bruce, and my grandparents are on familiar terms) to just go through with the work; she’ll put it on one of her credit cards and I’ll pay her back as I can. I know she shouldn’t be charging up her cards any further, but I had no say in this, and I suppose it’s true that I probably wouldn’t have come up with any better ideas. 93 Driving into South Hadley on my way back from work, I think I see Robyn. I figure that there’s about an eighty percent chance it is not her—these double-takes happen to me a lot—but I’m left with a mind that gently meanders along various memories of this gal, whose “lover” I was once, long ago. And for a moment, I’m struck by the realization that all this time, she has been aging along with me. (Yep, that’s how this “living” thing works. We all age together. ) But anyway. These three days between the end of my Physics class and the start of my Anatomy and Physiology class are leaving me hours!!! of time, which I myself can choose!!! what to do with. Which brings me, this morning (on a nice morning, a Sunday, not yet hot, partly cloudy) to writing in a notebook here at the Thirsty Mind in South Hadley, Massachusetts. 94 My aunt Cheryl is newly engaged to her boyfriend, Sergio. After I get back home from the Thirsty Mind, I’m told that there is to be a bit of a gathering downstairs today. But of course, I have to try to do that whole sleeping thing. Before anyone else has arrived, I go down and say hello to my cousin Amy, who is up from Virginia. I was trying to participate in these family events more since coming back, but doing so has mostly just made me feel sadder. 95 Arden sends me a text. I’m happy to hear from her, hoping that maybe she misses me as a friend or something… but then I find out that she’s just texting to tell me that Ted the cat died. Aw… Ted. That cat was awesome. 96 Aiming at Occupational Therapy programs, to start in the fall of 2011. 97 I’m telling myself that I have to get through this class, Anatomy &amp; Physiology I, with a decent grade. The difference it could make in my life is huge. It’s strange, a new sort of experience, for me to be throwing myself so fully into these courses, but not emerging with perfect grades. In Physics this had to do with the course material—it was just too much information that was too unfamiliar to me, too quickly, that I was trying to absorb. But here, in A+P, it’s more frustrating to be falling short of an A, because the instructor’s inadequate teaching and unforgiving grading is the biggest problem. I spent from Thursday night until this (Monday) afternoon preparing for an exam… four complete nights of literally going through the textbook and memorizing every bit of information that I could isolate, not to mention my quickly writing and recording songs that I could listen to so as to study when I was driving… and if I assume that I’ll be getting the full 15 points for the essay portion (which has yet to be graded) then the result of all this work was an 88 or 89. And every class session, the instructor adds insult to injury by giving us inspirational quotes about how we should relax and stop trying to be perfectionists. If only we all could have the pseudo-spiritual wisdom of an upper middle class white woman with money in the bank! 98 So, Anatomy &amp; Physiology I was hell. As far as the content goes, I had been pretty realistic about what would be involved, but I underestimated how crappy the professor could be. I ended up with a B+, which doesn’t sound bad, but which is pretty disappointing when you’ve been putting in about sixty hours per week of studying. Sigh. But now that’s all over with. I’ve moved on to a couple of online self-paced courses; I’m trying to zip through as much of those as I can before the new semester starts… This Fall will technically have me taking an overwhelming number of credits, but most of that is online. A&amp;P 2 will be the main event, and it’ll be with a professor who is better reputed according to ratemyprofessors. com, not to mention the fact that it’ll be one chapter per week instead of four chapters per week, and not to mention the fact that I’ve already read through and made flash cards for the first two chapters we’ll be covering. Still, though, my life is not without some amount of fear. From the beginning my co-workers in the group homes have talked incessantly about the five month review, which is the point just before a new hire is officially taken on as a union employee (who then becomes very difficult to fire). This leaves me feeling that there is a lot of pressure on me to dot my i’s, cross my t’s, mind my p’s and q’s, and do various other things with letters of the alphabet. My two month review went just fine—I was marked down for the missed daytime training sessions that had been a terrible slip-up, but I was said to be meeting all the other expectations set for me. I haven’t been late, haven’t called out for any of my actual shifts, but this morning at the largest of the three homes I work in, the incoming morning staff was having me go through the showering routine for the new resident, because, I think, one of the people I had gone through that routine with had said that I… didn’t seem comfortable with it? And had said that I seemed standoffish. I know that the problem is how I tend to get awkward when someone tells me to do something in a way that is different from how I learned it: “Oh, put the chair here. ” “Put these clothes on first, then stand him up,” et cetera, et cetera. So, the three things that I will do to try to stop the morning crew at this house from wanting me to be asked to resign are: 1. I will try to be outgoing. Although my reluctance to be aggressively social is based on the fact that this carries its own dangers, my doing this should at least be able to stop anyone who might claim that I’m not working well with the other staff. 2. I will bring in delicious food for everyone to eat. Others do this, and I’m pretty sure it’s a good strategy when you’re being judged and your reliability and basic competence aren’t enough for you to get by on. 3. If someone interrupts me to correct what I’m doing, I’ll say, “No, I do it this way” and do it. It’s clearly time for me to rely on my own strategies. This applies to one of the other houses, as well, in particular with regard to one especially difficult resident there (who likes to wail and scream and lash out when he doesn’t get his way). Although in theory my priority should be to handle him in the way that is best for him, well… that leads me to strategy number 4. … 4. For so long as I am still within my first six months, I will strive, whenever other staff are around, to pretend that my only job is to make their lives easier. The good news is that the staff I think like me so far include a few supervisors… and on the whole, I haven’t been drawing too much negative attention to myself since I started the job. I’m doing extra cleaning tasks around the homes, and I’m documenting these. So, that’s all good… but the one thing I can’t have is the other staff starting to speak ill of me to the bosses. It’s a shame, though: I’ve been trying to wean myself back off of nicotine by using less of the nicotine replacement stuff that I have in my arsenal… but I’m not sure how much I’ll be keeping up with that, now. Anyway. In other news, yay! I have two days off from work in a row! In the past fourteen days I have worked thirteen days, put in more volunteer hours at one hospital and observed at a second one, learned the material for and taken one exam and one lab practical, plus taken the final exam for that class. I also welcomed Salma back from her time spent in Turkey (by going over for dinner and drinks after being awake for twenty-four hours straight, and ultimately sleeping on her couch and going out for breakfast the next morning before staying awake for another straight twenty-four hours. ) Also, I seem to recall that I checked out Alix’s nice new apartment (centrally located on Main Street in Northampton) and had a cola at karaoke night before work on Friday. But, yeah. I just have to keep trying, and hope that things can go well for me. Hope is what we have. We certainly don’t have certainty. 99 To be honest, I thought that I would be fired today. I began my shift with that presumption. I “don’t take initiative” when it comes to direct care?… I knew that was the story I was up against. I had already seen that my schedule had been changed so that after my nights off this week (tonight and tomorrow night) the schedule shows me as being at the big house. And that’s where I was working for this shift that I just finished… and I had been called earlier in the day with a request for me to work overtime for an unspecified number of hours after the usual end of my shift… And Amethyst, the twenty-four-ish-year-old who was hired a week before I was, was fired under similar circumstances—asked to stay for overtime for an unspecified number of hours. And looking ahead in the schedule, I was able to see that for the next couple of weeks, at least, I wasn’t needed anywhere… so it appeared that I could be let go without any immediate changes to the schedule. Suspicious. And I would have been angry, if that had been the way things went. After all, prior to last week, the only feedback I had really been given had been that I was a good worker, impressing people, so on and so forth. And, yeah. I’m someone who doesn’t have the usual weaknesses: I’m not nodding off, I’m actually doing all of the cleaning chores that I’m supposed to do. In the morning, when Mark, who is my boss but not the boss of the house—(the big house has its own person in charge of the house, Susan, but I float between this house and two others and am officially based out of the little house, which is one of Mark’s houses, and Mark was the one who hired me). So, when Mark showed up in the morning, I figured, Yup. I’m gone. But I just went about my business. This was first shift, now, and I was busy doing things I hadn’t done before, like getting Lenny lifted onto the toilet and then getting Ainsley pivoted onto the toilet, and whatever else… oh, yeah, prying Orville’s hands off his grip on his wheelchair and holding him up during a grand mal seizure. Enough to distract me, even from the thought of losing my employment. Mark was supposed to meet with Susan, it turns out, but Susan was for some reason not there. Susan finally came around, as the nurse and the other staff person and I were gathered around one of the kitchen tables and talking about work-related things. She sat me down, and yeah, her message for me was that I should show initiative, show initiative, show initiative. Time will tell whether I regret not seeking out another job now, pre-emptively… but I want this fall to be about acing classes while squeezing in as much volunteering as I can. 100 I introduced Esther to Salma the other day. Salma was in the kitchen when we arrived, and soon Esther was helping in the elaborate preparations. Esther, of course, needed to leave at around 11 PM, having a long drive back to Hartford ahead of her, and needing to work in the morning. (Myself, I was going to have to get up in the morning for my Red Cross testing for the passing of medications… but because I was trying to adjust my sleep schedule in order to be up for it, I was able to say to myself that hanging out with friends and drinking wine was going to help me fall asleep before sunrise and therefore was the responsible thing to do. ) 101 At work, at the apartment, again. Re: the night that I and Esther went over to Salma’s place, it’s worth noting that by some process or other I ended up having a good cuddle-and-sleep with Salma on the mattress that is her bed on the enclosed porch that is her room. And in the morning I prepared for testing at the Red Cross, and I went to that in Springfield, and then I finished out my eight hours for the day at the little house. The Fall semester at STCC begins tomorrow. I’m still not one hundred percent sure about all of the courses I’ll be taking. "

    "title": "XVIII. The Five Year Plan (102-117)",
    "body": "103 I’m going to pause here from my studying for Anatomy and Physiology, because I would like to note that on Wednesday morning, after going in to class early to take a quiz that I missed while in New York, and after then working a shift at the big house, and after then driving to Southbridge and volunteering in the OT room at Harrington Hospital and tagging along upstairs to observe some inpatient treatment with a student from Springfield College who is doing her final placement before she graduates and takes the certification exam for OTs, I was beginning to doze off behind the wheel, on the Massachusetts Turnpike, and so I took exit 8 and drove, scared, because as often in my life as I have driven without sleep I have never really felt that I was in danger of crashing my car because of it, and so I looked for a hotel to stop at, and I kept looking, kept looking, but didn’t find one until I got to Amherst, and at the Amherst Motel I got a room and slept and then woke up, went home to get my cell phone charger and other things, and then I drove back towards Amherst, but Salma was wanting to chat on the phone, and so I was driving and talking on the phone with the phone plugged in to my computer to charge, and as I was talking to her I said to myself, “Aw, heck, I was gonna devote tonight to studying, but no, I can hang out for a bit” and so I met with her at Packards and we had a couple of drinks and ate some food and when I asked where she would like to go next she asked if we could go to my room at the motel and so we did, and at some point I was like, “You’ve said on a few occasions that our cuddling together has made you start to feel nervous around me. Do you want to talk about that?” and so we talked about that, and outside in the parking lot of the Amherst Motel while I had a cigarette she could be held next to me for warmth and she could say, like we all say at these moments, “There’s Orion,” and the tone was set, and somehow, as we drank beers that I had brought with me to the hotel room just in case, it felt to me, even as we very uncertainly talked things over and it was looking more likely that we would have to start trying to draw a line somewhere in terms of our interactions with each other, as if this were one of those moments of the youthful discovery of love, one of those times that you never forget, when the careful and enamored and peaceful passion of a conversation whose touches mean more than its words steps outside of you and onto every other object in the scene, so that you remember the sounds, the sights, of everything around you (romantic or not) in that same domain of tactile-focused restfulness, and oh, oh, it all starts to feel like that word, “Oh,” but really we were not beginning a romance, and really we were adults, and really, the next night, after going to Packards again, we would be talking about future plans, and feelings, and places in life, and complications, and what is important, and we pretty much were coming to say that no, we should pull back, and let’s not sleep next to each other again, but I had to pee, and I went inside the place she’s living now in Easthampton (where once I came over for a party-thing that she had invited me to, a few years back) and then I’m sleeping over, but it’s physically uncomfortable, this time, on her small mattress, and in the morning, at the coffee place there in Easthampton, we sat outside on the grass and smoked cigarettes and talked about when she applied to colleges as a high schooler, and I said, oh, oh, forget how I said it, but I said that we should try to keep things as they always have been, although, oh, the way it felt to sway with you, gentle friend, as we stood hugging each other at 4 AM in your bedroom. 104 I bought an electronic cigarette the other day. It’s cheaply made, and parts of it will probably break a lot, but for as long as it works, it should be nice to have. 105 Cold comes, car windows are frosted in the morning when I leave from my shift. And I say to myself, Oh, please, nonexistent God, don’t let this job slip away from me this autumn. 106 Salma’s birthday went well. She and a few of her friends—friends who were women, of course—had been hot tubbing, and I joined up at Packards, where they were drinking and where I ate. (I always feel left out with things like that, of course. The “you’re not invited because you’re a man” thing. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to it. ) Then to India House, where there were still more people, including Salma’s brother, Haris. And I was comfortable and made well-received witticisms all night. I got pensive listening to the corner of the table that was single women talking about their issues with men. Me having to explain that it wasn’t so strange for me to be in the midst of their brutal woman-talk about dating, since the masculine gender already knows I’m not on their side, not faithful to my inheritance, a traitor, a spy. 107 I skipped out on spending this Halloween weekend at the same party I went to last year with Alix and that crowd. Instead I spent an hour and a half with Esther at Panera Bread, then went and worked an overtime shift. Esther was crying when I met up with her. Her promotion puts her in an impressive place, gives her a raise, but is also kicking her ass. Due to huge amounts of work she had to cancel going to New York for her friend Cliff’s birthday. It was hard to see, her wiping her eyes. She gives each day her all. 108 Nov. 2, 2010. To be realistic, I at least have to entertain the possibility that I will be losing my job this month. If I can keep this job I will be in such good shape money-wise, it looks like. If I don’t, I’ll have to go through all the bother of getting things under control. BUT I think I will still be in good enough shape to start an OT program, either way. 109 Except, I don’t necessarily know about recommendation letters. 110 Will it be today? It feels, it looks like today will be the day. Less than two weeks until the six month mark… forced to stay overtime in the morning here at the big house, and so on, and so forth. I meant to wake up early this morning and print out recommendation forms for my Psychology professor, but instead I slept through and didn’t go. The weekend went by so quickly and left me feeling down on myself. Fighting off a cold… On Friday, Esther picked me up and we went to Portland, Maine. She paid for the best and most expensive dinner I’ve had in my life. Then to some bar she had looked up in advance. To sleep in the hotel, then a breakfast that was really a lunch. I was liking Maine… Arden did respond to my texts, and I told her that I was in Portland… We hadn’t been in touch since she told me that Ted the cat died. Esther and I stopped off in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on the way home. We had some coffee there. Then I was off to Diva’s for the thirtieth birthday celebration of my cousins Chris and Ken. I got in touch with Salma soon after I arrived, which was good, because, oh, I don’t know why my family doesn’t like me. I don’t know why no one likes me. But Salma and I hung out and had a couple of drinks, then a gay man was striking up conversation with me while a lesbian was striking up conversation with her. Apparently, Chris got into a fistfight or something at the afterparty… but I wasn’t invited to the afterparty. Then Salma and I were in the car, and y’know, it’s like I had forgotten that anything had gotten strange at all between the two of us, because I so easily slid right back into, like, Hey, it’s my friend Salma and we’re hangin’ out and that sort of thing. Until she brings it back up and we go to Dunkin’ Donuts to pee and get some coffee or whatever, and it’s the night when the clocks are set back for Daylight Savings Time, and then I’m back at her place, awake for forever when in my brain I’m thinking I should have been doing schoolwork but on the other hand what the hell is the point because nothing ever works out and I’m not going to get out of this area and I’m going to lose my job and I have completely completely failed to even begin my adult life, and I am such an embarrassment to myself, and I would be an embarrassment to others too if others cared about me, but if others had cared about me then shit wouldn’t have been quite so hard for me and my brightness and dedication would have been enough for me to have amounted to something in this world, which I haven’t. So now I’m at work and thinking that this is probably my last night here, and I’ve squandered most of the surplus money I’ve been making on classes that won’t do me a bit of good, and without the dental insurance that keeping this job would get me it’ll be thousands for me to get my mouth in order unless I can find something else, another job, a different job that will provide that. So, if I’m right and I’m not keeping this job, what happens next? Back to JHU? An OT Assistant program? 111 Nov. 10, 2010. Stop the presses. Great fucking news. I’m keeping the job. Phewwwwwwwwww. I found that out yesterday. Midway through the shift, my two bosses—Mark and Susan—snooped around and then snuck inside the house while Lois and I were working. Happily for us, even though it was quarter ‘til four in the morning—a time of night when there usually isn’t much to do and we just sit around—they happened to come in as we both were taking care of some small household tasks. In the morning I had my five month review, which is basically when you get fired if you aren’t going to be kept past the end of the six month probationary period. And they’re keeping me! I think I owe this largely to the fact that Lois at the big house likes working with me, combined with my good attendance. So, yeah. That is under control now. And that is a big thing to have under control. I’m still having to think through what my plans are when it comes to moving. Because I don’t currently have three recommenders—(the problem is always the recommenders)—my list of schools to apply to has been pared down. Pacific University was and is where I really wanted to go, out there in good ol’ PDX-land, but it isn’t an entirely uncompetitive school to get into… There would be financial benefits to going to school around here… but when I think long-term, even borrowing a lot more money through federal loans does not seem to carry as much risk as sticking around here, dedicating another two to three years of myself to delaying the gratification that I would get from being somewhere I would like to be. 112 Salma and I go to the World War II Club. Is it productive, going to the karaoke night at a bar with friends? In some ways, no. But in some ways, yes, spending time in a setting like this facilitates connection and interaction in ways that are more difficult to find otherwise. Stephanie and I get Salma to dance, Stephanie turning out to be a bit of a dirty dancer with her up-and-down and grinding and all that. And as I’m on the dance floor doing my I’m-here-on-the-floor-just-to-dance-with-my-friends-and-yes-my-friends-are-all-ladies-what-of-it thing, it feels the way I remember the World War II Club feeling. After heading back to Alix’s downtown Northampton apartment, Stephanie lies down in the living room to sleep, while Salma and I go to the fire escape and smoke clove cigarettes (no longer legal to sell in the U. S. ) that I randomly came into recently and decided to give her. She says again that she was/is/has been confused by me since she came back from Turkey. We end up inside, then, in the hallway, and finally Alix comes up and says she has to run inside for something, then she’ll sit with us. She returns with an assortment of Flip’s personal sundries and sets them outside the apartment door. Yup, the couple was having a fight, and Alix wanted to remind him that this is her apartment, not his, and that he can’t take for granted that he’ll be coming back to it every night no matter what. He comes up and gets his stuff. He leaves. Inside, whenever Salma rests her head on Alix, cuddles up to her on the bed, holds her, I am reminded of what I want and crave most, which is a friendship that allows for such moments, without such moments having to lead inevitably to either sex or awkwardness. In the talk I had been having with Salma she had said (more than once, even after I told her that it hurt to hear her say it) that she’s not sure if she was just a warm body to me. Whenever she and Alix thoughtlessly and cutely supported each other with hugs, I secretly thought to myself, Well, is &lt;/i&gt;Alix just a warm body to you? You and I have much more of a history, have known each other far longer than you and she have known each other. But it seems that you don’t even understand what I’m saying when I say that what we’ve had for the past decade is the thing that I’m afraid of losing. &lt;/i&gt; We stay up until about five in the morning. After Stephanie I’m the first to go to sleep, borrowing a blanket and sleeping on (but not bothering to fold out) the living room futon. I quietly leave a little before noon. Miraculously, although I parked in a metered lot, I do not see any parking ticket on my windshield. 113 To think about the future is intimidating. There is a slow change happening to America, and changes happening to other nations, too. There are definitely times when I start staring into space, wondering: is there somewhere else I could go outside of America, where I would be in less danger of encountering chaos and desperation over the course of my lifetime? I have to face it—even if I manage to pull off a middle-class financial independence for myself in the next five years, how much in America will be breaking around me? How much has yet to be lost of this country’s comforts that I will, once they are lost, never be able to see here again? As a teenager, I felt as though the downfall of life as we knew it was an idea just somehow floating, prevalent, through the air. It’s an obsession that dates back at least as far as Christianity, right? Did being young during America’s cold war with the Soviet Union have some mostly unconscious effect on me and others my age, leaving us feeling helpless, like the end might really be dropped upon us at any time? I’m not sure. The history books are full of dramatic stories that have long bored Americans. But the time we are living in is tomorrow’s history. Surprises, both good and bad, happen on the large scale, just as they do on the small scale. I don’t know how things are going to be ‘round these parts in five, ten, twenty years, but I shouldn’t pretend that the most likely scenario is things remaining the same. 114 I meet up with Salma and throw money down my throat, trying the macaroni and cheese at the Dirty Truth while drinking. It’s getting to be the time of year when you always have to be inside, even if it’s only inside a car. So, once we’re done at the Dirty Truth, we sit in Salma’s car. I talk about how it looks like I’m doing it, it looks like my ambitious plans are coming to fruition. And we’re inside her car for a while, then we decide to go to Packards, where we can alternately urinate and take in more alcoholic beverages. It’s fun, fun, good times until we’re back in her car. I had forgotten that there is still the awkwardness she is feeling about me and that with the impetus of awkwardness Salma can sink down, down, down. 115 My classes are almost done. 116 I spend about half of my shift at the big house sitting in the office, surfing the web on my phone. What I’m looking at has to do, as it usually does, with “just one more” thought about my plans and OT program applications, “just one more” maybe-possibility that I want to do some more research on. 117 Once I’ve shown Lois the recommendation letters that she was happy to sign her name to, and once she has filled out the forms, and once the envelopes have been sealed, I feel pensive. It’s hard when things are out of your hands. "

    "body": "118 Then it’s one of those mornings when everything sparkles thanks to the cold and moisture. It feels like it has been cold enough to snow for a while, now, but we’ve only seen snow in its small-crystals-flying-through-the-air-and-sticking-to-nothing form, and even that only once or twice. I drive through South Hadley and mail out the recommendation letters Lois signed for me. I keep driving until I get to Amherst. I stop at Bruegger’s, get egg, cheese and sundried tomato on a cinnamon raisin bagel along with—(I forgot this existed)—a chai tea latte. It’s a delicious intake of food for a day that is, actually, feeling rather delicious itself. I can’t believe I’m getting away with this, I think to myself. 119 At Bruegger’s I work on my Sociology final, which is a quick and easy essay prompt. I stop at Jiffy Lube—my car failed inspection before, but now Bruce has fixed things up on it—but apparently, the tail light still is messed up. Oops. So, that isn’t taken care of yet… but whatever. I have all month, I think. To Northampton, where I sit at the Woodstar and finish that Sociology thing. Man, I don’t know. I’m just feeling swell. Drinking jasmine tea. Observing the Northamptonites. I haven’t quite wrapped my head fully around the fact that the semester is over… I’ve changed my mind about the online classes I was going to jump right into after the end of this semester, so all I will have is my self-paced class in Statistics to finish up… then I’ll have two little online classes in the spring. Other than that stuff, I need to finish my applications and maybe get some sleep and socialize and clean my car and clean my living space on occasion. And look for that second job I’ve been thinking about starting. But in any case, wow. I am glad to have made it. 120 There is Christmas shopping. Then there is Julian’s arrival by airplane. I meet him at the airport and drive him to Northampton. He’s excited, talking about how much he appreciates Massachusetts now that he has been living in Indiana. Me, I can’t share in the excitement: this is the area I tried to escape from time and time again. This is my dead end. This is where I look around and see my memories of disappointments. I take him to the Paradise City Tavern and buy him dinner. We catch up, then I drive him to Westfield, where he’ll be staying with Morte. The next day I do OT program application things, then I pick up Julian again and take him with me while I finish Christmas shopping. I wrap presents. Wrapping presents isn’t something I’ve often done. I wrap the couple of small things that I got for Esther and think superstitiously to myself that I hope she won’t stop talking to me, now. I’ve had this fear—this fear that if I get someone presents, they’ll vanish before I get the chance to hand the presents over—since, I think it was, the year 2000, when a good number of the friend-presents I got sat around in my closet while I didn’t hear from people. I take a nap for about an hour before I have to go in to work. Soon, it’s technically Christmas. 121 Christmas is not terrible. I buy presents for my cousins’ kids, and these presents are well-received. There is some difficulty getting email attachments to show up in the wireless network-compatible picture frame that I get Memé and Pepé, but the pictures show up just fine when they’re put on using other methods. 122 After a much-deserved long day’s sleep, I wake up to the early fugues of a blizzard. I call up the big house, where I’m scheduled to work, and say, “I’m extra tonight, so I think I’ll just use a personal day and not come in. ” I’m told, though, that Penha has already called in, so I agree to work (though I still take a half hour of personal time so that I can drive what I think will be a less precarious, though longer, route to Amherst). Early in the shift, Ainsley’s temperature is high. It even seems to be rising, at a scary rate. Her usual midnight meds include some Tylenol, so my hope is that this will help to bring her temperature down. It does, or else the temperature just goes away on its own, I don’t know. In the morning I take advantage of the fact that fewer people than usual are out in the world by making use my gym membership for the first time. I just use the treadmills and exercise bikes. It’s fun! 123 I wake up in a bad mood. Still missing letters from one of my recommenders. (Hurry up, please. ) 124 Julian’s friend dies in Indiana on December 30. 125 On New Year’s Eve it’s Julian, Salma, Jill J. , Stephanie, and I at karaoke at the WWII Club. Julian walks back to where he’s staying in Northampton while the rest of us head to Alix’s apartment. Salma, Jill, and Stephanie are going to go downstairs to Local Burger; I decide to just let myself fall asleep on the mattress on the floor. I’m surprised when, as I’m sleeping, Salma asks to snuggle up with me, sharing the mattress. (There is also a futon, which I had assumed she would be taking. ) In the morning, the first morning of 2011, I’m just hung over enough for it to feel like a New Year’s Day. These holidays have gone nicely for me, all things considered. I’m awake first, so then Salma’s up, then Stephanie and Jill are up. It takes a while before we figure out what we’re doing with ourselves—a very slow morning/afternoon. But finally we head out and go across the street to Kathy’s Diner to eat. 126 Julian gets an earlier plane flight back to Indiana. It feels like Julian is going to be changed by the death of his friend. His walking away from our group, all the way back to an apartment on the other side of town after the turn of the new year, was the last I saw of him on this trip. 127 On January third, twenty-eleven, I meet up with Esther at Panera Bread. I give her the presents I got her for Christmas: a three-disk set of interviews with comedians conducted by National Public Radio’s Terry Gross, plus Lorrie Moore’s book Self-Help. 128 Some rec letters still haven’t arrived, so I call up a different professor, who says that he’ll be glad to help and should be able to get the letters done within a day or two. 129 Originally, the idea I posed to Salma was that we go to the open mic at the Yellow Sofa and see if Alix would want to come down (from, literally, upstairs) for it. But Salma tells me that Alix is so busy, catching up on work things after her two-week-long vacation to meet members of Flip’s family in Florida, she’s not going to be able to hang out for long. After thinking over what we could do that would be new or unusual, I suggest driving to the town of Turners Falls. We go there and get beers at a bar, the Rendezvous. It’s an all right place. Much like I did on New Year’s Eve, I say to Salma, “Thank you for hanging out with me. I was worried that this might not happen anymore. ” And there are a few people at the bar, a couple of groups at tables, and the two of us in a booth. And it’s maybe eleven-thirty or midnight. And the conversation happens in such a way that it can’t be recreated or well-summarized after the fact in the Life Story here… but it’s the type of talk that I wish I could hang on to, wish I could remember. What wisdom might I (if I could have conversations like these documented fully) apply years from now, what insight might I have with hindsight, looking at the words exchanged between Salma and me?… Confused, confused. Again that she was so confused. And that the thought had been that she should go without spending too much time with me, for a while. Her friend Wendy in New Jersey was disappointed to hear that I was not going off into the sunset with Salma (so to speak). And yes, so Salma and I are talking about these things, and after we’re finished with the beer-drinking and the bar is going to be closing we sit in her car. Isn’t it, hasn’t it always been this way with Salma, sitting in cars? It would probably feel childish to me if I were still living outside of this Noho-world, if I hadn’t come back. Sitting in cars? Why? Shouldn’t there be better options? But so often there are not. And a police cruiser drives by a couple of times before stopping to say that we’ll get a ticket if we stay there for too much longer. A ticket for what, I’m not sure, but I don’t ask. We’re in Salma’s car. And maybe I show some more emotion while talking to her this time, and that makes the difference. Maybe it’s because the wound is no longer fresh and I’m being consistent, saying, “I will not date you or have a relationship with you. ” Maybe I just happen to choose the words that will make sense to her as I go over again what my intentions were, what my experience was of that brief period of time during which it seemed she and I might be getting romantic together. And there is, maybe, snow… we are entering that snow-covered part of the Massachusetts year… but anyway, whatever it is that makes the difference, something helps Salma feel much better after our conversation. And she is comfortable with hugging and holding hands with me there in the car, and it’s like she is even thrilled, suddenly, to be my affectionate friend, and she wants me to sleep over, and ALL IS WELL as we cuddle up and sleep in her bed, although the conversing of her roommates in the morning keeps us from really getting a full night’s sleep. We go to the, I think it’s called The Silver Spoon there in Easthampton for breakfast, although what I get is lunch food (and although it’s lunch time by the time we get out of the house. ) Then I’m off, and I do I don’t know what, although it’s wonderfully in my newly clean living space. Clean clean clean clean. My living space is organized and de-cluttered and not disgusting. Now I want to be sure that the same can be said for my life in general: I AM GOING TO GET THIS PLACE CLEAN. 130 Northampton, Massachusetts. I head to Alix’s apartment. I walk in to a dark living room, where Flip is smoking a cigarette and playing the keyboard. Flip, who like me has a predilection for black clothing but who, unlike me, keeps his hair short, neat, clean-cut. At karaoke he will throw Jim Morrison growls into any song he does. And in the kitchen, perhaps getting herself wine, is Stephanie, who is on the short side, and who wears glasses that are so much a part of her look that she, like, can’t recognize herself in the mirror if she isn’t wearing them. And once all of us are in Alix’s room and Stephanie has reconsidered the outer layer of what she will be wearing out tonight she is talking about her glasses and asking if we think that she should in fact keep those glasses, keep wearing them constantly. We all say that the glasses are good on Stephanie, that there’s nothing wrong with them being her “thing”. Alix shows off the web site for the fancy-nice hotel that she will be staying at while in Las Vegas for one of her clients (which might offer her a job, although, she says, she would be unlikely to accept a job from them, because she so much would prefer to see if she could do better by continuing to work for herself. ) And at this time in history, television news is sometimes beginning to say (via its commentators) that the younger generations are needing to look at the world around them with a more entrepreneurial eye than their parents. Jobs just don’t seem to be coming back in any big way. And the Earth continues to spin around the sun. And people continue to murder each other and angle for positions of power and strive naively. And there is no point to life. Flip and Alix kiss regularly, quickish but not negligible kisses. There is snow beginning to fall, on this Friday night. Everyone is ready for a night at the Deuce, but I have to work. “Call out!” says Stephanie, and then I actually begin to consider the option of doing exactly that. And after driving everybody to the World War II, then, I hang out in the parking lot and call the big house (where I’m scheduled to work) and I ask if anyone has called out. They haven’t, so I don’t feel bad about using one of my personal days. And I go inside and order a glass of wine. And I am and am not an exceptional person. There are six billion going on seven billion epic tales transpiring, most of the details unheard. And all that I can assume that I have in common with the other people in this bar—all the touchstones, the contemporary music, the vernacular—will pass by, and we do not, living these lives, imagine ourselves to be making an impact on any grand scale. So we mostly ignore the grand scale of things. We become experts on the townies around us, maybe on some style of fashion, maybe on some television program. And I am twenty-nine, twenty-nine, twenty-nine years old. I am feeling (it is dark in this bar, of course, and it is more crowded than I would have expected on a night when it is snowing) like I can, now, must, now, shall, now, begin to re-assemble the pieces of who I am, and begin to indulge, again, my desires in life. What am I now? Can I still be attractive? Am I funny? Interesting? Do I have any talents that a person I meet might see and find appealing? Why do we love to associate with those we believe to be talented? Love is something. Love is something, and we are all going to die. Love is something. I don’t sing, on this night, but it’s funny and fun how Stephanie is getting more comfortable with me, I think—grabbing me to dance because she knows that I will. And on the dance floor with Alix and Stephanie, they try teaching me to dance more properly. “Look at me like you’re starting a fight with me,” Alix says, while Stephanie prompts me to follow her as she goes down low. Fun and funny. And I keep having at the wine, but I’m not going crazy, not over-drinking. And outside during a smokey-time, there’s a gal Salma and I were talking to on New Year’s Eve. I find out that her name is Kim; upon hearing her say this, I am somehow disappointed… I am apparently not impressed by the name Kim. And then she disappears. And where is Salma? She had something else that she was planning to do tonight. She isn’t responding to anyone’s messages… until, finally, she does respond! And she says that she’s going to try to get here before one o’clock (at which point admission into bars is no longer allowed, per state law). She doesn’t manage to arrive before one, but she does arrive. Alix has already made a point of initiating a conversation with me about Salma. And then, since Salma is outside, I’m sitting with her in her car, in the parking lot, for the last forty-five minutes, until the others leave the bar. Stephanie throws herself across the passenger seat, and therefore me, in giving Salma an energetic hug. Salma and I each drive some folks, and we all head up to Alix’s. Flip goes to his car to get backup reserves of alcohol. I keep drinking along with everyone, since I’m safe and at a problem-free crash spot… but I pretty much stick to wine, which I’m rather sure is wise. Music is played on guitar. And oh, we are being loud. As we’re having a sing-along of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” Alix’s old, disabled neighbor comes knocking. I hear him say, “It’s 3:30. ” And the night goes on, but minus the loud sing-alongs. Salma feels in danger of throwing up; she’s drunk. Alix and Flip are the first to go to bed, and then the rest of us are playing a couple of quick, silly games—some Scrabble-like board game that no one has the cognitive ability to play, plus twenty-one questions. I assure Stephanie that I will watch out for Salma. Salma tosses and turns on the mattress before deciding that throwing up will help. She goes in the bathroom and forces herself. Eventually, around five or five-thirty, we get to sleep… until about 8:30, at which point Salma is saying that she has to move her car to avoid getting towed and that I should, too. I had not even considered the possibility that because of the falling snow my car might be in danger of getting towed. As a matter of fact, a quick Google on my phone seems to suggest that my car has probably already been towed. (I parked in a different lot than Salma did. ) Lo and behold, my car is gone when we stumble outside. But Salma’s car is fine. Salma is not safe to drive, but I am, so I drive her car, stopping along the way for coffee even though I plan on going back to sleep. Once we’ve returned to Alix’s place, Stephanie gets up for work (!) and Flip is fleetingly awake, having woken up to move his car as well. Then there is more sleep for Salma and me. We are sharing a mattress, not out of necessity but by choice. Later we will need to eat, and she will need to drive me to pick up my towed car, but for the moment there is just a cuddling, hung-over sleep. 131 My relationship with Arden, which ended two years ago, was troubled by the fact that my life wasn’t independently stable. Unless things worked out between me and her, my plans for the future could not be much more clear than “try to stay employed and happy”. My field of work, what city I lived in, and so much else about my life was still undecided. I was terrified that I would end up trapped in an inescapable poverty. I wanted so badly to be sure that in the future I could begin to live the sort of life I wanted (which was modest, but still far away). A number of factors were involved in my leaving her, but they all boiled down to the fact that I saw myself as being solely responsible for making sure I would be okay in the future. Without drastic changes, it looked like I would likely not be okay financially or logistically or socially if our relationship didn’t work out. And I think my insecurity about my own life made her insecure in our relationship. 132 Tonight I was supposed to get dinner at the Sierra Grille in Northampton with Salma and Stephanie. Then we were going to go to Alix’s and then from there head to the Deuce. Even though I would have to leave there to come to work. But then I asked if Esther could come to dinner, and Stephanie was like, “Sure!” but then, when I called Esther, Esther was like, “You don’t have to invite me along if you would rather spend tonight having a dinner with them and you’re just inviting me along because we’ve been almost-but-not-quite hanging out for the past couple of nights and you feel like you have to find a way to squeeze me in…” I ended up saying that never mind karaoke, Esther, you sound like you have a lot on your mind and would like to talk, so let’s go sit just you and I at Panera Bread instead. 133 On Monday, Jan. 17, 2011 I drive down to Hartford, Connecticut after work. Esther is at a quick doctor’s appointment, but since she’s just in the waiting room she can buzz me in to her apartment complex from her cell phone. (She left the apartment door unlocked. ) I plug in her modem/router and sit on her couch with my netbook until she arrives. I’m looking at musical instruments and recording stuff; I’ve already ordered recording software for a good price and am waiting for it to arrive in the mail. The itch to create has returned… yes, and I’ve even been able to jump quite easily back into the novel-writing. We grab some food at a little diner-place there in Hartford. The conversation between us is as it always is; it occurs to me that our conversations are an ongoing jest-fest, interspersed only with the occasional stress-induced vent by one or the other of us. When she asks me if there’s anywhere else I would like to go I drag her to Guitar Center. She is bored there, staring, annoyed-looking, into space. Then apologetic when I notice. Back at her place, we’re supposed to watch an episode of the animated show Bob’s Burgers online on Hulu, but then we’re kissing and she’s on top of me. 134 I’ve put in for a vacation day on this Friday, in anticipation of going out to karaoke with the crew. I get a text saying that no one is going, though. Instead, everyone is getting together at Alix’s. Alix, Flip, Salma, Stephanie, Meadow, Laurelei (whom I haven’t met before), Brandon, and Harry all are involved in the night. Also Jill J. , whose birthday it becomes after midnight. Instruments are played and drinks are drunk. All is as one would expect. Salma and I crash on the couch. In the morning I walk, crusty-eyed, with Salma and Stephanie to get coffee at Haymarket. Then I’m hungry… but by the time Salma and I are out and ready to do breakfast it’s already ten o’clock, and I’m remembering that I have to make sure I’ve settled on what courses I’ll be taking this semester at STCC. In Chicopee I finish choosing my classes. I drive to the STCC bookstore and take care of my business there. Then I’m back in Chicopee again, going through the process of continuing to teach myself the Reason and Record software. I wish there were more hours in the day. "

    "body": "1 Back in the Pioneer Valley, another tornado warning, and an insanely big double rainbow over the center of Amherst—the most brilliant I have ever seen. Everyone walking by stopped to look at it. It was a reminder that beauty can show up anywhere… even in the places you wish you weren’t. 2 Rosalyn came up. I tried to help make it a memorable visit. We drove to Shelburne Falls, where I showed off the Bridge of Flowers and the glacial potholes. A little bit of driving around Chicopee, where I grew up, then a massive detour way up into New Hampshire, to locales new to me, which she remembered from vacations in her childhood. Karaoke with some of my old crew (Salma, Alix, Flip, Stephanie, Brandon, Harry), although the old hangout gets very crowded full of strangers these days and we relocated to Bishop’s Lounge, where we could steal a couch and hear ourselves chat. A day trip to Boston, where she introduced me to her part-time boyfriend Chris and his wife Angela (with whom we had dinner). Her first night at a goth-type club at the new weekly event, Riot, spun by Kilean at Diva’s. (We spent most of the night sitting at the bar chatting with Tingley; she could hold her own talking about nerdy television series better than I could. ) It was nice getting to spend a substantial number of days together, especially because for most of this summer, in Pennsylvania, I usually ended up arriving at her house feeling sleep-deprived from my work schedule and grumpy from a long drive. After she returned to Pennsylvania some details about her projections for the next twelve months changed, and now it’s conceivable that she might move in with me up here by the end of this year. The company she works for is looking to see whether there will be openings in Massachusetts that she could transfer into. Then there was the two-and-a-half-week-long introductory semester of the OT program, colloquially referred to as “OT boot camp”. There was a lot of work to keep up on, and it looks as though that trend will continue, especially in this coming semester. But the attitude in the department seems to be the right one, so I found myself happy to be able to focus on learning the material and turning in quality assignments (instead of getting anxious about what sort of character I’m coming across as, how I’m dressing, and how much I am or am not fitting in with the student body). I’ve been getting along well enough with classmates, talking with lonely transplants from faraway states. Only about fifteen minutes passed from the moment when I decided to get a part-time job to the moment I was hired for one (at the Domino’s in Amherst, to work midnight to 5 AM on Fridays and Saturdays). 3 Domino’s was an easy job to get on the quick, and under the circumstances it was the only way I could think of to reliably make 60-80 dollars per night for 4 to 5 hours of work, just on the weekends, with no commitment. I volunteered to work last night—the night before Labor Day, which is also, in a town that’s built around a big university, one of the crazier weekends for pizza delivery. There weren’t enough drivers on, so I was stuffing as many as six orders into my car at once, then doing my best to find the best places to park by various high-rise dorms, passing by hordes of eighteen-to-twenty-one-year-olds—some of them cool, some of them mocking me, some of them carrying along their buddies who were too drunk to walk, some of them demanding that I should be their taxi. Our orders got backed up enough that by the end of it all (after facing further abuse from my manager—I won’t even go into that) people were opening their doors cautiously, looking a bit frightened, because it was 4 AM and they had placed their orders who knows how long prior to my arrival. But at least I have the privilege, now, of knowing that in the overall scheme of my life, this is no longer my world. I’ve moved on from this seeming like a normal way to get by. My world is one of activity analysis, research, musculoskeletal assessment, the pathways of nerves, splinting, adaptation. I asked my mother the other day: “So, how much are you going to cost me when you get old?” “Not much,” she said. “I don’t spend a lot. ” “I know, but you’re still always waiting for when the next paycheck will come in. You don’t have any retirement savings, do you?” “Are you kidding? I’ve been a restaurant cook all my life. I’ll have social security, like my father got. Twelve hundred dollars a month. That’s what he was living on. ” “Well, that and he was still working. ” “Yeah. Until the day he died. We were born working class. That’s just how it is. ” I’ve met people born into different environments who, based on the long and winding and crazy path my life has taken, see fit to characterize me as a rebel. What it’s hard to get across to people like that—(and I say this with no hostility)—is that if I had never rebelled… if I had not been able to make my own path, to make a bunch of missteps and slowly learn to believe in myself… I could never have become the sort of person they would want to have a conversation with. I wouldn’t be capable of connecting with their interests, their passions, or their vocabulary. “I should find out how to get food stamps,” joked a classmate of mine. “I must be just as poor as anyone. ” “Well, no,” I said, objecting cordially. “We can’t really call ourselves poor when we’re in a graduate program like this, knowing that we’ll make it through and that in two years, we’ll be able to make good money based on what we’re learning. It might feel like we’re poor, if we don’t have much to spend. But we’re really lucky. ” I didn’t envy her confused expression. She heard what I was saying, but the idea was new to her. Recognizing your own privilege isn’t about feeling guilty. It’s about trying to understand where you are in this society and why. 4 I get in a minor car accident while driving north from Bay Path College through Springfield. At a difficult merge one car stopped, so another car swerved out of the way and then had to stop for traffic. Then I hydroplaned. 5 Oct. 12, 2012. More people this morning are in the Springfield, MA Greyhound station than I anticipated. A distracting environment due to a loud guy striking up conversation with a woman who sat down. My train pulls up. I try to walk back a few cars, to grab a seat where I am unlikely to be surrounded by loud fellow passengers. Two minutes later, in spite of my efforts, the only talkative passengers in the car have sat in the seats immediately behind me. I have music by The Mountain Goats playing in my iPod, which I listen to through ear buds… but really, I’m less trying to listen to the music and more trying to get as close as possible to a feeling of privacy and alone-ness. I’ve planned for myself several hours today of wandering around New York City. New York is usually good to me. It lends me that feeling of soothing anonymity. No need to worry about pleasing anyone by appearing any certain way there. It’s relaxing, on this train, to watch places pass by… to remember that I am bigger than any fifty mile radius. 6 Once I get to Penn Station, I follow the directions I wrote on an index card in advance. This takes me to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to which I have somehow never before been. I search for a place that I more or less randomly read about online, but I can’t find it and end up at a different coffee place instead. 7 Eventually I went back to Manhattan, got some food, then caught the bus to Center City and the El to West Philly, where Allison was living now. There she was, exhaling dramatically, pushing her bicycle—just as I remembered her. The two of us stopped at a pizza place, ate pizza, drank beer. She told me about her plans to move to Georgia with her friend, who is also living in Philly right now but who is expected to move down there to do subsistence farming. Allison’s plan is to live out there while doing the work for a distance learning Master’s program. Then there was a day with Rosalyn. More of this day than I expected was spent helping her get things ready to be packed up and loaded into a U-Haul trailer. Bruce came. Kaylee the dog barked a lot, protective of Rosalyn. Things were loaded up into the trailer. Rosalyn let Kaylee into the little car carrier. Eventually I let the dog out and into my lap, and she was better with Bruce, at least while he was just seated next to her. Then I was living with a chihuahua in Chicopee. 8 And I’m suddenly unable to deliver pizzas because my car is in the repair shop. But I have a lot of schoolwork to do, anyway. 9 We feel a little earthquake just before a presidential debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney. 10 Kaylee gets used to my mom, to my mom’s chihuahua Pedro, and to Bruce. 11 On a rainy morning, as I am sitting in the driver’s seat alone in my mother’s car and reviewing flash cards, trying to cram information into my brain for the test I am about to take, I find out through Britta on Facebook that her friend Becca from Smith, with whom the two of us went to see that Dresden Dolls Halloween concert in Boston back in 2004, has suddenly and unexpectedly died. I do poorly on the test. 12 My father publishes something on Descartes in a Catholic magazine, Faith, based in the U. K. I read the first couple of paragraphs on my phone, but the technology is fickle and I have trouble reading more than that. 13 My mother accidentally refers to her chihuahua, Pedro, by my name rather frequently. 14 Salma’s birthday happens. Everyone knows that a hurricane will be hitting us in a couple days. I’m the first person at Packards; Derrick is the second one. He tells me that he quit drinking a few months back. I talk about how I quit cigarettes a year and a half ago. Then Salma and her woman friends come by from their time at the hot tubs. I’ve ordered nachos for her/for me/for the table. Basically, the newcomers have a round of drinks, then we proceed to India House. I’m skeptical but beginning to learn to like Indian food. We stay there for a bit, then move on to Hugo’s. I play pool with Salma’s old friend Sarah W. , who likes my recent facial hair growth. (“It makes you look older,” Jim mentioned when the subject had been raised. “You look, like, twenty-seven instead of twenty-two. ”) Then I talk about the occupational therapy program I’m in to someone who is interested in applying to the same program. Then most of us are in Easthampton. I don’t know whose party it is, but judging by the fact that most people are in costume, I can infer that this is a Halloween celebration. There is a soft taco bar. Stephanie and I throw down our tacos onto a hot plate and enjoy the yummy goodness. Some folks drink alcohol from an ice luge. Then I’m outside having party conversation, first functioning as a chair for Stephanie and then using Salma as a chair. Then I’m home and taking the dog out even though it’s the middle of the night, just to be safe. I go to sleep completely forgetting that I signed up for a “craft day” at school in the morning. (The requirement is to attend one of a series of sessions, or else to pay for some sort of extracurricular crafting course. ) 15 Oct. 31. Where I was, in western Massachusetts, just had a somewhat windy day, but from southern Connecticut to the mid-Atlantic were various scenes of hurricane damage. I kept inside, writing article summaries based on research for a big paper. It’s the sort of assignment a professor talks about in class for hours, about which you meet with that professor three times, and even as you’re ready to turn in twelve full single-spaced pages attached to twelve articles you’ve dug up you regret that you spent so much time trying to meet all the various criteria the professor has at various points said you should try to include, because you know there is a good chance you will be graded according to a strict, simple standard having little or nothing to do with anything discussed, so what you really should have done was talk to more of your classmates about it, because undoubtedly some of them would have spoken to people who did the assignment in the previous year, but whatever. 16 Nov. 16. It basically feels like I’ve begun a four week long period of finals, which Thanksgiving will be interrupting. My fender bender prevented me from having my own car to use, and now it appears that I am sort of just an informal employee at Domino’s. I have no strong feelings about this. 17 Rosalyn arrived and started arranging her possessions somewhat. Then we went to Medford to spend time with Chris and Angela. 18 I couldn’t have known when purchasing advance tickets to see Amanda Palmer and the Grand Theft Orchestra at the Paradise in Boston that the show would involve a tribute to someone I had been acquainted with, someone who was still alive when I bought the tickets. Amanda played Death Cab for Cutie’s “I Will Follow You into the Dark”, then read one of Becca’s poems. Before she was finished with the poem I told Rosalyn I was going to the men’s room. I ducked through the theatrically-dressed Thursday night audience, past the kind bartender who had with admirable honesty let me know when I had misheard the cost of my drink and set down an unnecessary amount of money, into the one stall squished into a small room with three super-awkwardly aligned urinals. I checked my phone, which I saw had received a text message from Helena, whom I met in Boston ten years ago in a record shop. 19 Then, because there was an unexpected delay in her start date in Massachusetts (due to issues in the process of getting a Massachusetts license for practicing as a PTA) Rosalyn went back in Pennsylvania, staying with former co-workers while working shifts where she used to work.

    "body": "122 “It’s actually disturbing how hard it is to make a dog not be loyal to you. If you treat it like an asshole from the start, it will always perceive you as the enemy. But if you start off being nice and then turn into an asshole, the dog will just keep wondering, ‘What did I do wrong?’” I nod. “Of course, humans react the same way. What you’re describing is pretty much exactly what society does to its children. ” I finish making our morning coffees. I take mine a little darker than Rosalyn takes hers. 123 We skip a barbeque being thrown by Salma’s boyfriend Eric, because we’re on a roll and getting some cleaning done for a change. I also finish this summer’s round of edits to the Life Story, upload the PDF files to Lulu (the site I use for my on-demand printing of the physical books) and put all my collected writings together in various up-to-date forms of backup. Then there is our latest nighttime walk. Rosalyn recently came into a $50 Dunkin Donuts card, so we have often been walking there and getting a midnight snack before returning to the house. While making our way through the residential neighborhoods we talk more about her ideas for getting into a tiny house that could serve as her residence when she starts school next year (she just recently found out that it is now possible to get “RV loans” for tiny houses, and she thinks this might be a way to pitch to her father, who will be paying for her schooling, the idea of tiny house ownership in place of apartment renting while she gets that next degree); about what she should do to try to get sufficient observation hours with an OT as soon as possible (I tell her I will try to help out by finding local volunteer settings); and about what she might like her career arc to look like once she becomes an OT (although in the short term after graduating she expects to just have to work in one of the settings where more of the jobs are, in the long term she has interests in more specialized practice areas such as hippotherapy, NICU, and hand therapy, as well as some thoughts about how she would love to provide specialized consulting services for clients with chronic conditions who would benefit from lifestyle changes in and out of the home). 124 “I didn’t fill the cup all the way!” says Rosalyn, looking proud of herself. She holds up the frozen yogurt cup as we cross Memorial Drive in Chicopee, having just purchased her treat from Yogurt City. “Very good!” I smile. “I wish they had smaller cups to use. With these big ones, it’s hard to resist just filling it up to the top. ” “Well, of course it is,” I say. “That’s why the cups are so big at all these self-serve yogurt places! If the cups are that size, you’ll think it’s normal to get $7 worth. If the cups were smaller, you’d only think it was normal to get, whatever, $3 worth, and why would the business want that?” “Most of the time, I just see the cup and I can’t resist. ” “I’m surprised you would be so suggestible and easy to manipulate!” “Well,” she says, “I want to keep eating. I want to eat a lot of yogurt. ” She sounds a bit like she has been insulted. “Wow,” I say. “Even the mildest teasing toward you just does not work out. ” “I tend to take teasing as an attack, because in my experience it usually has been. ” We continue to walk, then, more quiet than before. A carful of young passengers drives by, honking while a young woman in the vehicle stands with her upper half poking through the sunroof, pulling up her shirt and flashing her breasts at us and at the car behind us and at the trees and at the skunks and at the darkness of a long road leading to a military base. 125 “How was your walk?” she asks me even later in the night, after I have gone out again for the light exercise, this time alone. “Eh,” I say. “Why? What happened?” “Well, the first car I saw started honking its horn at me. ” “You’re kidding me. Again?” “Then it slowed down, turned around, and drove back toward me. So I tried to go down the next side street, but there must have been a house fire there, because there were two fire trucks blocking the road there. But the car I was trying to avoid had stopped after passing me again, so I just stood around, sort of near the fire trucks, until the car left. Then I came back to our neighborhood and walked in circles around the block a couple of times. ” 126 As we wait for our food at the Applebee’s to which our walk has circuitously led us, I find that Rosalyn is smiling at me. “What are you thinking about?” I ask her. “That this has been quite a year,” she says, holding the smile. “In what respect?” “Well, the first and most recent time I met Allison was when I was just getting to know you. ” “Oh, that’s right. In my apartment. ” “Yes. ” “And you brought your strawberry shortcake. ” “I did. You liked it. ” “I definitely did. ” “And your doorman was really interested in who you were dating, too. ” “Oh? Oh, was that at night?” “It was. ” “I know the guy you mean, then. That was… I wish I could remember his name. But he was probably interested because he was always talking with Allison, having these long talks when she was coming to and leaving from my apartment. ” “Maybe. He asked me if I was your mother at first. ” “What?” “He did. He said, ‘Isn’t Levi like eighteen years old or something?’ And I had to be like, ‘Nope, he’s thirty, or thirty-one, or whatever you were at the time. He said, ‘Damn, those are good genes. ’ That place was great. I loved your apartment. ” “You loved my apartment? I loved my apartment. ” “The first time I went in, too, you were with your car and driving around while I went in to get something. I had never known anyone who lived in a place like that, either, so high up in the middle of the city. So I got to walk in and see the view right away, as I walked in, just bam. It was wonderful. ” Once we’re back from our walk (and after she has showered—decontaminating after a walk is always important for Rosalyn) we watch two more episodes of Breaking Bad on my laptop while she continues to tweak the latest iteration of her tiny house design on her own. Breaking Bad has enough good qualities that I don’t mind watching it through along with more or less everyone else in America, but among other problems I have with the series, the number of times one character just happens to run into another at a crucial moment is ludicrous. Then again, as I know by now, the connections that happen in real life get pretty silly, too. Allison, for example, now has plans to move to Northampton. 127 I wake up with just enough time to shower and meet Allison in Northampton. I tell her to find me in Thornes Marketplace. She says she would like a burger, so I introduce her to Packards. I get veggie burger. She tells me that Georgia didn’t turn out to be a good time—she was sick, she ended up having problems with some of the people she knew down there, it just didn’t work out. After we’ve finished eating, we move on to Haymarket. I talk to her about where to go in Northampton for drinks, for groceries, for different types of food. I ask her how she got set up with the place in Northampton. She tells me that her friend found a place for really cheap, under 400 per month. Who’s the friend? Her friend in Philly who is from here originally—the guy who is now, coincidentally, casually dating Edith. Anyway, do I want to spy on her place? “Sure,” I say, and so we walk to her street. Allison whispers to me: “The girl walking there on the other side of the street is the girl whose room I’m taking. ” “I think I knew that girl,” I say. “Sarah?” “Yes! Sarah X. We were friends before she left the area to go to college. We lost touch, then. ” Allison and I walk down some different streets. I point out some more places. “Nice seeing you,” I say when we’re ready to part. “While we’re back in Massachusetts, we should both make sure we don’t get bored and feel isolated and shut ourselves in. ” 128 I get up from the bed to pee around sunrise and find somehow that I can’t fall back to sleep. I make Rosalyn some oatmeal, then, and I click-scroll my way across the Internet for a while. I find and immediately share on Facebook an article called “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs” posted by David Graeber, because it articulates things I have long said about (and which have come to inform my choices about how to live within) the world I and my peer group are inheriting. Few things upset me so deeply as that pervasive and deadly idea that any sort of unpleasant effort (“work”) done at another’s behest is virtuous regardless of what it does or does not do for society. That idea leads to the dehumanization of those who are seen as enjoying overmuch the things they do (the people who are “not working” or at least are “not working hard enough”) and limits people’s ability to tap into their natural interests and abilities. It’s a scourge on public health that keeps the lower classes in place and serves no other function. (Zero people “like” my link. ) 129 Further adventures in walking around Chicopee: as Rosalyn and I stand at the side of the road, someone shoots silly string at us out the passenger’s side window. “This town is like Lord of the Flies,” I say. “It’s getting to the point where I can’t disagree with you,” says Rosalyn. 130 We take a drive out to Boston to pick up Rosalyn’s friend Emilie, who is arriving in Massachusetts by bus for a four-day visit. Rosalyn and I walk around. We pass through Chinatown. We eat at a restaurant. Emilie arrives on time at South Station. We take the T to the car and the Pike back to Chicopee. Thursday involves some time spent in Northampton, then a stop at Atkins to pick up some things, and a trip to the Hampshire Mall to see The World’s End. I thoroughly enjoy the movie, but both Rosalyn and Emilie (whose tastes in entertainment differ from mine) struggle on the drive back from the cinema to explain what exactly it was that left them feeling let down by it. Friday is a long day of driving to different places along a general course I’ve planned out for us. We start with brunch at Sylvester’s, where we talk about wanting to have children vs. not wanting children. (Emilie does want them. ) Feeling bold, I test out something I have been thinking about but have not yet voiced to anyone: “I might want children if I lived in a different country, but I just can’t feel like it’s a thing I want to do in the U. S. ” I say that my concern is not just what it could do to my life to have a child with exceptional special needs (or how difficult it could become to provide any sort of health care at all for a child under the wrong circumstances), but that I don’t agree in general with most of what it’s taken as normal for a child to be put through here. “Right, like the school system,” Rosalyn says, but I mean even more than that. I mean that I don’t feel on the same page with the parents I’ve known and met. I wouldn’t want to buy into a culture that valorizes self-destruction in the name of family. (This is another thing about Breaking Bad I take an unpopular view on: even at the outset, when the show’s central character takes to manufacturing meth with the expectation that he will leave the money to his family at his death, I find him completely unsympathetic, not just an anti-hero but a transparent villain who despite living in a nice middle-class home and earning above the average family income decides after decades of steady work that he would rather be a murderous criminal than fail to look like a superhero in his role as the head of a household. Most viewers seem to take his motivation as genuine and relatable even as his attempts to keep his middle-class family comfortable are at the expense of the lives of lower-class drug users, street dealers, and various Mexicans, who for all we know maybe got into the drug trade for reasons similar to Walt’s. ) I don’t believe that stern parenting is something in which to take pride. I don’t believe in hitting children. I don’t believe in sexism. I do believe in self-expression, art, and humor. I also believe in academic rigor. Where on the planet would be better for a fatherly version of myself I don’t know, but I do feel like my ways of getting around America’s normalizing consumerist pressures would be in danger of short-circuiting if I also had to plan my life in such a way as to raise a kid and maintain the identity of a father. Then we drive to Shelburne Falls, where we get ice cream for Emilie and where Rosalyn shows off the Bridge of Flowers, the glacial pot holes, and some of the little stores there. Emilie naps in the back seat as we pass through the prettiest parts of the Mohawk Trail. In North Adams we stop at the Gramercy Bistro, but look at the menu and find it too expensive and then instead walk the couple of blocks to Public, a gastropub that is a hit with everyone. Then we go to the Cummington Fair, see some barn animals, eat some fried Oreo cookies and funnel cake and fried cheesecake-on-a-stick, and find and talk to Salma as she works the booth for the Center for Women and Community. Then Emilie is getting cold—amazing in August, even in the hill towns—and the fair is ending anyway, so we get going. After a stop for ingredients at a supermarket, Emilie hangs out in our kitchen for a bit and prepares her own homemade macaroni and cheese. A DVD about tiny house construction Rosalyn won from a design contest has arrived in the mail, so she shows select sections of it to Emilie, then to me, then to me again in order to highlight parts I might not have fully absorbed the first time. Then Emilie is falling asleep on the living room floor, and Rosalyn and I are headed to the bedroom for sleep, and then it’s the morning and they’re leaving to spend the next two days in Boston and I’m sleeping for most of the day. 131 Classes start again. 132 I help Rosalyn research places in the area that might allow her to get in the observation hours she needs before applying to OT programs. 133 I only have one class on Tuesday. It’s the lecture for Dr. Vaughn’s Pediatrics class, and it pretty much flies by as we just go over the syllabus and then split into groups to discuss the Backpack Awareness Day presentations we are doing at various area grade schools. After that class, I find Dr. Sladyk to ask about my fieldwork thing, which still has been not arranged. She says, “I have no news for you, because I have not had a moment of free time. ” She says something about someone being interested, however. I’m not sure what she means, but she is looking rushed, so I just quickly plan to look for her on Thursday to see if she has any new information. 134 Salma calls me. “I’m at the Amherst Starbucks,” I say. “Oh, wow,” she says. “I just left Amherst. I’m on my way to Easthampton. ” She tells me that she is exhausted from a combination of her usual work schedule and moving to her new apartment and her recent visits to help her parents in New Jersey move, too, and all the days in a row she just spent at the booth at the Cummington Fair. She is calling because she was thinking about our plans to get together on Thursday and she would kind of rather meet with me on Wednesday (tomorrow) instead, since she will have Thursday and Friday off and the idea of doing things on her own for two days in a row without a schedule to abide by sounds really appealing. I tell her that that will be totally fine. On the topic of her new apartment, she mentions that her friends and their little kid live upstairs, that she always hears the sound of the kid’s feet scampering around above her. “It’s so cute!” she says. “I’m probably the only person who would think that was just adorable and wonderful…” “Rather than annoying, yeah,” I say, completing her sentence. She mentions that her birthday will be coming up in a couple of months. “I’m turning thirty-five,” she reminds me. “Congratulations!” “I’m kind of sad about it,” she says, “But actually, I’ve been a little bit less sad, because I have Eric and so it feels like having kids is a little bit closer. But anyway. I’m thinking of going out for dinner with people that Friday or something. ” This leads to a minor conversational digression to the topic of how people seem more likely to remember plans that they are told about far in advance and then reminded of regularly. The digression doesn’t go very far, however. She truly is tired, and after re-confirming that our plans are a go for tomorrow, we end our conversation and I head to UMass to drop off that book on the Model of Human Occupation I borrowed and to work on my new application for the M. A. in Writing Program at Johns Hopkins. 135 “Hey,” my mother says to me as I am just starting to walk up the stairs. “That occupational therapist at Kim’s school that you did the fieldwork or whatever with?” “Yeah?” “Kim said that she talked to her and that if you ever need anything, you should talk to her. Said she really liked you. ” So although it’s the sort of thing I hate doing, I write the following in an email to her: “Hi, Cindy! I have a question for you. My girlfriend, Rosalyn, is going through the process of applying to OT programs for next year. She is a PTA and has worked with OTs before, but most programs specifically want to see observation hours. Her work experience is in long-term care and rehab, so she would love to branch out by seeing what OT looks like for a pediatric population. I’m not sure how common or how easy to arrange that sort of observation is outside of a hospital setting. Do you ever have prospective students shadow you in your work settings, and would you consider it in this case? Alternately, do you have any suggestions I can pass on to her?” She quickly gets back to me and agrees. "

    "body": "136 I go with Salma to Northampton. We eat at the Northampton Brewery, then go for a beer at the Dirty Truth. We talk about our relationships and the potentials therein. “Oh, Levi. We’ll always be friends,” she says to me. Later in the night, after I have gone home and helped Rosalyn a bit while she worked on her application through the Occupational Therapy Centralized Application Service, we walk Kaylee, then go for our own little walk, along the sidewalk of mostly-empty streets at around 1:30 in the morning. A car passes. Rosalyn shrieks as something hits her. She says that she thinks it was a water balloon or something. It has left moisture on her and, she says, “It felt like a bolus as it made its impact. ” Fortunately, we are not far from our current place of residence. We have a quick conversation about what this ongoing pattern of animosity toward us from passing cars says about my hometown: “So this is Chicopee, huh?” she says. “This is Chicopee,” I say, nodding. “Where I come from, that would be the sort of behavior that the other kids looked down upon. ” “Well, my three friends and I certainly looked down upon the other thousands of kids surrounding us. ” “You would have been one of the popular kids in my school,” she says. It’s an assertion she has made before. Since we have no way of confirming exactly what hit her, when we get back to the apartment she strips and has me hold open a garbage bag for her to store her clothes in. “The liquid felt disturbingly warm,” she says. 137 I give Dr. Sladyk a call. “Hello,” she says. “Hi. This is Levi Adams. ” “This isn’t a good time. I’m teaching a lecture. ” “Sorry. I’ll get in touch with you later. ” She’s answering her phone during a lecture? What? 138 That night, while I sit on the floor and download articles for my classes from an academic database, Rosalyn writes her statement of purpose for OT schools. I’m impressed by how quickly she is able to draft a quality statement… that sort of thing takes me forever. 139 Rosalyn has been noticing Kaylee scratching a lot and has also been feeling at times as if insects were biting her. (I have not been feeling anything, but I know from experience—that time many years ago when I found out lice had grown to extraordinary size within my then-long hair—that I am pretty oblivious to such minor discomforts. ) First she texts, then she calls. She leaves me speechless when she seems to to be scolding us for not having the fumigation process finished before she gets to work. This was her idea, her solution to a problem caused most likely by her dog, about whom my mother has long been asking, “Is Kaylee given the sort of flea stuff we give Pedro?” 140 The, the day after the fumigation, after much washing of laundry and dishes while Rosalyn is at work, we find fleas on Kaylee for the first time. 141 Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman will be holding an event in Boston in memory of Becca. I’ve bought tickets. 142 Rosalyn knew my doubts. She insisted that she wanted to move somewhere anyway, that she saw Massachusetts as an opportunity in itself. I shouldn’t feel guilty for giving us a chance. 143 As has been happening every now and then for as long as I have been alive, another big report is issued and then reported in the media about how man-made global warming is progressing more than predicted. I try to account for this sort of information when thinking through my life and determining what I want out of it. But it feels both too big and too uncertain to really account for. 144 I find myself oddly passionate about a case study we discuss in class—a high school senior, seventeen, with more going for her in life than most people I have known. Yet, my classmates were insistent that they wanted her to aim low because of her visual impairments and because her parents were not rich. Really, I think part of the OT curriculum should be education about how people with disabilities live. We should want people with obvious impairments to feel that they have more options than to just play the role of the broken human being unable to function. 145 Nothing is yours forever but what you’ve overcome. 146 Rosalyn is driving her car with me in the passenger’s seat. We’re passing through the town of Granby. I point out the Cumberland Farms. “I worked at that convenience store,” I tell her, “After I graduated from college. ” My tone of voice while saying this leads her to a moment of reflection, then to saying, “I’m so happy for you. ” “Yeah?” “You’ve been looking for your path to independence for so long, and this is it. ” “This?” “This whole path you’re on, the occupational therapy thing. ” “Well, I hope you’re right. ” “You’re not going to assume anything until you’re there?” “Pretty much. ” 147 A conversation with a barber (while he cuts my hair way shorter than I asked for him to cut it): Him: “Are you from Amherst?” Me: “From the area, yeah. I grew up in Chicopee. ” Him: “I spent a year at Bellamy for middle school. I hated it. ” Me: “That’s where I went, yeah. It was pretty awful. ” Him: “The teachers there were, like, running with the gangs along with the students. It was crazy. ” It feels good to commiserate with someone on how awful a place that school was. 148 Allison and I have plans to meet up on this particular Saturday, but exactly what we are to do has been left up in the air. “I was told there’s a burlesque show going on in the back room at the World War II Club,” she says, “And Sam is supposed to be there. ” Sam is a guy she has met here in the Valley, whom she is now starting to date. I say that sure, some burlesque at the World War II Club sounds like a fun enough way to spend a Saturday night. While waiting in line for my first drink I’m surprised and delighted to see June, who runs up to me, says, “Levi!” and gives me a hug. “I didn’t even know you were back in this area!” I say to her. “I’m not! I’m still in Beverly,” she says. “I’m just here for the weekend. ” She comments that the two of us haven’t seen each other for about a decade. By the end of our conversation she has mentioned that if I ever need a place to stay when visiting the Boston area, she has one to offer. The word “burlesque” could be used to describe events both fun and awful, so I’m pleased to find that the night’s performances are silly, entertaining, and fun to watch. “This is a theme I’ve been looking forward to having for about a year now, because it’s fucking weird,” says the host. The first dancer is a woman in a full chicken suit, who strips down entirely to her bikini bottom and pasties before removing her chicken head. Next is a man on stilts in a giraffe costume. The coup de grâce is the ten-foot fabric giraffe schlong he lets fall to the stage at the end. The host loses my good will at the point in the night when he starts asking for audience volunteers. He starts by asking for a bisexual. At first no one volunteers, which does not surprise me. Every bisexual knows that spaces which are safe for all other queers are still rarely safe for bisexuals. And indeed the host, a gay man, does not do himself any favors if he hopes to assure the bisexuals in the audience that they will not be mocked: “We’re looking for a bisexual, someone who can be an impartial judge of the various people we will bring up here,” he says. “And I don’t mean that every seven years you get with someone of the same sex. ” Finally, a man volunteers and sits in the chair. “So here we have the bisexual! The unicorn of sexual orientations!” …Yeah. Gee, I wonder why more of us aren’t out. I lean over and whisper in Allison’s ear: “Lots of respect shown for bisexual identities, as always. ” Being a member of an oppressed class does not mean that you’re not doing the work of the oppressors for them. And it seems to me that a gay man who mocks the sexual identities of other people whom straight culture would identify as gay men (since the straight world sees any homosexual proclivities in men as indicators of unconfessed homosexuality) is doing just that. Also, you’re just being a dick. The choice I have is to lie about what who I am and how I understand myself or to live disenfranchised. Do I really deserve scorn for that? He reacts in a scoffing manner, too, to the (beautiful) woman among the volunteer dancers who identifies herself only as “queer”. And that is after he has solicited those dancers by asking for “a gay man, a lesbian, a straight man, a straight woman, a trans man, a trans woman, as many different types as we can find…” As if audience members are going to be excited to go up there and be identified that way, not simply as a man or woman but as a token trans man or trans woman. (At some point Sam has arrived and has sat across the aisle from Allison, who is sitting next to me. ) Pointing at somebody’s tee shirt, which reads “Sleater-Kinney is for lovers,” I say to Allison, “Hey! Remember when we went to the Wild Flag show at Union Transfer in Philly?” Then, because I know I have been saying things like this a lot to her in the course of the night, I add, “Someday, I’m going to say, ‘Hey, remember that time in Northampton when I kept trying to reminisce about Philly with you?’” While Allison and Sam dance on the floor I chat with Sunny, who is a graduate student in sociology trying to research the culture of trans people on their own terms rather than in light of how they do or do not conform to the norms of the larger culture. “Aw, you were talking with little Sunny,” Allison says. Even when her tone of voice is sort of condescending, it’s still warm, and I still enjoy her. 149 A hawk just slammed into the window at this Denny’s, then made glaring eye contact with me. Whatever, bird. It’s not my fault you’re trying to attack a bottle of ketchup through plate glass. 150 Two important things to know about Northampton, MA are (1. ) there are free-to-pick garden plots along the bicycle path through the center of town and (2. ) this morning I was able to pick four delicious-looking craft beers out of them. 151 Visiting Grandma with Rosalyn. Not actually telling my father. My aunt Madeline coming over. Me finding myself greatly disappointed as the two of them start making racist statements about “the Blacks”. 152 Driving with Rosalyn through New Hampshire and Maine. It turns out she enjoys Portland a lot. 153 And Becca’s memorial. I end up going with June, actually. I rendezvous with her at the Somerville T stop, then we walk up and down the street while she checks out the menus of different places to find the most reasonably-priced place for us to grab dinner. (She blames this trait of hers on being Jewish. ) She and I then spend the last hour before the event sitting on stools in a surprisingly empty bar, leaning against hardwood. She reflects about Mandy, saying that she met up with her quasi-recently and learned that she (Mandy) still thought of her (June) as sort of “the one who got away. ” “And,” June adds, half-whispering, “We were only ever tertiaries. ” “So you’re the tertiary that got away?” I laugh. “Yeah,” she says. “It was sad, really. ” I take another sip of my beer. Then we go to the venue, take our different seats and watch different performers speak about Becca. Neil Gaiman reads. We watch the Dresden Dolls play a couple of songs. Then we part. 154 I run my life story groups in a graduate student dorm at Bay Path. 155 And I sit uncomfortably on stage during the pinning ceremony. The coursework component of my OT degree is completed. 156 Then I drive to Rosalyn’s mother’s house in Columbia, Maryland, through a perilous snowstorm, with Rosalyn in the passenger’s seat. This is where I’ve arranged to stay for the next six months while I complete my level II fieldwork placements. Rosalyn will still be living in Massachusetts. 157 I begin my first clinical placement—in the psych ward of Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. "

    "body": "20	For various reasons, but mostly because I’ve pretty much been spending every day trying to do what I need to do, with little time to relax or engage in more discretionary activities, I’ve been steadily gaining weight again. I really have fluctuated over the years. 21	After leaving Charles Village, Baltimore, the day before Thanksgiving, I found my way to the Inner Harbor, which is the part of town all the tourist guides to Baltimore will steer a person toward. In fact there was little to do or see there that could not be seen or done inside any large shopping mall. Still, one amusing little scene happened. 	I was walking through the… well, through the actual mall that was there, one of those urban-style malls as vertical as it is horizontal. Looking at my shoes, I realized that I had packed and was wearing my older, more worn down pair of leather shoes. If only, I thought to myself, I could get a shoe shine. And lo! Although this was indeed the twenty-first century, an age in which people selling shoe shines are not nearly so common as movies tell me they were in the early twentieth century, THERE WAS A DUDE OFFERING SHOE SHINES. 	So then there I was, getting a shoe shine in Baltimore by a guy who saw fit to tell me about his esoteric studies. He said we’re transitioning into a new age—a better time. He had it on good authority, he said, and what’s more he could see the signs all around him. When he was a kid, the things he sees on television now—the sex, the violence, the cynicism—would never have been aired. People don’t look after each other the way they once did. 	“But, as times change, it’ll lead to something better, you think? So in a way, you’re optimistic?” I asked. His spiel was diverted by this. He had been deep in the groove of moral rhapsody. 	Occasionally, someone passing by would say hello to the shoe shine man. “That’s Jose,” the shoe shine guy would say. “He’s a good guy. ” Then he, a Black man, would lament how “some people” would dismiss Spanish speakers, or other groups of Americans. But they’re good people, too, he would say. They’re just different. 	All of this was further cementing in my mind the idea that the city of Baltimore is sort of like a living museum of the twentieth century in America. It really is a weird place. 22	I parked on the street across from Rosalyn’s sister Colleen’s house. I called Rosalyn and she was in the process of parking—not a process she loves—but right away Colleen and her fiancé and her fiancé’s daughter had spotted me parking, even though they had not met me before, and they were saying Hey, and I was saying Oh, I think Rosalyn is parking right now. And they’re like, Yeah, the kid is running down the sidewalk in Rosalyn’s direction, to meet with her. 	Dinner is served right away. They have been waiting for us. The food is very good, all homemade, surprisingly elaborate. Then there was sitting in the basement media room (or whatever they call it) of this row home to watch The Expendables 2, a ludicrous action movie. 	In the upstairs bedroom Rosalyn and I were up forever, talking about this and that. Conversation between us can seem bland for a little bit, then feel almost contentious when it comes to basic lifestyle preferences, then feel “right” as it occurs to me that some of the things I say that others would see as opaque actually come across to Rosalyn as totally straightforward. 23	Dec. 6, 2012. Now I’m at the Lady Killigrew Café at the Montague Book Mill in Montague, Massachusetts. It’s about a quarter past one o’clock in the afternoon. Earlier today I attended my last class of the semester, excepting finals. I came here to Montague expecting that I could either study for one of my finals or think some more about my future plans in life regarding money and work and degrees and geographic location. My laptop battery is dead, though, and no seats are open next to any outlets. And when I use my phone to try to connect to the Bay Path College online system I find that that web site is not loading. Well, at least it’s a nice day, for December in New England. 	I had to wake up for breakfast, that morning in Baltimore at Rosalyn’s sister’s place. Rosalyn, though she had been awake as late as I had, did just fine as far as getting up. I was distraught, although I apparently concealed that fact well. Anyway, the food was again delicious, though. 	Rosalyn and I picked up her mother in Columbia, then headed I-don’t-know-where for Thanksgiving. Meeting the extended family of someone you’re dating is… well…	…have I ever even done that before? I don’t know that I have. 	Oysters were steamed outside. It was my first time trying them. They were all right. Throughout the day I might have been trying a little too hard to be polite, watching others before making a move for anything. But things went fine. Then, to bed in Baltimore again. What I had met on this day was Rosalyn’s mother’s family—the larger Thanksgiving dinner of the two we were going to experience. The second, smaller Thanksgiving, for her father’s family Thanksgiving, was the following day. 24	When I met Rosalyn’s father, who is an accomplished engineer, he was trying to solve a problem from his thirteen-year-old daughter’s Algebra 1 textbook. He was trying when we walked in; he was trying when Rosalyn, Colleen, and I sat down at the kitchen table with the aforementioned youngest daughter; he was trying when the salutatory chit-chat had wound down and the table found itself silent. “I don’t know what they want you to do for this question,” he said, sliding the heavy textbook back across the table. 	I jumped in, then: “Could I see the book? What I would do is turn it into a reading comprehension problem!” I was surprised to find that this provoked laughter from all around the table. I hadn’t meant it as a joke. “No, really!” I said. “The problem is just a few pages into the chapter. Maybe if we look at the larger arc of what they’re trying to teach, we can figure out what they want you to do. ” But Rosalyn’s father, who holds five academic degrees, dismissed my approach and found the solution in his own way. 	Rosalyn has a general preoccupation with rules both written and unwritten. This quality, I was beginning to see, was prominent on her father’s side of the family as well. Far be it from me to make a fool of myself by seeming overeager to drink at Thanksgiving, then: I turned down the first glass of wine I was offered, although Colleen and her father freely enjoyed the red that had been opened. 	At one point, in reaction to a strain of conversation in which Rosalyn, Colleen, and their father laughed about the quality of perfectionism in the family, I began to say, “I never had it in my head to want to be perfect. I think while I was growing up, I never had anyone around being held up as experts, or…”	“No,” Rosalyn’s father interrupted. “It’s not about that. It’s something that comes from inside. ”	I thought back to that moment several times as the Thanksgiving went on. What an interesting point, I thought, for a successful person in an intimidating field to want to assert so strongly. It was, I thought, a defense of the narrative of meritocratic success, without which he and his peer group would surely disappear. 	Rosalyn, Colleen, and I went for a walk around the neighborhood, from cul-de-sac to cul-de-sac. The two of them talked for a bit about their brother, who was not down for the holiday. Then Colleen’s fiancé and his boy came over. And it was me and the boy, sitting on the floor, playing some weird version of Monopoly that I had never seen. 	It was a game of Monopoly in which 	everything was more expensive,	and it was hard for me to see	the point. 25	As soon as we arrived at Rosalyn’s friend Claire’s apartment in Whatevertown, Maryland, it was time for the two of them to go. I was kindly given a quick tour of the apartment, which I was to have to myself while the two of them went out contra dancing. 	My hope was that this would be the part of my time in Maryland when I finally got some work done for school, but as had happened a couple of days before in Baltimore, technology interfered. This time, Claire’s wireless Internet farted out. 	Time is easy to kill in this day and age, though, so I just read things online using my phone until I got a text message from Rosalyn asking if I wanted to come along for some food. I was surprised that I was still awake, let alone up for a diner trip, but I was. 	So there we were—Rosalyn and Claire and I, plus Tom and later, even Mary. I was tired and probably unable to provide the others much entertainment, but I did suggest to Rosalyn the immediately popular idea that a Thanksgiving of her Maryland friends become a new tradition along with her family gatherings. 	In the morning I got an oil change, bought a sandwich in a little place where for some reason a guy with an acoustic guitar was playing Sublime’s “What I Got”, and fueled up before hitting the highway. 26	In the days that followed, Rosalyn decided that for the sake of her overall body wellness she should spend two weeks in the Boston area, receiving massages everyday from a specialized massage therapist she knows there. She planned for one evening to sleep next to me in Chicopee before heading out there. 	I had almost no spare time at this point—school was requiring consistent, unceasing effort on my part—so although I missed her, I at least was not going to have to feel bad for all the time I wouldn’t have been able to spend with her anyway. 27	Then, I had written it into my schedule that I would go to another crafting class on Friday, December 7, at the Joann Fabrics in Leominster, Massachusetts. I was planning to take a class so far away because it had to meet certain requirements—I was only doing it because I had been assigned to do it for a course—and after taking a 2. 5 hour quilting class in Manchester, Connecticut I had wanted to push back the other 2. 5 of my required 5 hours to as late a date as I could so that taking a silly class would not get in the way of my working on assignments during the semester. 	But I called the store and they told me that because no one else had signed up for it in advance the class—whatever class it had been—was canceled. 	Simultaneously, Rosalyn was texting me about how much getting certain types of massage helped for her chronic pain, but how worried it made her that it was so difficult and expensive for her to maintain a basic level of physical comfort: “If I didn’t do anything to try to make my body better, I would be crippled before the age of forty. ”	“What do doctors think, when you talk to them about it?” I asked, and she answered, “They say it’s nothing. Or they offer me pain pills and say there’s nothing to be done. ” And more references to Scarlett O’Hara. Alone during the day while her secondary boyfriend and his wife are away at their respective jobs, she has been re-reading Gone with the Wind. 28	It’s approaching four o’clock in the morning. I have five pizza orders in my car. Four of them need to go to various units at Puffton Village Apartments. 	The first delivery is unremarkable: I say the price, I’m given the cash, and I hand over the product. 	(Driving to the next delivery, I pass by the dumpster, which I may or may not accurately remember as where I first kissed Julian when I first met him, back when both of us were long-haired and bespectacled. )	I deliver another order, to the already-open door of yet another curiously-lit, small-scale, drunken co-ed hang out. “Come in! I won’t kill you. I promise,” says a guy who is holding a knife precisely as one does when one just wants to be a dick to the delivery guy. I hesitate briefly, but of course, I know that a certain percentage of the college students who call out for delivery on Friday and Saturday nights will just be like this, wannabe-alpha whitebread dullard types. Perhaps another driver would bother to be assertive and say, “Put the knife down, please”—a pretty basic request to make before entering a stranger’s residence—but there’s a big screen TV blasting “Brass Monkey” by the Beastie Boys, for chrissakes, and a pantsless girl with heavy eye makeup on the couch vaguely watching over her shoulder, and other guys with crew cuts wandering around, holding Budweiser beers in their hands, stumbling about and looking like they’re trying to remember what they were stumbling around trying to find. 	The third delivery to this apartment complex is to a unit whose lights are on, although repeated knocking and calling on the phone leads to no response. “Hey,” say a couple of girls who are passing by, “Can we pay you for that pizza you couldn’t deliver?” This is a question that I get asked nightly. The only thing more novel and awesome to a college-aged partier than the thought of buying someone else’s food off the pizza guy is the thought of paying to get a ride home from the pizza guy (another frequent request). I always say no in both situations… but in this case I know that it’s too late, the store is closing, no one’s taking this order back out here. Whoever placed the order is, I’m sure, either asleep or naked or no longer in the location from which they ordered their pizza. But if someone else will actually pay cash for the pizza, that’s an actual chance for a tip. So I tell the girls yes and they say great! Can I just wait like thirty seconds? Their money is inside. I politely say sure. I see, then, that they’re waiting outside of a door, in the lightly drizzling rain, for their friend to come and let them inside. Quickly and with disarming effectiveness they initiate small talk with me. One of them is from Philadelphia; we talk about that city. After about two minutes I say that I have one more delivery at Puffton Village to make, and then I’ll be right back… 	The fourth delivery is also unremarkable. 	I drive back to where the girls are still standing. “Can we wait in your car?” I’m immediately asked, but as their friend still has not arrived, I tell them that I need to deliver this one more order to another, nearby apartment complex. “Do you want me to come back after I do that?” They say yes. 	The delivery to the other apartment complex goes quickly. 	Driving back to the girls, I feel a bit dumb. Going over a bunch of speed bumps, slightly out of my way. But it really is, I know, my last chance of the night to make a bit more money. 	But, nope. I get there and they say they’ve already called in a new order for themselves; they called just in time to be able to still get something delivered. 	“All right,” I say. 	Tomorrow is going to be my last night of the year working at that pizza place. The store will have more hours for me when the new semester starts in mid-January. 29	I’m sitting with Harry for Friday night karaoke. He tells me he called me out of work today because he needs cheering up. He’s feeling really affected by the elementary school shootings that happened this morning in Newtown, Connecticut. 	Alix, although she has been texting me since the early evening about the possibility of doing something tonight, and although she left open the possibility that she might show up here, has not materialized. 	Before long, Harry has asked, “Would you like to step outside?” and I’ve agreed. We’re talking about philosophies of government. It’s below freezing outside, but still not so cold that we’re rushing to get into a car. He has mentioned going to Local Burger, although I don’t really care for that place. I offer to drive us there… 	…where, as I shovel french fries into my mouth, I am maybe a bit rude for asking him when he plans to get out of this small town life. He says he’s got some good things going for him, including a type of work he enjoys and the part of Judas in an area production of Jesus Christ Superstar. He had talked earlier in the night about living with his mother, and I had quipped, “Oh, but you could be doing a lot worse. Anyway, ‘not being in jail’ is the new ‘owning a home’. ” 30	Rosalyn comes back. After driving her past where she’ll be working (in Agawam) I drive us down to West Hartford, Connecticut, to the Elbow Room—a restaurant Esther took me to once. 	The next day I drive around and pick out presents for my cousins’ kids. Konner, Emma, Evan. My uncle Bill’s daughter, Ashley, is due to have her first kid soon, so that’ll probably be right around the Christmas holiday. I already got my gift for Rosalyn. 31	Dec. 27, 4 AM. Just waking up… but that’s not a huge shock. I’m sick. I lay down on Christmas at about 5 in the afternoon and have mostly been sleeping ever since. I have a sore throat, but “sore” doesn’t really explain it well. It’s a mucousy thing that I’m experiencing, along with a disinclination toward movement in general. Rosalyn is feeling unwell now, too, but she seems to be about a day behind me in the course of the sickness. So I have a feeling that today will be the really bad day for her, just as yesterday was the really bad day for me. 	I believe it was Christmas Eve when she said she was going to take a turn doing the dishes. But I’m awake, and the dishes are the big, glaring thing begging to be done in the apartment. I’m not working at all, while she has just started a new job and has been getting her things organized, so it makes sense that I’ve been doing the basic cleaning of the place. I get the faucet to an appropriate temperature and listen to podcasts (Sex Nerd Sandra, Slate Culture Gabfest) and have at the silverware, cups, bowls, and dishes. 	Happy having her here, having long conversations with her. We agree that everything we’ve ever had in common with anyone else, it seems, we don’t have in common with each other, while the things we do have in common with each other we’ve never had in common with anyone else. 	I’ve been surprised by some things. Surprised to find myself waking her up early in the morning—a difficult task involving multiple alarms, plus me poking her and talking to her, plus Kaylee licking her face. Surprised to find her carelessly leaving the oven on overnight… leaving hot water boiling for her tea while she gets in the shower or takes the dog out. For my part, I’ve already proven the hazards of sharing a living space with me, by stepping on and breaking more than one important belonging of hers…	…but those occasions couldn’t surprise me, because I already was aware of my tendency to stomp around my home space with little caution. I think I expected only to find her more competent than me in everyday ways. She is educating me in things like cooking and medicine and skin care… but I also am beginning to form in my mind a story about who she is… 	…having an attention deficit, which I didn’t really see until recently…	…compensated for, she has said, by a dedication to order and rules…	…and I told her about how, in studying for the final in my psych class, the section on obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in the book I was reading had seemed to describe her…	…including the part that described people with that personality disorder as being particularly susceptible to depression starting later in life. And she said yes and used that as an opportunity to start talking about depression in her family. 	And now I’m still sick, sucking on Atomic Fire Balls that my aunt Kim gave as a gift harkening back to my younger years, when I would frequently and with great delight receive similar giant containers of the candy. As a happy coincidence, having candy to suck on is beneficial right now, given my sickness. 	Being sick makes me think of death, and death makes think about how I don’t have the sudden occasions of fear about impending death—panic attacks and whatever—I sometimes got while still a cigarette smoker.

    "body": "32 Rosalyn keeps saying that she thinks I wouldn’t have this deeply-rooted feeling of otherness if I had been born and raised in a place like where she grew up. 33 I routinely bring her breakfast and tea in bed, and I pack lunches for her to take to work. 34 I don’t like being pushed or coerced into doing something. It comes up at one moment when Rosalyn, who has not done dishes since moving in, wants me to do the dishes (which I have been doing on a daily basis) within an hour of my waking up—for reasons I never figure out. 35 While I’m sick it only feels like I am spending all my time doing dishes. In fact, I am also spending large amounts of time organizing my possessions, in particular my old VHS tapes and my music collection. Also, cuddling on the couch with Rosalyn and Kaylee. 36 Rosalyn expresses interest in seeing the home movies I have found of myself as a teenager, so I show them to her. “You’re a surprise ending,” she says to me, not for the first time, about how good my prospects in life seem to her now, despite the meandering way I got to where I am now. “We don’t know that yet, though,” I protest. “It’s not the ending yet. But thank you for believing in me. ” 37 Me, fifteen minutes after trying to make a pun: “But, seriously. You didn’t think ‘papi Cthulhu’ was funny at all?” 38 And New Year’s Eve, oh, New Year’s Eve. Rosalyn and I headed to Easthampton and found Popcorn Noir, a place I had not yet visited, which is half a restaurant and half an independent movie theater run on some sort of membership system. I had been a little frustrated (or maybe the more appropriate word would just be “saddened”) when Salma, who had excited me by saying that she would be going to the Primate Fiasco/And The Kids event inside at the Hotel Northampton, mentioned that she wanted to come here before heading to Northampton. That plan saddened me because leaving at 10 or 11 and then trying to park on New Year’s Eve in Northampton sounded less than fun. And when, at the time, Rosalyn had said that she would not be willing to pay for a ticket for herself, even at a price of ten dollars… …I had just thrown my hands up and been like, all right, so New Year’s Eve is canceled, then. But Rosalyn later discovered that she had been paid earlier than expected. (I’m disoriented by how unpredictable it is, what she will think is within her budget on any given day. This may be associated with the difficulty she has always had with mathematics? She will go out and spend two hundred dollars on groceries one day, without showing any awareness that this is an expensive shopping trip. Then she will say that she is not willing to go out anywhere if she will need to spend anything at all. ) But tickets were sold out by that time, so we did not have tickets. The people at Popcorn Noir did not seem thrilled by the fact that a group of us was converging in their establishment with the intention to go elsewhere. They had previously been nice to us, though, and when Rosalyn inquired about the unmarked, homemade-alcohol-looking glass containers behind the bar at which we sat we were informed of the different spicy drinks they made there. “Here, try this,” Salma said to me, sliding a shot glass over while I talked with Rosalyn. “Okay. ” “I should probably mention that it’s a very, very spicy alcohol. Do you want to try it?” The hostess jumped in, without missing a beat: “Do it!” “I will!” I said, and so I finished the last sip of the ghost pepper vodka. I got bummed out as the time passed by and everyone was trying to figure out the logistics of who would be driving whom and when and to where. And Alix hadn’t shown up… but the last Salma had heard from her, Alix was saying that she would be getting to Popcorn Noir at some hour that was actually later than Salma was planning to stay at Popcorn Noir? And meanwhile, Stephanie and Brandon were intending to be at La Veracruzana, a Mexican restaurant on Main Street in Northampton, where a Latin funk/Andean/jazz-pop band was playing? There were just too many variables being too poorly considered. I didn’t want to spend my New Year’s Eve trying to get from one place to another, failing to rendezvous with people, and so on. I told Rosalyn that I’d like to get going, that I didn’t think the night would go well if we tried to tag along to Northampton. She explained to Salma, then, that we would be leaving due to our feeling too sick and sleepy; this threw me off, since that was not our reason for leaving at all, and when I mentioned it later she even started saying, “Well, I am tired, and we are feeling sick. ” It would never have occurred to me to tell my friend a white lie like that. And for a small handful of hours, another half-sleep. Because that was just how it was going: me sleeping more or less from midnight to four every night, then noon to four every day. And in the morning, bringing her breakfast in bed, and sometimes packing her a lunch. And in the evening, doing dishes. 39 Jan. 1, 2013. A drive with Rosalyn taken mostly to pick up my paycheck (from a couple of weeks ago) at Domino’s in Amherst. Lara, the manager, is there, talking to a driver she is hiring about when he can start. The odds are probably higher than you would expect that I should walk in on the hiring of a new driver: not only is the turnover rate very high, but it takes a large number of drivers to handle the busier shifts at this location. More than a dozen drivers might be on at once on a Friday or Saturday night, with a typical delivery involving 3 or 4 deliveries transported in the car per run. I mention that I’m available during the winter break to work any shifts for which I might be needed. She seems pleased by this. 40 Thirsty Mind, South Hadley, Massachusetts. At one of the window seats, looking down a sloped roof to the building where the Tower Theaters are. Rosalyn sitting across from me. Somebody’s cell phone playing a jangly ringtone. Rosalyn got hot chocolate. I got a chai tea latte. She’s reading a hardcover copy of one of the volumes of my Life Story. Back when the two of us were still living in Pennsylvania I sent her everything up to the part she’s reading now (my move to Washington state) in Kindle format. Although she has been asking me all along to send her the parts she has not yet read, only today did it occur to me that I could just hand her the physical copy and allow her to read it that way. “It’s almost a shame,” she said as she held on to the book a few hours ago, as we stood in the kitchen and prepared to step out into the cold. “That you’re not interested in having children. Because, think how awesome that would be, for a son or daughter to have all that narrative. ” I nodded. “I’ve thought about that, too. Well, hopefully there’ll be other younger people around—children of friends, that sort of thing. ” Now, here inside this coffee shop across from Mount Holyoke College—(“Cute,” she said upon stepping into it)—she occasionally laughs out loud, which prompts me either to peek over her shoulder or to smile and look at her until she volunteers information about what part she is at. We went out last night to Packards with Salma plus Eric, the guy she is starting to date. Eric bought us a round and talked about politics. He and Rosalyn were the most active in the conversation; I was the next most active; Salma was the least active. Salma texted me to say that she felt uninformed about the topics at hand. Then we moved on to Hugo’s. More conversation. Then back home. And the usual. Walk up the stairs. Reheat some leftover breakfast potatoes. Take the dog out; watch her leap adorably through the snow. Get to bed. And I wake up early and go to the gym. 41 I finally figured out that the treadmills at the Planet Fitness locations I’ve been going to—(I signed up in Langhorne, Pennsylvania for a membership that lets me work out at any location)—are designed so that books can easily be set up on the machines and read. I already have found myself in a comfortable routine of exercising every day, so this revelation can only help me as I try to keep it up. 42 It is not quite official—I still need to get to touch with the people who handle fieldwork placements for the Bay Path OT program—but I have both budgeted for and discussed with Rosalyn my idea of doing both of my level 2 placements in the greater D. C. area. This arrangement would have me departing for points south about one year from now. I would then be down there—living in Maryland, probably, and hopefully benefiting from affordable lodging thanks to Rosalyn’s connections in the area—from January through the end of June. The ambitious element would be my taking one class in the Writing program from which I never graduated, at Johns Hopkins University, from about the end of January 2014 through the beginning of May 2014. Meanwhile, Rosalyn is looking to begin in an OT program in the fall of 2014, which would coincide (knock on wood) with my graduating, taking my certification exam, and entering the workforce. 43 I was going to write something more, but Kaylee, who has seemed a bit under the weather today since throwing up in the AM, just wants to cuddle. Aw. The cute cuddly puppy wins. 44 Rosalyn: “I don’t know if my aunts are so enthusiastic because they like you, or just because there’s finally someone I might marry in my life. ” 45 Rosalyn and I go to a party at Salma’s place. We bring the last of the bottle of homemade mead that she got through her brother. Most of the party seems to pass with Rosalyn and I standing in the kitchen, with roommates and others coming and going, while Salma takes command of food, making a flatbread with some sort of filling inside it—a variation of something I saw her make once before, only that other time the filling was chickpea, and this time… I forget what the filling was. Salma’s longtime friend, Sarah W. , is there, and so is her daughter. “I did not even entertain the possibility that that was your daughter,” I say. “She’s so big!” And yes, Alix and Flip come, too, typically and fashionably late. It’s a pleasant night. I once again benefit from Rosalyn’s abstaining from alcohol, with her being my designated driver. 46 “What about your life right now are you most pleased with?” asked Rosalyn, the other night. “Your companionship,” I replied. “The ongoing conversation I get to have with you. ” Yet, after we went to see Wreck-It Ralph at the Garden Cinemas in Greenfield, after she mentioned that I had seemed to enjoy the movie, having while watching it a “sphinx-like smile” on my face, I said to her, “Yeah, you seem to watch me a lot when we’re watching a movie. Why is that?” “I want to see if you’re enjoying yourself. You don’t laugh. ” “It kind of makes me anxious, being watched. ” And that was true. I become anxious when someone is heavily concerned about how I look to be feeling. Experience tells me that what they see when they watch my expression will not quite match how I am actually feeling. If someone wants to know, it’s better that they ask. 47 Before seeing the movie in Greenfield, we stopped at a restaurant—I actually kind of liked the place, which was very empty on this January evening, even though we were only getting burgers and not trying their more interesting entrees. I provoked Rosalyn with a big question or two—easy enough to do, as she can be set off and will talk for a long time, not only in response to personal or emotional topics but in response to questions like, you know, “What spice is this?” or “Why does my stomach make these sounds?” And she was saying that she was glad to be with someone who could accept things like the possibility of us being apart for lengths of time due to her pursuit of her own career and interests (for example, if she decided to attend any of several distant-from-where-I-would-be-at-the-time educational programs she has talked about). I replied that actually, I was more concerned that in the long run I might want to spend chunks of time away doing crazy, ambitious, or adventurous things, and that she might find herself frustrated by that. Which thought I think she held on to, since she later (after we had seen that Greenfield Coffee was closed, and after we had instead purchased two coffees from a convenience store on Main Street, and as we sat, parked, in my car, undisturbed in the middle of an underpopulated downtown) brought up something I had forgotten, but which, once she said it again, I knew she had said before: “I think that as a general rule it’s fair to say, if something would keep us away for longer than a year we ask the other partner, and if it would be less than a year, we tell. ” 48 On a snowy Tuesday morning, with the syllabi for all but one of my classes now available, I take a trip to the Bay Path campus to print things out. In the sixty to ninety minutes I spend inside the small library, with the familiar face of the reference librarian seated at her station, I only see one other student. Then I drive about to replenish my famotidine (stomach acid reducer) and to purchase the couple of things I feel I will need when classes start up next week (some folders and pens). 49 I’m doing dishes, waiting for a frozen pizza to cook in the oven. Then I look over and see flames. I don’t immediately know what to do without a fire extinguisher; because of my fire training from work in residential facilities, my instinct is to be sure everyone in the house is in a position to exit safely. I turn off the oven, close the doors to the other rooms—(the idea behind this being to slow the spread of flames, should a large fire ensue)—and then I run downstairs, exclaiming that there’s a fire in the oven. As it happens, Bruce and Bill have temporarily left the house, so only my mother is downstairs. “You left Kaylee there?” she says, running. “Well, yeah,” I say, thinking it obvious that finding and carrying a pet should be a lower priority in an emergency than making sure all the humans in the house are safe. The two of us hurry up the stairs. She takes the lead in the kitchen, looks in the oven, sees how small the grease fire is, and puts it out by wetting a towel. “Something that small, you can just smother it,” she says. “Oh,” I say. Then she shows me where the fire extinguisher is. 50 Rosalyn says she is trying to decide for sure whether she wants to give Colleen the expensive old dresser she inherited from her great-grandmother. “Furniture just isn’t made out of these materials anymore. ” She is talking at length about this. I want to be supportive, but I also don’t want to sway her. The conversation turns into one about her expectations in life—how she always thought that she would live a life of professional success, a steady and routine life, a big home, lots of possessions. She says that giving away that dresser is probably the best thing, since she no longer believes it can fit in with the lifestyle that is best for her. “Colleen is the one who is on the path to that lifestyle. ” “I hope you know that you can still have that other lifestyle if you want it,” I say. “And I hope you don’t give away that dresser until you’re sure about that lifestyle question. And if you are sure that you want a different life from the one what was expected of you, I hope you don’t feel ashamed about it. If it really is best for you, then it can’t be trading down; it can only be trading up. ” 51 I made pizza from scratch. Now I’m watching The Waltons. 52 On January 29 I go with Rosalyn to Haven at Diva’s. She starts off tentative about it all, but I bring the fun by playing with balloons—just like I used to do, bouncing them off my fingers and knees. Tina comes up, with short hair, gives me a hug, asks if I’m in the area. I say that yes, I am living in Chicopee with my girlfriend, Rosalyn, here. But Tina is quick to walk away, as has been the case for many years now. “That was the Tina?” Rosalyn asks. “Yes, it was!” I reply—enthusiastically, actually, because I’m a little fascinated by the phenomenon of Rosalyn’s having entered my life and read through (most of) my Life Story prior to stepping into my old western Massachusetts stomping grounds. She has herself seemed fascinated by this, by seeing the places I have written about so many times. Even tonight, she has seemed to take some pleasure from standing with me at the edge of the dance floor in a dark room filled with strobe lights and loud, dynamic music, and from observing the people dressed, some in vinyl, some in leather, some in costume, most in black. “Go ahead, anthropologist,” I have said to her, referencing her undergraduate major… and she has found it particularly notable how, in this goth club setting, the women dance unmolested, and the men actually dance on their own. We end up sitting at the bar, me drinking beers, she drinking nothing. Talking, in fact, about the Life Story. She says that it’s the sort of thing future historians would love to have. She acknowledges that my lack of plans to have kids sort of complicates the idea of passing it down through time. Yeah, I say. I might have to do something the world would be interested in first before anyone would bother to preserve these words for a hypothetical doctoral candidate to one day dig up. Well, she says, An estate doesn’t have to be something managed by offspring. An estate is just a legal entity. She says I could probably find to a way to set up my will such that my Life Story would be donated somewhere at a time when it would be likely to have perceived value. “Ha,” I say. “These are ideas. Maybe I really should try to come up with inventive schemes to have my creations survive me. ” 53 Out in Northampton working on assignments for school. Actually quite overtired, but I dial up Salma on a whim, just to see if maybe by chance she is in town and would want to have a quick bite to eat together—kind of a long shot. The call is disconnected as soon as it goes through. I figure this is probably an accident, but just in case I have reached her at a bad time I don’t call back. I walk to Bueno y Sano from the Haymarket Café to go grab a burrito. And in walks Salma! Who not only was coincidentally in town, but coincidentally had phoned in an order from the very same food place where I was waiting for my food. So, over our quick food, we talked about various things, then: her uncle, who has been sick and whom she has been visiting on the weekends; Eric, the guy she is seeing; Rosalyn; Beyoncé. A happy coincidence. "

    "body": "54 When I get home for the night, I still haven’t finished the assignment that was due the next morning. I’m too tired to feel up to working on it, though… so, not long after getting back there and having a brief chat with Rosalyn, I just get myself to bed, super-early. It is probably about 8:30 at night when this happens. And then I am awake again at about 1:30, right around the time Rosalyn joins me in bed. And I’m awake from then on, and I get my paper (or the section of the longer paper, rather) completed. I turn the paper in, sit sleepily through a lecture, drive home, sleep for a few hours, wake up, study for a quiz, drive back to Longmeadow, take a quiz, sit sleepily through a (helpfully short, in this case) lecture. Then I drive to Northampton and walk into the Haymarket, since I have a research paper to begin that is due Monday… but Rosalyn calls just in time to pre-empt my purchase of dinner (which was going to be a tempeh burger from there at Haymarket) and she offers to pay for us to get Thai food. I still think I might before we get Thai at least find some articles that I will be able to use for my paper, but no. Actually, I am pleasantly interrupted by Alix, who is there and planning to get some work done for the owners of the Haymarket itself, actually, since she got the job of redesigning their web site. She sits at my table and we catch up on the news in each other’s lives. She says she worked out some things with Flip: they will be moving back into Northampton from Leeds, and they will also, despite Alix’s general reservations about the idea, be getting a cat. Rosalyn comes in, and then, by the time hellos have been said, Salma has happened to walk in. She asks if we have seen Anne, whom she was supposed to meet, but we haven’t. Then Rosalyn is talking to Salma, trying to arrange for the two of them to meet up, and then it’s Rosalyn talking about exercises that Salma might do related to aches and pains she has been having. Then Flip walks in. Then Anne shows up, having mistaken the time she was supposed to meet Salma. Eventually the coincidentally assembled crowd splits off into smaller groups. Rosalyn remarks that the only time she can remember being able to happen upon people like this was in younger days at the shopping mall in Columbia, Maryland. She and I go to Thai Garden. One thing I will say about us is that when we sit ourselves down at a table we can always find conversation. I find myself worrying about this weekend, and how I will get my paper completed before Monday. I am as usual scheduled to work the following night, and it is forecast that we will be facing a super-mega-ultra-blizzard. I sleep and I awake and the snow has begun in the morning, but is only a dusting when (after I have assisted Rosalyn in getting up for her early start to her shift and then I have gone back to sleep with Kaylee resting in my armpit) I take the dog out and then wander casually into the downstairs, as I commonly do, and walk into the room where my mother tends to do her work—work being for her, now, data entry for the real estate business my cousin Amy and her husband have down in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia. And she says no way am I driving around and delivering pizzas through what this blizzard is expected to be, and I shrug and say we’ll see. Talking to Rosalyn at Thai Garden, I said, “If we had to buy tickets that determined how and where we were born, I think the tickets to be born in the United States in 1981 would be at a premium. ” She said that yes, she thinks ours was sort of a sweet spot, along with a certain group of “baby boomers” who came of age in the 1960s and inherited en masse a secure, middle class adult existence before then seeing home values skyrocket and being able to retire and receive the sort of pensions only a small percentage among our generation will receive. I responded by saying that I thought a lot of people in our age cohort in the U. S. were having a rather rough go at this thing called life (having expected so much more than most of us now get) but that so far I seem to have lucked out, being suited to my times enough to be living an interesting and circuitous but perhaps actually, so it now is seeming, perhaps overall pretty happy and fortunate and exciting life. Without the Internet coming along for me when it did, my loneliness and social awkwardness might have really devastated my psyche in a permanent and debilitating way. In another age or place, my giving up on school—repeatedly—would have closed many of the doors I have since decided to try going through. I wouldn’t have had access to the information that allows me to have things in common with someone like Rosalyn. And I went on and on about that. But anyway. I drive around and purchase some things. Governor Deval Patrick declares that not only is the entire commonwealth in a state of emergency, but vehicles are not allowed on the roads at all—an action that is too authoritarian for my tastes but convenient in that it means I am certain not to have to deliver pizzas from midnight to five in the morning through the worst of a blizzard. I nap and Rosalyn comes home and I am still hopeful that I might hide in the spare room/office, which I never use, but then Rosalyn is asking to cuddle, and since I feel myself getting pulled away from the all-work-and-no-play mindset that I know I must keep in order to focus and get going on something like this, I say no and walk away, but then a few minutes later ask her how she’s doing because I know that I snapped at her, and I ask her if she wants to talk, but really it seems like it’s I who wants to talk, and I talk to her about how her coming up and touching me when I’m not expecting it makes me feel unsafe. And she cries and then we cuddle and talk more for a while. We watch The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which I am late in returning to the Bay Path College library, and then we go for a walk through the blizzard, which is just starting to pick up and has dropped, it seems, a little over a foot of snow so far. Rosalyn makes snow angels in the street. We go back inside and she begins to fade away toward sleep while I am next to her in the bed with my laptop, uploading our pictures of midnight blizzard walking to Facebook. And when will I be writing that freaking research paper? 55 “I had an experience of instant karma on that run,” one of my fellow Domino’s drivers says to Lara, the manager. “I make the delivery to a girl at UMass. She signs the credit card slip, tips me nothing. Then she takes four steps, slips, and falls. ” Everyone within earshot laughs. Except for me, because I’m like that. 56 It’s a very slow shift, and the tips are meager as well. At the end of the night, as I stand in the (illegally) smoke-filled back office, waiting to hand over my money, Lara is saying to a customer on the phone, “You told the driver that you would be there in five minutes. He left, probably, because he was freezing and because it’s 4:30 in the morning and he’s eager to get home. ” Soon she is hanging up the phone, but she continues talking as though the customer were there to listen to the venting of her anger. She has choice words to say in general about Amherst College and Hampshire College students and “their trust funds”. The customer, a Hampshire College student, calls again. She hangs up on him. He calls again, and she hangs up on him again. Then, because the technology she is using just happens to allow for it, she is listening to what the customer is saying while he thinks he is just on hold. He is talking to whomever he is with at the other end of the line, saying that he has worked in a pizza shop before and that behaving toward a customer the way the woman on the phone had done was the sort of thing that would get someone fired. The situation fizzles out. Eventually my money is taken. “I’ll see you the week after next,” I say to Lara, because next weekend is a long weekend, when many students will be away. Then I go to the Whately Diner to do that paper and my other assignments for school. 57 I wake up at two in the afternoon. Rosalyn says she’s having a bad morning. She misses being able to see her friends, she says. We end up in a conversation about how she is feeling, which turns into a conversation about her and our plans, about her schooling and such. Her father has made clear that she is to look at two-year OT programs, not three-year ones, thus ruling out the option of Towson University. It may turn out that, assuming she gets accepted into it, she can sell her father on the one-day-per-week-residency program at Shenandoah University, which would enable our ideas about living together in Maryland while I take classes at Johns Hopkins to work out. Or she might end up in a program up here in Massachusetts. Or who knows. She would like to get back to Maryland, she says, at least for a bit. One thing that strikes me about our conversation, which we have in the living room while my first caffeine of the day wakes me up, is the large portion of it that revolves around her self-confidence, or her lack of it. While accepting that I do not have experience facing strict expectations from family—my family has a more laissez faire attitude about what I do in life, Rosalyn would say, and I would let this characterization slide—I tell her that my emotional strategy to avoid dwelling on how others view me and my endeavors is to look ahead, focusing on what I know that the people looking from the outside do not. I think about how great the next thing I do will be. Rosalyn seems to approve of this strategy, but she also says that she isn’t sure what she is doing is the right thing. She says that intellectually, it seems it should make sense… that no matter what, she should be able to have both a comfortable and a meaningful life being either a physical therapist or an occupational therapist. But, she adds, the plans she made at an earlier point in her life made sense, too, before she was hit by a bus. “One thing I think is dangerous,” I tell her, “Is to make your goals in life about how you feel. It’s so hard to measure your success, then. If your goal is to “feel better” or to to “be happier” it falls on you to decide whether you do feel better or happier. It’s easy to sabotage yourself. ” In the past she has said to me that one remarkable thing about me as a partner is that I (like Chris) break the pattern of her previous relationships, in which she tended to have to take care of people who were unable to effectively take care of themselves, especially because of depression. It’s clear, I am seeing, that if there is a “depressed one” in our relationship, she is that depressed one. 58 Due to slipperiness—and very much to my benefit, since I was planning to wake up after like two hours of sleep to finish my research paper—my Monday classes are canceled. Rosalyn calls out of work. I sleep late, then drive from coffee shop to coffee shop, doing school work. I try to fall asleep that night with her and Kaylee, but I am not successful. Thanks to some sleeplessness-inspired Google search or other, I stumble somehow upon the archives of PVGoth (the Pioneer Valley Gothlist). Although I was not active on it, I know almost everyone whose posts I find myself reading through in these archives, which span from 2003 to the final closing down of the mailing list in 2010. As time passes, the opinions people were so eager to express on that list—opinions about clubgoing and netiquette and whatever else—are less and less of interest to anyone. I would love for time to show that what I write down for myself here—what I write in my Life Story—is less ephemeral than that. I would love for my words to be of interest to people in the future. But even if I do ultimately achieve that—(and stranger things have happened)—these words too will at some point be unworthy of memory. And at a still later date, everything that you and I have in common—our shared humanity—will be completely obsolete. 59 Rosalyn is packed and ready for a weekend away. I go to Northampton, sit at the Haymarket Café, and work on the lit review section of my big paper on self-efficacy and religiosity. Rosalyn calls, saying that one of her headlights is out and that she is worried about being pulled over. My first thought is that the odds of her being pulled over are low, but I also know that Rosalyn is not the sort of person to ask for help with something unless she has thought the situation through and has determined that she really needs the help. Indeed, when I meet her back in Chicopee she tells me that she was pulled over already, just in the twenty minute drive from Agawam. She says she has bad luck with these things and that having an out-of-state plate and driving a BMW only attracts more attention from cops. So I drive her down to Westport, Connecticut. Then, instead of taking the same boring route I took to get to Westport, I choose to drive north along winding, deep-forest back roads, knowing that this will lead me to I-84, which will lead me to Hartford, which will lead me back to Massachusetts. Just before I get back on the highway, I stop at a diner for what I decide will be the second half of my dinner. “One scrambled egg and bacon,” I request from the rough-voiced waitress. “Really? Just one egg?” “Well, I’m not looking for a lot of food. I think mostly what I want is the bacon. ” “Why don’t you get a sandwich, then? A bacon and egg sandwich—do you want that?” “Um. Well…” “It’s up to you. ” “Actually, I think I’d just like the egg and bacon. That comes with potatoes and toast, right?” It does. After she has walked away, I realize that I have forgotten to ask for coffee. The next time I see her, though, she is already bringing me my order. I’m surprised by the quick arrival: “Oh, great!” I say. She drops the plate and turns away in one quick motion. “‘Kay. Enjoy. ” So, no coffee for me. Looking around, it’s obvious that something serious happened in this town recently. There are wristbands for sale behind the counter at this diner. Paper placemats are taped up in its front window, decorated with messages of support from out-of-state children. “We are Sandy Hook/We choose love” is the message on a simple piece of 8 ½” by 11” paper in the window of the door of the convenience store next door. Out of this door bounces a college-aged woman. She is saying, “I saw a dime on the ground!” and then: “I found it!” She runs back inside, tosses the coin onto the counter, then exits with whatever she was buying. I walk in. The light is convenience store light. The cups are convenience store cups. The “We’re with you, Newtown” banner sent from citizens in Tucson hangs from an overpass in the night, lit up by my headlights. 60 And back in Chicopee, Massachusetts, with the place all to myself, I bounce my head and flap my hands repeatedly. Which always makes the dog nervous at first, until she gets used to it. 61 Of course I love you, 3 AM. I just think we should spend some time apart, do some soul-searching, see if this relationship is really what each of us is looking for. 62 “Well-being was also found in general to be negatively correlated with searches for meaning in life (p&lt;. 01),” says my research. I’m sitting at the Haymarket Café again. I was here last night, along with (just by coincidence) Alix and Flip. Only, Alix left our table downstairs to speak with a guy upstairs—someone who is always around, who has always been around—about a web design project. And Flip was falling asleep in his chair next to me while poking at online things using his e-book reader. Then I drove to Amherst. Walking by Stackers—one of the college bars on Pleasant Street near the Starbucks—I saw Chris Bigelow, the Cloud 9 Productions karaoke DJ, who waved to me through the window as he DJ’d. Then I was at Starbucks until it closed, at midnight. Then I drove home, where Rosalyn was struggling to stay awake for me. Then I sat at the counter in the kitchen, working on the literature review for my paper, while she slept. I kept in front of me a single beer, the only one I drank that night—a single beer in the nighttime having become a fairly typical thing for me—and I made steady progress, while finding my body unprepared to sleep. Then, in the morning, I set my alarm for the time when Rosalyn had to be sure to wake up. 63 My stomach feels slightly unwell when I get home in the evening. “What did you eat today?” Rosalyn asks, and I tell her: “A bagel with neufchâtel cheese, then chicken fingers and white rice from the Longmeadow Hu Ke Lau Restaurant. From that point on I wasn’t feeling too well. Then I had a lot of coffee and one oatmeal raisin cookie. ” She rubs my abdomen as the two of us lie on the loveseat and as Kaylee comes back repeatedly with a little toy of hers so that I’ll throw it. 64 “It’s tricky to wocka rhyme, to wocka rhyme that’s right on time. Wocka, wocka, wocka!” -Fozz DMC 65 “Rosalyn? It’s time to get up. It’s 7:55. I don’t know why your alarm didn’t go off ten minutes ago. Me, I’m going to try to lie down until I have to leave at 8:30. There’s American optimism for you: ‘30 minutes left—I can still get some sleep!’” Several minutes later, she is still in bed, with me next to her. But she is stretching, at least. “Ugh,” she says. “Thirty-five years left. ” I don’t understand at first: “What?” “Thirty-five more years of doing this. ” 66 I wake up at three o’clock in the morning on the first day in March, 2013 in Chicopee, Massachusetts. We’re out of coffee, so I drive to the 7-11. Changing some of the coffees while talking to a friend is the guy whose first nights working there I remember. He seemed enthused, back then, some months prior, and initiated a conversation with me about the band Tool. Now he is growing out a thick beard and seems to have adjusted more to the typical role of an overnight store worker. Waving a half-smoked cigarette around between his fingers, he tells his friend a story about some ridiculous interaction with a customer. I swipe my debit card to pay for my coffee; if I use my Florence Savings Bank account to pay for a certain number of transactions in a given thirty-day period I earn a respectable interest rate on the balance in my checking account. I stop by an ATM to take out the money I have budgeted for the coming week. Then I drive to Walgreen’s to buy twelve ounces of coffee grounds. Then I drive away. It’s always dark in Massachusetts. The roads are curved and full of pot holes. The trees are always being pulled down. 67 At the Domino’s in Amherst, I’m back for another super-late-night weekend shift delivering pizzas. Inside, Pavel advises someone who is going to Puffton Village Apartments: “Lock up your car there. It’s a big clusterfuck at Puffton tonight. The kids are going crazy. ” “I always lock my car if it’s going to be out of eyesight,” I say. The driver he was talking to says, “I should set up the redneck car security system. ” “What’s that?” asks Pavel. “Running a wire from the car battery to the handle. It always feels good when you get someone with that. It’s like getting someone with a low-level taser. ” Pavel leaves with the latest orders he has to deliver. The other driver starts talking to the guy working the oven. They trade stories about mean-spirited surprises they’ve given people they didn’t like. 68 After initially heading back to Chicopee following the end of my shift, I end up in Northampton, at the Starbucks there for a while, beginning the treatment plan that will be due the next day. I drive back to Chicopee and find that Rosalyn is still awake. Kaylee barks at me whenever I enter the room where her mommy is sleeping. Although Kaylee is really fond of and protective of me, too, this is typical. After Rosalyn is awake I take my turn at sleep. I am pleasantly surprised to find that I sleep as late as I hope to, then: I get up sometime in the evening, like at seven o’clock or something. Just as I’m trying to pull myself out of bed, I hear Rosalyn going downstairs. I try to yell after her, but she doesn’t hear. She is downstairs for a bit before I get a text message from my mom, saying that she got Chinese food and that I should go downstairs if I’d like some. So I end up there, sitting at the table. Bruce is in the living room chair, where he always sits, in front of the large-screen television. But Rosalyn, who has gone downstairs to do some laundry, is apparently caught up in conversation with my uncle Bill and… his friend? So I actually go upstairs, make coffee, and am about to get in the shower to get ready to go before she comes up. She says that she was down there answering questions about natural remedies. I suggest to her that since she her plans for the night include further research on her own OT school options, maybe we should go together to study in the coffee shop that I know will be open until midnight, the Starbucks in Amherst. She says yes to this. After a car ride and a stop for some frozen yogurt we get to the Starbucks, only to find that there is no more than one open seat there. We ride back home, then. I’m bummed out by the frustration of my plans and nap for like an hour. Then I sit in front of the computer at the counter in the kitchen. Rosalyn is at her usual place in the living room. Eventually, when Rosalyn goes to bed, I drive south to begin my day of school assignments followed by classes. "

On Wednesday, when I’m out at Haymarket and working on a big assignment due by email Friday at noon, it is guilt that leads me to say yeah sure when Rosalyn calls to ask if I want to do something for dinner. Because I’ve been way distant. After waking up at 2:30 in the morning on Thursday and sitting down to write, I hear the unmistakable sounds of a small dog throwing up in the next room. I move her to the floor, pull off the blanket that now needs to be washed, reassure Rosalyn—who opens her eyes cutely and confusedly—and tuck her in with the remaining blankets. 70 Mar. 9. Waking up at oh man like half past two in the morning, knowing that it will be a long day ahead of me. The dog not in bed—when it’s I who goes to sleep before Rosalyn it is pretty much even odds whether the dog ends up in bed with us or not—and so she stretches, curiously but nervously, when in the middle of the sleepytime hours I sit down on the floor and open my computer and review the latest whatever people have put on Facebook in the past several hours. Knowing I would very much prefer not to be awake yet, I only stay at the computer for about twenty minutes, then go back to bed to try to see I can successfully get myself back to sleep. And after about ninety minutes, hurray! I am asleep again! I wake up at a more reasonable morning hour, then, along with Rosalyn. She and I pack and head north on our venture up to Burlington. We stop at Brattleboro along the way. It is a remarkably nice day for early March, and many people are out and enjoying the town center. Rosalyn and I get some coffee at Mocha Joe’s, then walk through one of those stores she enjoys looking through but I would never stop in on my own. A gal on the sidewalk sits in a chair and types at a typewriter—a public behavior I have never seen before in my life. We arrive in Burlington. Rosalyn’s brother, who in his adapted homeland of Vermont goes by the name Mack, is younger than us both, wears a leather jacket and walks with self-conscious swagger up to us. He grabs his sister into a firm hug, which turns out to be a bit too firm: “Be careful,” she says to him, reminding him of how her bones enjoy slipping out of alignment. We all go upstairs to an apartment, where he lives with roommates in the sort of nerdy/geeky college-and-post-college living space I encountered many times in my own twenties. Empty beer bottles put where they’re supposed to be. Anime posters in the bathroom. A big sort of bean-bag-ish-but-not-actually-bean-bag chair in the middle of the living room—he throws his body delightedly onto this. Soon we are leaving so that he can begin showing off his town to us. (Rosalyn has not visited him here before. ) We’re walking that walkable area at the center of town, then. We find a place for Rosalyn to get real hot chocolate—something she has been disappointed not to find anywhere in the Pioneer Valley—but the timing is off, because we already have just had ice cream, and so we decide that tomorrow will be the day for that. We head next to a German restaurant called Das Bierhaus. The waitress, who is in an over-the-top costume fitting the theme, talks casually with Mack about people the two of them know in common. Stopping back at the apartment briefly before heading to see a drag and burlesque show at The Monkey House in Winooski, I quickly manage, using Priceline on my phone, to book a hotel room for the night. Then a stop at the supermarket, which is bustling and where the people around us continue to be notably friendly, laid-back, and helpful, offering their beer suggestions and such. Mack says he was kind of hoping to start his own area burlesque night, but that then the one we are going to see was started by someone else. He wants to see what they’re doing with the idea. Eventually the music starts. A fun retro synth pop band from Rhode Island, called Magic Man, goes up. I “like” them on Facebook after they have finished performing… then I also check the web site for the bar we are all sitting in. “Hey,” I say, handing my phone to Mack. “The roster of acts tonight doesn’t mention any sort of burlesque. ” He looks, then slaps his forehead in an animated manner. “I got the date wrong!” Since the hour is late and Rosalyn and I have been up since an early hour, we and Mack part ways for the night soon after. We have lucked out: the hotel room is nice for what we’re paying. I wake up several hours too early for comfort, though, and at that point I’m immediately hungry. So, okay. A search of the surrounding area using my phone informs me that we are near an International House of Pancakes, and that it will be opening soon. And away I go! I waste time on my phone, eat pancakes, then head back to the hotel room. As soon as I lie down next to Rosalyn she wakes up. We have to get going, anyway, so we take our time with our morning ADLs, then check out and go to eat at… International House of Pancakes! Because it sounded really appealing to her and she didn’t want to go anywhere else instead. Sitting together in the now much busier restaurant, we review the previous day and talk about her relationship with her brother. Then we drive back into the town center. Man, there are some pretty views of Lake Champlain as one walks toward it. And yet, somehow, on my prior stops in this town I never noticed! We wait for Mack to join us at the aquarium. I haven’t been to an aquarium in years. Then we get hot chocolate… walk through a record store, where Mack and I try to explain to Rosalyn what the idea behind collecting records is and why it is appealing to some people—(really? She is the one who likes antiques, heirlooms, fancy old furniture, but she can’t fathom the idea of record collecting?)… get lunch at a brew pub… and decide that it’s time to head south. Rosalyn drove my car for the trip up, so I drive as we head back to Massachusetts. We listen to the new They Might Be Giants CD, Nanobots, which I picked up at a CD store in Vermont… and also to what she picked up from the same store, the soundtrack to the musical Wicked. (Note: My mention of Wicked should not be interpreted as an endorsement of it. ) I’m tired as I drive. Then we’re back in stupid Chicopee. 71 Chris comes to visit. Rosalyn goes to stay in a hotel room with him in Holyoke. That is Friday. Also on Friday, Alix texts me about going to the WWII. I am, for a change, not working, so I go. Harry is also there, along with a woman who is also in the cast of the production of Jesus Christ Superstar going up in Turners Falls, in which Harry plays Judas. The next day, as previously arranged, I have lunch with Rosalyn and Chris. In the night, it is Stephanie’s birthday, so I show up at a restaurant called Amy’s Place in Easthampton. It is just her, Brandon, Derrick, and I. We all go over to Salma’s after. Salma, whose back is still hurting from a slipped disc, with which Rosalyn has been helping her in recent times. We all play a game of Balderdash, which I win. 72 On Sunday I have to wear a sling all day as an assignment. Rosalyn says she doesn’t have money to go see a movie or anything. We go out to Target and I buy some household things, but otherwise almost the entire day is spent with me sitting by her side to give her the push and the assistance she needs to gather information about OT schools. 73 “Why do you say ‘I love you’ so much less than I do?” Rosalyn asks. I answer her, straightforwardly and without overthinking my response, that although I like exchanging “I love you”s daily, the words feel become something different to me when she says them dozens of times per day, clearly expecting and watching for a reciprocation. 74 Like winter break, spring break found me going to the gym regularly. I am again aspiring to fit gym-going into my daily routine even during the school year. So, I do that today. This plus cleaning up the apartment (mostly by doing dishes) eats up a lot of my time, and I do not get any schoolwork done. I drive east towards greater Worcester. Esther has planned for us to meet up at the TD Bank in the town of Auburn, Massachusetts, because she has seen it off the highway near where, on the way back from Boston, she will have to turn south while I continue west to get home. I know from previous attempts to map the way to a Qdoba (for which I developed a taste while in living in Center City, Philadelphia) that the closest one is in this area… so here I go! And the gal behind the counter there says, as she finishes putting together my tacos and nachos, “This all looks delicious! And some corn… and some lettuce… and a little bit of love!” And I enjoy my food. And then I go to an ATM next door, and the woman in front of me is friendly, too. Or maybe—somehow this does not occur to me—I am the one being friendly. The woman tries to get the door of the vestibule to unlock by sliding her bank card into the slot at the outside of it… but even after she seemingly has turned it every which way, there has been no click sound and no green light. “It’s only ever, like, the fifth direction you try,” I say, lightly. She smiles and says, “I just have to cash my paycheck from over there at Red Robin. ” My GPS takes me to what it says should be the Auburn TD Bank, but it’s actually an Outback Steakhouse. I call Esther, who says she’ll come and pick me up there. She calls when she gets to the parking lot. I get in the car. She doesn’t really look at me? And she looks unhappy. Partly due to work, no doubt. She zooms out of the lot in the direction of the highway, although we are not in a hurry. She and I talk about comedy, mostly, on the ride into Cambridge. In the time since I met her I have followed her example and become a comedy fan in my own right. At the top level of a Harvard Square parking garage, while Esther looks through her purse for something, I take a moment to stand and gaze out over the city. A meteor streaks across the sky in electric green. I mention this to Esther, but since she and I have been speaking in our usual jokey way, she doesn’t realize that I have really seen a falling star: she thinks I am just saying something dumb that doesn’t really make sense. We sit at Peet’s Coffee. She says she always forgets how “chain-y” Peet’s is until she goes inside and remembers that the ambiance is more like a Starbucks than like a local coffee house. She mentions that she now makes her coffee using a Chemex and that she has at times thought of me while waiting for the coffee because of how impatient I was in the morning, waiting for the water to boil so that we could pour it into her french press, after I would stay over (at her one-bedroom apartment) (back when I still smoked cigarettes but of course she did not, she never did) (where, one night when she went to sleep before I did and I took off my clothes and climbed into bed with her, she screamed, loudly, and I said, “It’s okay! It’s me, Levi!” and then she screamed again, and then she finally relaxed and I got into bed) but I mention to her that I am not as impatient in that area as I used to be. (Since I quit smoking I have found myself able to take things a little more easily in the morning. ) In fact, I tell her, I have been using a pour-over method myself, not a Chemex but just a cone-shaped thing I put a filter in. Then, as we sit next to the window, near various people who are clearly comedy types in town for the Women in Comedy Festival, I find myself listening to Esther as she talks about the trip to England she took with a friend. Mostly they spent their time in London, but they also made a trip out to Oxford. She mentions that she had the thought, while there, that she should just talk to one of the business owners there—say, a chocolatier, and that she should say, “Hey, let me apprentice with you, and I could help you extend your business overseas and open a shop in New York. ” I speak in support of this idea (which I am aware is not something she would ever really do) and she talks in more depth for a few minutes about her fantasy of uprooting herself to live in another country. After hearing what she has to say, I provoke the longest, hardest laugh I have ever elicited from her when I say, “You know, hearing you talk about this reminds me—I have a book you should read! It’s called Eat, Pray, Love. ” Maria Bamford is of course great. Her performance is at a neat little movie cinema with delicious popcorn. The ride westward, back to my car, has me thinking about Esther. I see her as a big city mind tied to a suburban life. She seems so lonely to me. 75 After some more days of classes I drive to my now-usual place to park when going to Boston, the Woodland station in Newton. I take the green line into the city and walk past Fenway Park to what is now the House of Blues in Boston. Bad Religion is headlining, and although I’ve been into them since I was a teenager, I have never seen them live. Originally the band Against Me! had been slated to be one of the openers, but I have recently learned that they backed out of the tour. But The Bronx is playing instead, and that’s cool, too. Standing around, on the floor but away from the slam dancers, leaning against railings as much as I can because I hate standing and my ankles always hurt after a while, I throw back a couple of beers but mostly just watch the show. It’s a good time. 76 At around 4:45 in the morning, after the end of my Saturday night shift at the Amherst Domino’s Pizza, I hand in the last of my money. As usual, the various employees smoke cigarettes in the back room. Today, someone even has their cannabis pipe out. “Okay!” says Lara, the manager, to me. Typically, this is when I would turn my back and leave for the night… but I have something to say. “And, uh. The schedule hasn’t really been working for me, so I think I’m going to make this my last shift. ” “Well. Okay, then,” says Lara. “Should I leave the hat and shirt?” “To hand over your last paycheck we’ll need those, yes. ” Pavel says to me, “Well, think about it this way: you lasted longer than most people. ” 77 Rosalyn and I have finally begun to watch the series Mad Men. And after several episodes I finally say, “There’s Julie!” as Hildy, the minor character my old acting colleague Julie McNiven plays, starts making appearances. It has been thirteen years since I was Horatio and she was Ophelia in a production of Hamlet at Holyoke Community College. And although I have not been behaving like a proper boyfriend, Rosalyn still helps me with the “stats as art” project I am required to submit for Dr. Sladyk’s Professional Development class. The two of us go to get materials and I actually snap in the car, and have an angry moment, blurting out in frustration, “I’ll just have to figure out the project overnight!” because, because… oh, it is a bunch of reasons coming together. But she is in a rush, and I am trying to think through the concept of this art project (which needs to relate to a statistic in my research paper, so I am doing it on self-efficacy’s relationship to college GPA) even though I do not much care about the project, because, because, oh, I don’t know, and it has really been striking me the wrong way when I come home and it is Rosalyn on the couch, always on the couch, never moving, always looking at a screen, and I just connect that to things I wish always to keep away from. But maybe what it is we both need is just food. We go and eat some, and then, yes, as I mentioned, she helps me paint cardboard to make a graduation cap stuck in a jar of doubt and in the morning I bring it to campus for ten o’clock, as instructed, and then I drive back to Chicopee and nap with the dog on the bed, and then I go back to campus for two o’clock to pick up my project, as instructed, and I find that mine has not been chosen to be among the pieces displayed in the college library. Oh, well. 78 After our Peds class, one of my classmates and I grab a table in the area outside the classroom. She and I are preparing a presentation on the topic of the brain’s neuroplasticity. At one point, she makes a suggestion of a way to rearrange one of the powerpoint slides we have been designing. I think about her suggestion for a moment, then I say, “Yeah, you’re right. ” “Did you say I’m right?” She is young; nice-seeming; unassuming. “I never hear that. ” “Aw. That’s unfortunate,” I say. “No, I just mean… I don’t think my boyfriend would ever say I was right. ” “That’s pretty common, I’m sure, in a relationship… that one person’s the one who’s always right. ” “I get—like most girls, I guess—emotional about things, and I’ll talk to him about, like, deciding what I want to do my paper on, and I’ll say, ‘I don’t know… this is what I really want to do it on, but I don’t know…’ and he’ll look at it logically and say, ‘Will you get a good grade if you do it on that?’ and I’ll say, ‘No…’ and he’ll say, ‘Then do it on the other thing. ’ And I’ll be like, ‘Well…’ and he’ll be like, ‘That’s what will get the good grade, so you should do it on that. ’” Some days I don’t know who’s more old-timey, me or my younger classmates. 79 “What can I do to help?” I ask Rosalyn, just after I climb into bed, just after she climbs into bed. She takes time to consider, but does not seem confused about the meaning of the question. “Hug me and cuddle me. Keep nudging me to go with you to the gym. ” “Should you be going to the gym more?” I ask. “I should,” she says. “So why don’t you go to the gym more?” “Because I hurt. ” “So why should you be going to the gym more?” “Because if I don’t, I’ll hurt more later. ” “So why don’t you go to the gym more?” “Because I hurt…” 80 Me to Rosalyn: “Most people just need someone to tell them who to be. That’s their personality. Then everyone around them figures out what story that personality belongs in… where it makes sense that they should go next. And then everyone pushes to make sure that person goes down the path it’s been decided they’re going down. But when other people can’t convince you of where you’re going in life… or when you don’t want to be in the story they’ve picked for you… you might have to fool your own brain, since no one else is fooling it for you. ” 81 Rosalyn to me: “I don’t need you to ask me why I’m not walking more. I need you to take me out walking. ” 82 Friday. I’m not awake until around eleven. Dishes. Laundry. Payment of a parking ticket. I head to Northampton, enter the Haymarket Café, walk the narrow corridor that is the entranceway parallel to the stairway. I wait in line in front of the glass cases full of cake slices and croissants and macaroons and fancy little treats I never in my earlier years would have thought to spend the required three or four dollars on, although by now I have tried many of them. I ask for a coffee and hand over two dollars in exchange for the porcelain mug full of it. Then I walk around the counter to where a few little carafes, along with pourable glass containers full of white sugar and packets of brown “sugar in the raw” are available. I use the smallest carafe, the one marked “s” for “soy milk”. I choose a table, pull out my seat, grab my laptop from the case I have brought in. Multiple windows are open on my laptop, showing multiple web pages. I have one of my email inboxes open, along with Facebook, Twitter, and various documents uploaded for this semester’s courses. I sit alone at my table, for this is America and only in rare situations would anyone think of sitting at another person’s table. Eventually, Rosalyn is out of work. She texts to tell me that she is stopping at home before heading to Northampton to join me for the Amanda Palmer show. Time passes, and time passes, and then she and I are meeting intentionally on the street. She still hasn’t eaten, so I suggest that we take care of that. Her choice is to head to Osaka so that she can eat some sushi. This takes some time… …and when we enter the Calvin Theatre, there is an opening act on the stage. He is one man, performing under the name ACLU Benefit. (I find the joke that is this name choice to be a bit like a wine I am not certain I like but whose finish I can admit is interesting and complex. ) Rosalyn and I have front row tickets, but the woman with the flashlight who checks our tickets suggests that we should sit in one of the empty seats farther back until there is a break between sets. However, at the end of the first song we see ACLU Benefit play, Amanda walks onto the stage and it becomes clear that there will be no actual breaks between sets, but rather just introductions of the openers and unstructured conversations with them. “I can seat you anyway, if you’d like,” says the woman with the flashlight. I hesitate, presumably twisting my face into various shows of deliberation, until she asserts, “It’s fine. Come on. I’ll let you down to your seats. ” Someone else is in one of our seats. I feel bad about this, and even worse when, just after Amanda has played the great song “In My Mind” on ukulele, the woman we displaced yells out to Amanda and to us and to the front row, “I lost my wallet!” She adds, “I really did lose my wallet!” since the just-finished song has a reference to losing a wallet. Rosalyn and I get up and look under our chairs, but we see no wallet. I enjoy the show. It is very much informal and interactive, just a singer-songwriter and several hundred people who like her work hanging out in a music hall. 83 The following Wednesday is an oddity in my planner. It is Bay Path’s second annual Academic Achievement Day. Regular classes are not held, but in the case of the OT program at least, all students are required to attend. For us the day begins with an exhibition of posters we have put together on the topics of our research papers. It is probably true that I would have selected a different topic for my paper if I had known I would need to stand at a cafeteria table and discuss it for an hour with my peers and others associated with the college. Still, the experience ends up going better than I anticipated. And once we have finished with that we all need to hang around campus until the afternoon, but it is our choice which events we attend. Some events, like the dance and choral performances, are in the big auditorium, while others, like the discussion of a student’s creative thesis, are in a normal classroom. At the end of the day I and Kathryn, one of my classmates, surprise each other by both walking towards a lecture on “Elucidating Paleodietary Trends in North American Horses from Hyracotherium to Equus Using Tooth Wear Analyses”. Which is not everyone’s idea of a good time, maybe. "

When I get back home in the afternoon, I plop myself down on the couch with Kaylee for a nap. I turn on CNN for the background noise. The background noise ends up being reports about explosions at the Boston Marathon. Rosalyn comes home after I have moved my nap to the bed. I get up to greet her, but when she heads downstairs to put laundry in the wash I place myself back on the couch and doze off. Then, when she returns, I say, sleepily, “I’ll move, so that you can use the couch. ” Then I’m lying on the floor of the living room, where I take a serious nap for a while. I slowly wake up. This gets Kaylee’s attention and prompts her to lie on top of me. Rosalyn and I talk briefly. About something she mentions, “It kind of gets burned in your mind after you see it. ” I respond, sort of oddly, “That’s kind of like the dream I had recently, where I watched someone jump in front of a train. ” “Yes,” she says. Then: “I watched that happen, once. In Washington. ” Eventually I stand and say, “Let’s see if there were any more explosions in Boston today. ” “I hope not,” she says. CNN is replaying the same video I earlier fell asleep to. I don’t leave it on for long. Of course, with me being who I am and the Internet being what it is, I have lots to read and see about what happened. Then Rosalyn is asking me to go and switch over her laundry at a specific point in the future, and when that time comes she says, “It’s time for laundry,” and I drop what I’m doing to walk down the stairs and get her clothes. I don’t like being directed in such terms to do someone a favor. I stay up and try to help her file her taxes before midnight, but some issues with how the tax software transferred information from previous years causes weird issues. Once we bother to research IRS policy we find that penalties for late filing only apply if you owe, anyway. We file her federal and Massachusetts state taxes, but save the Pennsylvania filing for the following day. Do you remember Conor? I met him through Alice at HCC? In the comic one-act, Pinny, which my own play, Memory of a Nightmare, had to follow back in the year 2000, he dumped things like bottles of soda over his head between scenes. His sister now has two broken arms and a broken back from the bombing. My own cousin, Eric Fortin, was uninjured, but he was across the street when the explosions happened. There is blood on every newspaper cover the next day, and I find myself sitting with a chocolate croissant and a coffee and a beer inside that dark place called the Foundry on Main Street in Northampton (where the Yellow Sofa used to be) and I am writing up a request for approval of a dumbed down version of the research I wanted to do for Dr. Sladyk’s Professional Development class this semester from the institutional review board at Bay Path. And that night I help Rosalyn finally file that Pennsylvania return. And the day after that, that research request is approved. And I try to talk to someone at the Literacy Project in Greenfield, because my summer “level one fieldwork” is not quite like any fieldwork experience I have ever heard of, sort of an exercise in community-based practice wherein we find for ourselves (working alone or in a group) an agency for which we can complete a needs assessment and run a group appropriate to the people they serve. I find the location of this place (which mostly runs GED courses) and find myself walking up stairs past unrelated offices and then after several floors, slightly wanting for breath, nervously being surprised by someone I see there, and I quickly stammer and try to explain what I want, but she says that they close down during the summer, and to avoid any further self-humiliation I just say okay and thank her for her time and walk back down the stairs and yell awful things at myself, driving south down Interstate 91 on a beautiful Spring day. 86 I go to a Weight Watchers meeting. It’s partly a way to complete a particular assignment (analyzing some sort of group that meets in the community) but also because I have been ripping all of my 33- and 34-inseam pants. At the meeting I weigh in at 227—a number that distracts me throughout the entire meeting. I actually then go out and buy a bathroom scale to confirm that instead of losing the weight I hoped to lose after moving to Massachusetts I have actually gained an additional 40 pounds. 87 “How much time do you have left in school?” my aunt Kim asks, standing in my mother’s kitchen. Our paths have just happened to cross on this, a Thursday afternoon in the month of April, four days before my thirty-second birthday. “I have classes until the end of December,” I say. “Then I have six months of fieldwork, which I’ll be doing in D. C. ” “D. C. ? And that’s all finalized?” “The school arranges it. They contact the site and everything. But I let them know what area I want to do it in. ” “Do they provide lodging or anything?” “No, but Rosalyn knows people down there. ” “Will she be moving at the end of the year, too?” “No, she’ll be staying here for that time. She’ll be waiting to hear from OT programs she applied to, and where she goes will depend on where she gets in. ” “So, you two won’t live together, then?” “If she gets in to one of the schools around D. C. we will. ” “You guys are so funny. ” My mother comments to her: “They both know what they want to do. ” I add, “It’s better to spend some time apart than to not have the lives we want long-term. ” I head out to walk to my car. I see Kim’s husband, my uncle Phil. My conversation with him is more brief, but he asks me where I’m off to and I say that I’m off to school and he says, “Well, good. Someone ought to get an education around here,” and smiles. It is a gray and rainy day, but one without rain. 88 Alix’s birthday gets celebrated. Rosalyn and I are about fifteen minutes late. We’re also the first two people there. We take our seats in the downstairs area of Pizzeria Paradiso in Northampton. Alix and Flip end up being a little over an hour late. Eventually there are about a dozen of us eating there. After food, we go to the World War II Club. I meet Alix’s friend from Nova Scotia and am able to realize my dream of casually proving to someone from the Maritimes that I know how to correctly pronounce “Newfoundland”. At some point in the night, Salma is saying nice things about Rosalyn to me. It comes up that she didn’t realize Rosalyn and I were doing the polyamorous thing. Meanwhile, there were moments when I thought Eric (Salma’s new boyfriend) was acting a little standoffish, even dismissive with me. She seems really happy about him, though. 89 I have a birthday, too. On a whim, since we are parking immediately across from Roberto’s in Northampton, I say to Rosalyn that we should go in there. I haven’t been to this restaurant since 1997, when I took that girl I met outside the Fiona Apple concert to get a pizza here using a gift certificate I won from a radio station. Salma arrives on time tonight, which is nice, and the restaurant is a hit. And I am thirty-two years old. 90 Rosalyn is looking in the bathroom mirror as the two of us are ready to step out the door. She tells me that she had dreams last night of mobs of white Americans committing violence against nonwhites, to a soundtrack of patriotic songs like “Proud to be an American”. Which reminded her of coming back from her year in Australia post-9/11: “I didn’t recognize my own country,” she recalls. 91 I’m supposed to collect data for that research paper. It’s a beautiful day on the Bay Path campus. I have the blue clipboard I bought for my first semester fieldwork back in 2011, when I was a Jefferson student. Thirty copies of two pages—a consent form and two assessments printed together along with demographic questions on one page—but I find that I don’t have the gumption to approach anyone. I call Salma to ask if she’s available before the weekend to walk around Bay Path with me. She offers to join me on the weekend… but by the time the weekend comes around, her back is once again interfering with her ability to drive places. Fortunately, Rosalyn has also agreed to help me with my data collection, so she is the one who comes with me to the campus and does most of the approaching of students and staff there. 92 “Butterfly in the sky, I can go twice as high!” -an astronaut who is an asshole to butterflies 93 Chris comes to visit again. He and Rosalyn spend a Friday night in a hotel room. On Saturday I join them for dinner and dessert in Northampton. 94 Rosalyn and I still are watching Mad Men at night. I usually go through about a half a bottle of wine and several rice cakes while we do this. 95 Finals. 96 Rosalyn comes home and we leave to do something or other and end up stopping at the Mountain Farms plaza in Hadley, and Rosalyn says that she’ll be inside Michael’s Crafts, and I say okay and that I will find her there in a few minutes, after I grab a coffee from the Starbucks area of the Barnes and Noble. I ask for my coffee with soy milk, and as I’m waiting for my drink the woman with the bright orange hair behind the counter says hello to me, and it’s Tina. I say, “Wow! New hair! I really like it. ” We briefly catch up. 97 Sunday, I make a quick visit back at Brenda and Dave’s place in Montague, where my relatives have gathered for Mother’s Day. On the way back to Chicopee I hit various supermarkets to get food. I see Tina again at Trader Joe’s. I acknowledge her, and this forces her to remove her large headphones. “Hi, again,” I say. “With your new hair, now you’re easy to spot. ” A classmate from Bay Path also says hello to me before I get to the register. I seem to run into a lot of people at Trader Joe’s. 98 The next day is Monday, which sees me back in class for the first meeting of my effectively-usually-semi-weekly summer class, which covers a pretty random assortment of topics. After that, my cousin Amy has no work to send me. I pick up Kaylee the chihuahua so that she can join me on the bed. I take a quick nap. I take care of miscellaneous little things that need to be done around the apartment. Rosalyn comes home. I drop off laundry downstairs, passing by my mother. I decide to ask how things are going between her and Bruce. “Well,” she says, shruggingly, “I don’t like him and he doesn’t like me. ” She says that the house is unnecessarily large and that she imagines herself either living with one of her siblings or having an apartment, perhaps up north around Montague, where it seems the family is again centering. Rosalyn and I drive to Starbucks to get coffee just before the place closes. Then we go for about a half hour long walk together. I tell her about the conversation with my mother. She says, “I’ve actually had a disagreement with my mother on the topic of what a child owes a parent. I think it’s nice to take care of your parents as they get older, in the way that it’s making the world more like the sort of world you want to live in. But still, no one ever asked to be born. And I think it’s fair for a parent to expect that what they need will be taken care of, but that’s different from what they want. I definitely had a sort of crisis when I was around twenty years old: ‘How will I be able to afford the sort of life I want to have while also enabling my mother to have the retirement she wants?’” Before we reach my car, we stop at a Redbox machine in front of a supermarket. Rosalyn is interested in seeing what movies are available, and she is asking me questions about the rental process. “I don’t think I’ve ever used one of these machines on my own,” I say. This is an odd thing to realize, actually, since DVDs have been vended out of these stations for quite a number of years now. But we get The Hobbit (more for her) and Beasts of the Southern Wild (more for me) before returning home. 99 Summer now. Things have calmed down. Classes twice per week until mid-June. Sometime before the end of August I need to find an organization in this geographic area which would welcome an OT student looking to do a mental health needs assessment and run a therapy group for the population it serves. This summer I also will tag along with an early intervention therapist for a couple of days. Then I have another full semester of classes to complete. In a few weeks I will have an odd sort of getaway, because odd sorts of getaways are my thing. I’ll be dropping off Rosalyn in Boston while I go alone for the weekend to Moosehead Lake in Northern Maine. Then I’ll return to Boston on her birthday to dine with her and her visiting father. She and I will get a room for the night. Then, the morning after that, I’ll leave early to go to my morning class in western Massachusetts. "

    "body": "100 Rosalyn’s birthday weekend happens. On Friday we leave Kaylee to stay downstairs with my mother and Bruce and I drive Rosalyn to Medford, where the two of us have dinner at that pan-Asian place with Chris and Angela and then spend the night in the guest room of their house. In the morning I hardly exchange a word with our hosts before Rosalyn leads me out to my car. We’re running to Target to pick me up some clothes, since all the clothes I packed were mistakenly left in Chicopee. Then I’m dropping Rosalyn off back at the house just as Chris and Angela are about to leave to go to something they’re running late for. And then I am driving north. And then I am on the Piscataqua River Bridge. Hello, Maine! I’ve set my GPS to Bull Moose Music in Portland, just because that was a place Arden had mentioned multiple times—(even while living in Pennsylvania she tried to only purchase CDs from there)—which I had never ended up visiting in my adventures around Maine with her. It’s nice to see independently-owned places of that ilk still surviving. Sitting in my car in that parking lot, then, I am searching for a place to eat. I am checking options using the GPS. I am thirty-two years old. How will this trip go? Lots of time to spend alone… will I find myself responding to invasive questions tossed backwards in time by entities whose intentions I do not understand, about whom there is much to ask but about whom there can be so few answers? (When will there be radical opposition to this obsequiousness? Any inquiry gets politicized. At this rate, in five years, every question that one could ask about magic or time travel will sound ridiculous, will be associated with the ravings of the fringe. ) Or will I find myself just lying on one of the twin beds and watching-but-not-watching the television? Some of the psychic subtext of this trip to me involves the question of how I feel about Maine now that Arden is out of my life completely… Arden, although she and I never really came close to working out, introduced me to experiences of relaxing kindness and meaningful domesticity in ways no one else had yet done for me at any point in my oddball, connected-yet-still-outsider-y life. To think of Arden now is to remember the most important character in my life whom everyone forgets. Alice spent some time staying with me and Arden in our apartment in North Wales, Pennsylvania… but now Alice and I, too, don’t communicate with each other much. Salma met Arden, but only briefly. Nowadays, if Salma and I end up discussing my dating history, she’ll remember to mention Arden, but only as an aside. Arden was the last person I dated who saw the incarnation of myself that would need to slip off, sullen, even when surrounded by honest smiles. She was the last to see me stand beneath clear skies on a cold and windy night, doing my best to keep a Winston cigarette alive, gazing into a fighting darkness with love in my heart but dread at the uncertainty of how I was going to find a place in this world when, after years of trying and planning and research, I still had no good leads, no offers of help, no suggestions or sustainable ideas for what I—a college-educated, articulate, and not unhandsome member of the most privileged race in the wealthiest nation on the planet—could do to justify my subsistence as an independent adult. She was the last to see waves of desperation obscuring my love for her. So what to make, now, of the state I could only begin to understand thanks to her? And of its city? Even five years later, I can’t forget the copy of Portland magazine she had in the living room—the one with a couple out in the city on the cover—and her saying to me, “That could be us. ” When she said things like that, her words were a letter of introduction for my identity. I could hand over her recommendation and finally be welcomed into pictures of uncontroversial joy. That was strange, in a way: she was a queer woman who led me by the hand into the straight world. Portland, Maine in autumn had a drama to it. One would expect summer to be the best time to experience it, but I remember feeling dwarfed by the foreboding winds while also feeling motivated by them. I liked that. I drive through some of the small towns I remember from visiting with Arden. I stop in one, get a couple slices of pizza and a bottle of soda. There. I’m not hungry anymore. My new phone has been turning itself off frequently. Today it’s not even agreeing to stay on for more than five minutes at a time. In Waterville, after getting coffee at the local Starbucks, I head to the nearest place that services Verizon phones (a Radio Shack). The friendly employee there tells me that I’ll probably have to call up tech support, have them mail me a replacement, and send in my current phone to them—the usual telephone replacement protocol. North of Waterville is trees, residences probably worth less than my (not at all expensive) car, and the occasional general store. This is what I am driving through for quite some time until I get to Greenville, which gives me my first view of Moosehead Lake. It was Arden who told me about this region, too, but I have almost forgotten this fact. Where I am is not anyplace I went with her. This is my own vacation. I pull in at the Moose Mountain Inn. It’s a misty day on what was forecast to be a rainy weekend, so the parking lot is almost completely empty, certainly quieter than I was expecting for a Maine tourist destination in June. I get my keys and find my room. I know that I will soon fall asleep, even though it’s the afternoon. To be well prepared for an overnight in a small town in Maine, though, I first make sure to pick up some cold coffee drinks that I can keep in the mini-fridge, along with a pizza from the local corner grocer/pizza takeout place. After eating, sleeping and waking up into darkness, I then spend my night researching home ownership. Using the Internet to collect information and to develop an educated opinion over the course of years seemed to work for choosing a career; why not apply this strategy to other areas of life, as well? So I find myself reading arguments about the pros and cons of owning real estate, not to mention home values in different places and what it takes to qualify for mortgages at certain price points. I keep at this until the night begins to brighten at a surprisingly early hour. Tim Burton’s feature-length adaptation of Dark Shadows plays on HBO at a low volume; I’m not really paying attention to it. Then I’m off to seek moose, since dawn and dusk are the best times to see them and I have never seen a moose before. Taking the road north along the western side of the lake leads my vehicle to cross paths with several moose, actually, along with deer (who, it turns out, are prettier than Pennsylvania deer, more fluffy and similar in appearance to Bambi, the Disney cartoon deer). Then I drive to Moxie Falls, which from the road requires a nice little hike of about a mile to get to. I make the walk while drinking a cup of hot coffee, which finally in this town I was able to find after a long morning of places either not being open or not being extant. By mentioning this all in the span of one paragraph I am understating the time it took me to make the drive: stuff in northern Maine is very much spaced apart. So by the time I make it back to Greenville and am in the vicinity of my hotel it is like noon or something, and I am beginning to get tired and it is always sort of weird to be walking around among the other humans when you have woken up in the middle of the night and then stayed awake into the morning and you are becoming tired, but I end up back at the supermarket to buy some food for the evening. (The hotel room has a microwave as well as a mini-fridge. ) I wake up just before dusk. I procure myself another coffee and again take the cup for a hike. This time the hike is much more brief, and much more nearby: the parking lot itself leads to a trail which is mostly vertical and leads to a nice view of the lake. After much climbing and some slipping on mud, I take in the view (but sadly cannot capture it well because have you ever tried to take a photograph of a distant object using a cell phone camera?) and then I am again spending the night awake in this hotel room and waiting for the sun to come up and once the sun is up I decide to leave my room early, just leaving the keys in the room and calling the front desk from my car later on in the day. I drive and drive and drive until I again reach the Starbucks in Waterville, Maine, and there I review the details on the remaining assignments for my summer class, which I still put off because I would rather research other degrees I could potentially pursue in the future—a doctorate in OT? An MFA in Creative Writing? Both?—and yet eventually, even though it is a thing I truly and greatly enjoy to sit at a coffee place and take care of my own business in a town I usually have no reason to visit, I have to leave, but all this morning I have been texting Rosalyn and all morning she has not been responding and my phone is completely dead now and so I can’t call and when I get to the door of Chris and Angela’s house I knock knock knock knock but there is no answer and I knock knock knock knock again but there is still no answer and so with my blue 2009 Volkswagen Jetta parked on the street in that residential neighborhood I walk to where I can find a place to sit with public wifi. That ends up being a deli sort of place, where I order a sandwich. From there I email Rosalyn, asking her to reply if she gets the message. I email my mother, hoping that she’ll be at her computer. I want to ask her to try calling Rosalyn, but my mother is not responding to her email. Drat. So, I drink a soda. I’m thankful to have it; I was getting disgustingly sweaty, walking outside on this warm June day. I find some service that sends text messages over the Internet and I use that to send text messages to my mother’s phone, asking her to check her email. I finish my sandwich. I see that my aunt Cheryl is on Facebook, so I message her. She responds. I get her to call my mother, who calls Rosalyn, who emails me that I should feel free to walk back to the house and that the door will be open for me. Back there I hug her, listen to a couple of her stories from the weekend, then fall asleep. A few hours later I’m woken up so that we can prepare to meet her father at the nearest location of the inexpensive Mexican food chain On the Border. It’s my second time meeting Rosalyn’s father. While Rosalyn is in the bathroom I ask him what are his aspirations in life. Because of course that’s what I do! But the question isn’t actually out of the blue. It relates to something he has already mentioned—a question he was once asked while speaking to students at a university. One of the students asked him how he had become so successful and accomplished, and his response was just to say that he had never really thought himself successful or accomplished. And maybe that was his secret, he suggested to us, sitting at On the Border with us, cutting an enchilada with his fork. His past successes had never seemed to him worth resting on, so he continued striving. The sky is raining on Rosalyn and me as we leave the restaurant in my car. We drive west, away from the Boston area. Walden Pond comes up in our conversation, and I mention that is easy to get to on the way to or from greater Boston. She tells me she really got into Thoreau when she read him in high school. A few minutes later I see a sign and notify her that in fact, Walden Pond is just off the next exit. She says that she would like to pull off and drive by it, then, and so that’s what we do. Everything is closed up, though. All we do is drive by the various closed gates before circling back to the highway. Rosalyn tells me the pond is larger than she expected it to be: “That’s more what I would call a lake,” she says. So from Walden Lake we head back to Chicopee, where Kaylee, in the few days we have been gone, has freaked out and begun to protect her Lambies (two identical stuffed lamb toys) as if they were her pups. She gives us crazy looks and lies on top of them in her bed, growling if we approach. She has never before growled at Rosalyn, making this especially concerning behavior. Rosalyn does some searching on the Internet and decides that this is likely connected to the fact that Kaylee had just been in heat a few weeks prior. Apparently it is not unheard of for pregnancy-like symptoms to develop and sometimes lead to maternal behaviors toward inanimate objects. We end up taking the Lambies away from her while also making sure to bond with her by engaging in healthy pack behavior, spending time together and throwing around balls and that sort of thing. And I don’t think sleep really happens for either Rosalyn or myself that night. Rosalyn is too concerned about Kaylee to sleep, while I have assignments I need to complete. 101 I notice that V. unfriended me on Facebook at some point. It very well might have been a while ago; I noticed because I was going through and reworking some of the earlier parts of the Life Story, then it occurred to me that I hadn’t seen anything from her in my Facebook feed for quite some time. 102 Unexpectedly, on June 19, 2013, Rosalyn inquires more than superficially about things related to how I am feeling about her and my relationship. At the time when she asks I am not distraught or anything, but I am reacting to her having recently returned home after Salma canceled plans on her. I am basically waiting to see what she is doing with her night before I decide what I am going to do. This is the hardest part, for me, of living with someone: how thrown off I get after plans get changed. But quickly she gets to asking what I want: “Are you feeling now that you want to be together full-time, part-time, just friends?” “Just friends,” I say, because that’s how I’m feeling. I expect the conversation to go on from there, but it doesn’t, really. We go to sleep early. She wakes up occasionally to resume crying and to write. At five in the morning, I ask if she would like me to drive somewhere and get her breakfast. She requests a breakfast sandwich from Starbucks, so that’s what I get her. 103 Then, that weekend, we go to Cape Cod with my mother, oddly enough. The idea came about when the three of us were in the same room together and it came up that my mother had not gone for a visit to the Cape in some time, and that Rosalyn had never been to that part of Massachusetts. So the idea of us all going out sometime this summer was generated. After checking with my uncle Albert and aunt Jain, it was suggested that we head out that weekend and stop by the house of my cousin Jen and her husband Adam for their twin boys’ birthday as part of our trip. (Rosalyn was initially reluctant to come along in light of our recent conversation, but after the two of us went for some food at the Pizzeria Uno in the Holyoke Mall, we were in accord that spending two days out there as planned should be okay. ) So to Marstons Mills we go, after waking early as planned and stopping at the first rest stop on the Massachusetts Turnpike and then driving the rest of the way without any other stops and parking on the pebble driveway and saying hello to Jain, then going out to the British Beer Company in the town of Sandwich. “I think this is the first time I’ve been out to eat with my mother since, maybe, my twenty-first birthday,” I say while we wait for our food. My mother is unable to produce an example to counter this claim. Jain talks about the past in ways I haven’t heard. She doesn’t seem to know that when she makes references to living upstairs from my mother in Turners Falls or my mother being underage and so having to wait outside while the rest of the gang went into a bar, that in my thirty-two years on this earth so far I have learned very little about the character of my mother prior to my birth (or even after it). “Do you smoke pot?” she asks me and Rosalyn casually. We reply in the negative. Jain does, apparently, but Albert quit when he quit cigarettes? We’re driving in my uncle Albert’s orange car, which I take to be less than utilitarian. (“I don’t know much about the semiotics of car ownership,” I say, “But I know an anachronism when I see one. ”) Jain takes us to the Heritage Museums and Gardens, where we walk around a path and look mostly at bushes where, some other month, flowers would be in bloom. After we’ve returned to the house in Marston Mills, Rosalyn and I depart for our explorations of downtown Hyannis. First we buy some cookies, plus a cup of coffee for me. Then we walk around for a bit. Then we decide that since we’re not hungry yet we should head back to the beach we passed on the way into town. So, yes, we do some walking at Craigville Beach. Rosalyn takes off her shoes for this. I wear my shoes and, as always when I am in public and outside of a gym, long pants. It’s pleasant, I remember as we walk where the water moves up and down the sands, to walk like this in the late afternoon under partially cloudy skies, and to look out at the meditative scene that is a large and dynamic body of water, and to remember how pathetic we humans are, when looked at in a certain way, because I mean come on we are just stuck on land, unable to survive in the water, and the water just keeps on taunting us. Also, we look at shells. Then we go back into Hyannis and eat some great food at the Beech Tree Cantina. I also have a margarita or two, while Rosalyn talks about her childhood and how it has made her the person she is today, and that leads to me talking about my childhood and how it has made me the person I am today, and then we are back at Jain and Albert’s house and it’s getting close to midnight when we return but my mother and Jain are still up in the living room, with Jain talking and my mother listening, and while Rosalyn goes upstairs to shower I try to fall asleep on the pads that have been laid down on the floor for the two of us. (My mother will be sleeping on the couch in the same room. ) Then it’s the morning and I am the first one awake, getting up to use the bathroom just after sunrise, and then Albert is up and then my mother is up and then we’re talking about our plans and having coffee and I am taking a quick shower and then we’re driving to Provincetown and the drive out there is actually not as lengthy as I remembered it being because the last time I went it was during the winter and the traffic was all driving very slowly and cautiously because it was snowing. And in Provincetown I once again get coffee and we walk down to where ferries depart for Boston and then Rosalyn starts to get excited about trying on clothes in a couple of places and so then I am standing around outside and it is now warm weather, appropriate in June, and there are groups of back-slapping men in casual khaki shorts walking past the loitering teenagers who lean on things, weekending gay couples, and aging locals. I flick my way through the latest Twitter and Facebook posts that have been pushed to my phone. Then, in a flash, Rosalyn says that she is getting sick of walking down the narrow corridor that is Commercial Street with so many people on every side, so we are then walking back to the pay lot where she parked the car, and then we are driving westward, this time on route 6A instead of 6. Also, we are stopping at every antique store we see, because Rosalyn wants to. I’m happy to see that she is enjoying herself on this weekend. 104 Things have been better in some ways between Rosalyn and me since we talked about things and seemingly broke up. It has since become clear that we have not really broken up. "

    "body": "105 “Please stop! Please stop! I’m crying. ” -Me receiving e-stim, calibrated for pain relief, at a level most people are unable to perceive. 106 Based on her reading of the Life Story through 2009, Rosalyn explains what she would have thought my life would be headed toward: “I would think that you would be one of the people, like some I met while living in Australia, who are putting together their various experiences into a patchwork of a life. There’s something very freeing, I think—there must be—about that sort of lifestyle, although of course those people by necessity live somewhat apart, in a world of their own, as fringe dwellers. That’s just because they never choose to have the things that would tie them to the mainstream of society. But yes, I would picture you living that sort of a life. Reading your observations and your comings and goings over the years was like watching you ride the wave of a changing world. I certainly wouldn’t expect to find you getting ready to graduate from occupational therapy school. ” When I start babbling somewhat embarrassingly about the way different people come together, weaving their way in and out of my personal narrative, she says to me, “You’re a hub. You’re the sort of person who makes connections happen wherever you go. Mary is like that, too. But I’m not, at all. ” Later on, after Rosalyn has gone to bed, I come to realize while looking through old chat logs that Ryan, the first person I was ever sexual with, in the years after we met up used to chat with me about the friends he made when we moved to New York City. He particularly wanted me to go see his friend Julian’s band, The Music Tapes, when they were out on their first tour. I encountered that name in the chat logs and said, “Wait a minute!” because I didn’t think I had actually listened to any Music Tapes albums but I knew who they were, knew that it was the main project of multi-instrumentalist Julian Koster, best known for his work in Neutral Milk Hotel. Googling further, I find that Ryan has been involved in some Elephant 6 recordings himself. I think back to the places in the Life Story where I found myself writing more about Neutral Milk Hotel than seemed to make sense. There were dozens of bands I probably liked just as much, listened to just as much and never happened to write about at all. But it felt like there was meaning behind it when I got the chance to shake Jeff Mangum’s hand in Vermont; it felt like there was meaning in Arden’s handwriting on the CD-R of On Avery Island she burned for me when we were first getting to know each other; meaning behind the stranger playing “In the Aeroplane over the Sea” on his guitar in 2004 as I sat in a circle in a forest among community college students discussing our vision quests; meaning in that other stranger who talked about them excitedly with me at Fire &amp; Water back whenever that was. I find my way to some of the music Ryan has played on. I find my way to old LiveJournal entries that I never saw, because we had stopped chatting by then. Funny how we don’t communicate, but we still communicate. “We” and we. Funny how humans pass on quirks, tics, sayings, without knowing it. It seems typical that I had heard Jeff Mangum’s voice before he ever heard mine. But had he really not heard my voice before? It depends, really, what you mean by “voice”. We hear so many voices. 107 I wake up at around 11:30 AM on July 8, 2013, with Kaylee hopping back and forth over me and eager to start the day. Gradually I commit to a state of awakeness. I sit up, throw my legs over the bed, and stand up with a sigh. There is no obvious reason why I should feel this reluctant about getting up; I figure I must have had interrupted sleep of some sort. I weigh myself in the bathroom. 206. 6 pounds without clothes, down from 227. 0 pounds with clothes about two months ago. Still more than twenty pounds to go before I’m where I was when I last moved from Philly to western Massachusetts; forty pounds until I’m at what both I and doctors who have talked to me about the matter agree is my ideal weight of about 165 pounds. 108 I receive the latest issue of the alumni magazine from UMass in the mail. Idly, as I’m standing around in the kitchen with Rosalyn, I browse through the pages. “Huh,” I say aloud. “I actually find it neat when there are pictures in here of the students from decades ago. ” I hand the magazine to her and let her look at some group shots from the 1960s. “The weird thing is looking at these pictures, in some respects it looks like it shouldn’t be so long ago, but then all of the students are white, and that makes it feel very much of another time. ” “Yeah,” she says. “I was trying to figure out what looked so strange. ” 109 The morning she comes back from her vacation I visit Dr. Sladyk at her office on campus to talk about the summer mental health “fieldwork” experience. I do this because it has become clear I will have to do this on my own rather than as part of any larger student group. I tell her that I have been thinking a library would be a good setting in which to run a group, but only by chance does our discussion come around (in a fairly roundabout way) to my interest in writing and my ideas for the use of life story creation as part of OT. She says that indeed it would be appropriate to contact a library and propose in particular a life story writing group. So I leave the OT House saying to myself, Oh yeah, I am going to make this happen. I tell my mom that I need to find a library to do my group in and that if she knows anyone who knows anyone at one, being given an introduction would make me feel a lot less intimidated about presenting the idea. She calls my aunt Brenda and asks, “Do you know anyone at any libraries?” She responds that her husband, Dave, goes to the local library every day and so probably knows everyone there. She says that yes, Dave would be able to walk me over there today, and so off I go to Greenfield. I meet Brenda, who is working at the Wilson’s department store on Main Street. (The Rooney’s building across the street is now occupied solely by a couple of other businesses who are renting the space from my her and Dave; I have heard that the building may soon be sold, decades after they first began hoping they could sell it. ) She calls Dave to come around and meet me in front of the store. I wait until I see him, then push open the old glass door and step into the blindingly bright, hot summer day. “This is my walk,” he says. “It’s only a couple of blocks to get to the library, and I do it most afternoons. ” “Why do you go to the library so much?” I ask. “What I do is I go for my walk, then I head into the back. I don’t talk to the people there a lot. I’m sort of shy. I’d just rather my own business. But I find the section with the medical books, and there’s a desk I like to sit at, and I just read and see what I can find out. ” “Why the medical section?” “Well, I try to find out about my health. There are things you would think a doctor would talk to you about, but they don’t. So I try to read what I can so I know what questions to ask. ” He makes no mention of the day’s heat, but as we walk along the sidewalk I continually wipe the sweat from my brow. I am dressed up in a long-sleeved, button-up shirt, black pants, and my nice black shoes. At the library, Dave introduces me to the woman behind the counter. I tell her that I am a Masters student in OT and that I wonder if there is someone I should talk to about an assignment that would involve me holding groups in their meeting room. The woman seems receptive but says that the person I want to see is on her lunch break. She suggests that I come back in an hour. I part ways with Dave, then, and sort of just drive around the area for a while before returning to the library. Things are busier when I arrive, so as I talk to the woman I have been referred to I speed up my pace. She is less receptive than the last woman; she just tells me to email the request to the library director. 110 Something I actually said in conversation while walking at night with Rosalyn: “God is a paperweight, keeping a person’s early beliefs from flying away. ” 111 To Dr. Karyn Sladyk’s office at the OT House on the campus of Bay Path College in Longmeadow, Massachusetts. She seems less patient than she was several days back, when I met with her for the first time about this summer mental health “fieldwork” I need to set up. I explain to her that I received a response from the Greenfield Public Library expressing some concerns, but that I am not sure whether it’s a no or just a qualified yes. She says to me that if I don’t have a library lined up by the next day I should switch to doing something at a senior center. “This place has been really cooperative with us in the past,” she says as she writes down the name of a site on the front of a sticky note. But I want to do this life story writing group, because, well, obviously. So I go to Haymarket, sit downstairs, and email a bunch of libraries. Once one has returned my message and seems ready to host me, I head back down the highway to meet with Dr. Sladyk again. She gives me information I didn’t understand before—that I do not need any type of signature or anything from the library to approve my plans for the group sessions—so I drive up to Greenfield. But there I’m told they wouldn’t even be willing to sign the one-page assessment form at the end of my work there.  So I walk out from there unsuccessful and shaking my head. But the Forbes Library has emailed me, and I’ll be driving southbound past Northampton anyway, so I decide that I will stop by to try and speak with someone there in person. And the woman I need to talk with turns out to be super nice and interested in helping me! And she schedules the sessions right then and there! And I am pleased! 112 Back when the assignments were set up, I agreed to put off my Spring semester pediatric fieldwork until the summer so that more of us students who were interested could do our assignments with an early intervention therapist. Now, on the last Friday in the month of July, it is finally time for me to tag along. The day seems to pass by quickly. I and one other student meet with the OT in the parking lot of the organization that employs her, in Springfield. We visit different households. Sometimes there is one parent present for the session; sometimes there are two. Sometimes there are siblings. Some of the families live in apartments, while others live in the sort of large, old houses with beautiful wood-paneled walls that working-class people could only afford in a place like Springfield. Babies of course need to be engaged in a certain way, and the effect of this is that the sessions are on the surface a bit like just walking into someone’s home and playing with their kid for forty-five minutes. The OT’s COTA joins us at one point in the day, taking part in one of the sessions and also coming along as we pick up some things at the school where the both of them them work on the side and where, coincidentally, my aunt Kim is an administrator. (They know her by name when I mention her). 113 I shower. I wear a black tee shirt and blue jeans. I drive to the Barnes and Noble and sit in the Starbucks area inside, with my laptop. There I write up a description of the group I plan to run.  I submit it as part of the required form: “Life Story Writing for Posterity and Well-being: This series of five two-hour group sessions is led by a current Master’s student in the field of occupational therapy. It explores how the writing and keeping of a cohesive life story can be a meaningful and therapeutic activity with benefits to the self and future generations. Meetings will include guided exercises and discussion. Those interested may attend one, some, or all of the meetings. All are welcome, but space is limited. ” 114 Rosalyn and I have been talking better. It is true that I feel like I have to be the one to initiate talk. Most of the time, there is no passion there. It feels strange to be thinking long-term with her, but I am. Thinking that actually, people with whom I can connect easily and with whom I feel that passion are out there and usually easier to bring into my life than someone like Rosalyn. That sort of feeling—haven’t I found that the people who do consistently give me intense butterflies, who do up my heart rate, are just as likely to disappear unceremoniously as anyone else with whom I hang out? Rosalyn is from a different world, has different strengths. Combining forces means that our skill sets are always available to the other. And if the type of relationship we have plus the lifestyle we choose allows me to still, y’know, explore the potential for different types of meaningful connections with other people, that all sounds pretty good. 115 After sitting on the couch and watching television with Rosalyn (which tends to make me grumpy, unhappy, feeling that the time has been wasted in addition to just that ick feeling of just sitting still and even worse if she pins me down with all or some of her body while we are doing so, which makes me feel trapped and prevents me even from fidgeting and I can only mention it so many times every so often before I just have to figure that it’s a moot point and that she’s going to do that no matter what, right?) she is ready to go to bed and I am not and so she asks me to take the dog out and I don’t want to but she pushes and then I walk around the block with Kaylee on a leash (because it is very common in the nighttime hours for Kaylee, if I just bring her to the yard instead of taking her for a walk, to just sit in the grass and do nothing, not pottying) and the things that make me say I should not try to stay with Rosalyn are really about lack. I lack chemistry with her. My thoughts about how the two of us could work out long-term and be good for each other’s lives are speculative when it comes to the benefits to her, and to me the benefits are all contingent upon my being able to have a lot of time alone and a rather involved life apart from her. But we’re not going to live drastically different lives in the next year or two based on where things are going with us. It’s best, at least, for my part to try my best while we are living together and to then when I am down around D. C. without her reflect and make sure that I am sure about what we are doing together. 116 Rosalyn’s massage therapist, Rachel, has asked Rosalyn to watch her chihuahua for a week. Although I was not myself thrilled about the idea, I did not strictly refuse to the welcome the dog. So, after her session this week, she brings the dog (Pookie) in her car back to Chicopee and tries to let Kaylee slowly introduce herself to him. This just produces some low-level growling, although when Rosalyn quickly gets up and walks over to Pookie and starts petting him, Kaylee very much flips out and convinces us that yeah, we will have to be keeping these two dogs in separate spaces, at least initially. 117 Rosalyn and I go for one of our walks through Chicopee. This time we walk a slightly longer, slightly different route from our usual one, and as she’s walking she stops to look at some leaves. She takes one and puts it into her mouth. “It’s wintergreen,” she says. “Okay. Now I will know what to tell the ER, at least. ” “Oh, it’s perfectly edible. ” “All I know is, I don’t want to eat anything that was grown in Chicopee. You say it’s edible, but I feel like it’s going to be tainted with pit bull urine and styrofoam McDonald’s containers from the 1980s. ” “Oh! And here’s an apple tree! It looks like there are crabapples, too. I want to try grabbing a crabapple so I can plant the seeds. ” “I can see the excitement on your face, so I will just say ‘Yay!’ here. ” “Ever since the seasons changed, I’ve found it remarkable how much grows around here. You have these long, barren winters, but the spring and summer are quite plentiful. ” “Yeah! Well, New Englanders had to do something to survive until the Industrial Revolution, I suppose. ” "

    "body": "118 Aug. 5, 2013. Forbes Library, Northampton, MA. The first session of my life story group is scheduled to begin in five minutes. Since no one has said that they are coming except Lyric, who only said that she might. I am therefore expecting to spend this time sitting alone in the Watson Room. But in case someone unexpectedly walks in through the door—(the web site requests pre-registration by email for those attending, but the sign at the building’s entrance advertises “occupational therapy” happening from 10 to 12 with no further details given)—I have all my materials out and ready. The computer document where I have written my group outline is open; my notebook is on the table in front of me with its own set of notes and its wealth of blank pages; and I have left out several pens set all in a row. By 10:11 I have spent several minutes looking at pictures of Northampton from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. I never used to take much interest in the books of historical photos from nearby towns when I would see them for sale in stores, but as I get older and somewhat sentimental about certain places, and as I watch and remark upon changes in those places as they happen even over the course of just a decade or two, I begin to feel more curious about that sort of thing. By 10:37 I have checked my Facebook feed, made another run to the toilet, and typed up the earlier part of this bit of Life Story I am writing now, which I was at first scribbling in longhand. The room in which I sit was rather warm and stuffy but has since begun to cool. Lyric I wrote in this Life Story about but did not write tons about, even though she was part of my so to speak inner circle and one of the people I was most closely in contact with during the time between my graduation from UMass (May 2006) and my moving to Philly for the first time (March 2007). Just as I’m writing this, Lyric walks into the room, escorted by one of the library staff. Lyric! So I run through the session with her. I ask her for comments on the exercises and make mental notes about them. After the time I have booked the library room for has run out I walk next to her to until the bus stop, then I drive south for about an hour and a half. I need to get to New Haven, Connecticut, which is the closest place I have found with a Citibank branch location, since I have been informed that going to a branch location today will be the only way for me to pay my credit card bill on time this month since an earlier attempt to pay the bill did not go through due to insufficient funds in the bank account I used and since the attempt I made to pay the bill after that was, oh, whatever, just canceled without my being notified or something, who knows, it’s not important, I’m just a person and not a corporation and so I am not entitled to having business conducted with me fairly. I stop in a supermarket parking lot in North Haven so that I can find the branch’s exact address and enter it into my GPS. A man wearing an orange vest and a name tag from the supermarket knocks on my window. I roll it down. “What shoes are you wearing?” he asks me. “I don’t know,” I say, keeping my eye on him. “You lost two of your hubcaps,” he says. “They’re missing, yeah, I know. ” “What shoes are wearing? Like, what brand?” “I don’t know. Why do you ask?” He begins walking away. “I like shoes. ” (He was almost certainly just someone with limited social skills who worked for the supermarket, but he triggered my wariness about strangers who approach unexpectedly. ) Eventually I make it to the Citibank, pay that bill, grab a coffee at Starbucks, then get back on the highway. As I’m heading north, I get an email from the person at the library, expressing second thoughts about the agreement to let me do my fieldwork there. So I swing by Bay Path, get directions from someone at the library to the building where most of the OT faculty are now keeping their offices, and happen to see Dr. Sladyk and Dr. Vaughn walking together into the building. “Cindy cc’d me on that text after the fieldwork!” Dr. Vaughn says, smiling. She’s referring to a positive and complimentary text about the day I tagged along with that therapist for several home visits with young kids. I follow Dr. Sladyk into her office and read her the email from the lady at the library. I tell her that it sounds like she just has some concerns about the verbiage in what she needs to sign, that otherwise I don’t think there’ll be any problem with my completing all the sessions, that she was great when I met with her. “I’ll call her soon,” she says. I then stop at the Verizon store in West Springfield to set up yet another replacement of my phone under its warranty. Once the employee there has entered all my information into his kiosk and arranged for the new phone to be shipped to me within two days, he hands my phone next to me and I check my email and see a message from Dr. Sladyk with the simple title “library said no” and the body “sorry, she said no”. Back in Chicopee, I walk in downstairs and ask about the dogs and am told by my mother that they’re both upstairs but am I going to take Kaylee down? I’m like, Just tell me what to do, because I’m distracted right now. So then I carry Kaylee down and my mom carries the visiting Pookie down, and Kaylee gets a little bit excited and barky in the yard but it all is not as bad as the previous night. Pookie is very calm, as we are seeing he tends to be. Then I’m upstairs and I just have to pull open this document on the computer and start typing because what the fuck? It’s quarter past five in the afternoon now and I’m not going to think about this now. Seriously? I have three weeks to finish this assignment. When Rosalyn gets home she has some money and is wanting to go out to eat, so I ride along with her to Northampton and we spend the night eating, getting coffee, and walking around. That night we watch an episode of Orange is the New Black on the couch in the living room. I sleep until late in the morning and head to Bay Path. As I walk in the door at the Emerson building (where the new OT faculty offices are) I see Dr. Sladyk. She of course knows what I am there for. She says that she is just leaving to go teach a class of the newly matriculated first-year students, but that the status of my summer fieldwork was this: the library’s problem was not with the initial contract but with the one-page assessment of me that needs to be filled out after I have finished my sessions. She says that she and Dr. Vaughn (who is, I notice at that moment through a pane of glass, in the next room) mentioned among themselves the idea of having one of the newly-graduated students supervise my group and fill out the form so that I might still get credit for what I have planned out. Back in Chicopee, Pookie (to whom we have given the enclosed porch, separated by a doggie gate from the main upstairs apartment where Kaylee stays) is crying for attention when he hears that I have returned. So before I can have lunch I’m outside with all three of the dogs plus my mom. Pedro, my mom’s dog, keeps making humping motions at Pookie, even trying to get up on him at some point. Pookie is pretty good at keeping his cool, though. Kaylee is barking at Pookie a little less when outside, although she still has issues with him encroaching on her territory when inside. I eat some pasta and walk out to the car with the intention of going to sit at with a coffee and my computer at the Holyoke Barnes &amp; Noble. I notice something odd, though: the fan beneath the hood of my car is still running, even though I’ve been home for about an hour. So I try calling the Volkswagen dealer in Enfield. “I’ll connect you to service,” says the woman who answers the phone, but the line just rings and rings and rings until she picks up again and says, “I guess he stepped away. Would you like me to take a message?” “Um,” I say. “No. I guess I’ll… go somewhere else, then?” “All right. Have a nice day. ” But then my mom tries calling instead and reaches someone who tries telling her that sometimes the length of time a car will keep its fans running after the ignition has been stopped will be excessive. She explains this to me after she gets off the phone, but I shake my head. “The fan usually runs for a few minutes after the car has stopped, but I’ve been home for a really long time. ” I drive down to the dealership, then, where a diagnostic check is run and I’m told that there is a problem with the air pump, which is still covered under warranty, and problems with the cooling fans, which will need to be replaced for a thousand dollars. I tell the guy that I will leave the car overnight to have the no-cost work done, but that I’ll have to get back to him about the other work. After a typical night of watching Netflix on the couch, I have a sleep that is very much disrupted, after Rosalyn has left, by the sounds of Kaylee and Pookie freaking out as I don’t know maybe Bruce or my mom are trying to take them out or whatever. When I finally give up on getting more rest, I see that the dogs are indeed somewhere other than upstairs. Then my mom is bringing them up and I’m trying before I have even had a drink of water let alone any coffee to set Pookie on the porch and to fix the gate back up, since apparently the gate has been knocked over during the night. And I don’t set it up right and so Pookie manages to get in and to tread on Kaylee’s turf and then yes of course there is much loud barking. Eventually, thanks to my mom’s car, I am back at Bay Path College, where again I luck out and find Dr. Sladyk. She invites me in to her office and says that her idea now is for me to pass out questionnaires to the people who attend (to have them rate how I ran the group) in addition to possibly being supervised by one of the newly-graduated OT students. Run the group next Monday as scheduled, then, she tells me. So from Longmeadow I drive to the Barnes &amp; Noble in Holyoke, sit with my computer, and take care of some email business to the best of my ability. After some backing and forthing it becomes clear that actually I shouldn’t try to run any more of the sessions at the library, that something else will have to be figured out. And I shrug my shoulders and sit and read a cover story from Time Magazine (in the actual physical magazine!) about child-free living and I answer the phone when I see that it is ringing and that Rosalyn’s name is displayed on its screen and I tell her that yes thank you for asking I would love it if she picked up some tacos for me while she is at the Chipotle getting herself something and I drive back to Aldenville and my mother is on the porch and I see that my latest under-warranty replacement for my phone has arrived in a small brown cardboard box shipped via FedEx but I do not bother to open it and I tell my mother that Rosalyn should be arriving any minute now and that I will let her go upstairs and take care of the dogs once she does because having Pookie has proven to be just as bad as I feared it might be and then Rosalyn is there and she is suggesting that we sit outside on the porch while the dogs get some outside time and I say sure and then I mention that we are just about out of kibble for Kaylee and Rosalyn says that she’ll just give herself a quick sluice in the shower and meanwhile Kaylee is downstairs hanging out with Pedro which is a little easier to deal with than when they have been hanging out with Pookie also because Pedro still keeps trying to hump Pookie which is rather funny to watch but also annoying and I am thirty-two years old and again I am fitting into the button-up shirts I purchased before gaining all that weight I gained over the course of the past academic year and I have been feeling especially confident and competent lately which usually comes before the unceremonious killing off of all my near-term hopes and then Rosalyn gets out of the shower and says that she is kind of hurting today in the way that she often hurts in her joints and muscles and especially around her pelvis but kind of everywhere ever since that whole getting hit by a bus while walking in a crosswalk in the District of Columbia thing which is a pain that seems to come and go and which she tries to help with all the massage and chiropractics she seeks out and which I wonder about when I think about how her life will play out as the decades pass and so she wants to sit but I feel like moving and I say that maybe I will go for a walk and she asks me if I particularly want to go out alone as in drive somewhere using my mother’s car as I did earlier in the day to go to the places I went to and I ask her if she is asking me this because she would like some time in solitude and she says that she does not need the apartment to herself but that there is something about my nervous energy that she would rather not contend with right now and I tell her not to worry about it at all and that I will just head out on my own for a bit and so I drive in my mother’s Honda Civic to the Thirsty Mind in South Hadley and write for a little while pop hits of the summer such as “Mirror” by Justin Timberlake, “I Don’t Care” by Icona Pop, and “Get Lucky” by Daft Punk play and I wonder idly to myself if this is a trend and if people behind the counter at locally-owned coffee places are more and more across the country playing the exact same music every mother and grandfather and ten year old is also listening to while riding in the car and shopping at the Wal-Mart and waiting on hold for the companies to which they owe money and so much of our identity is bound up in environs and ornaments and purchases and so few of these contextual aspects of what we think of as the self go along with the activities that enable a person to grow and change such as study and play and art and so eventually we find ourselves filling our day in a way that precludes self-definition and this reinforces the top-down patriarchal narrative in which he who gets the most people rich is the virtuous one unlike the rest of us slobs and I drive back to Chicopee and end up I don’t know. 119 Rosalyn and I drive to meet Jen and Peter in Easthampton at the Hideaway Lounge in Eastworks. We arrive late because the sunset distracts us and I convince Rosalyn to drive a little bit up Mt Tom so she can have a peek at the view I (being in the passenger’s seat and not needing to keep my eyes on the road) have already been able to take in. At the bar, we all talk about how gentrified Northampton is getting; this is a conversation I am certain people in the Valley have been saying at various points for decades now (usually with some amount of complaint and reminiscence about “the good old days”) but it truly is the case now that a walk through the center of Northampton is no longer a walk through the stomping grounds of subcultures and alternative lifestyles. It is now above all else a place to spend money in comforting ways. “We’ll be moving to Easthampton next year, probably,” Jen and Peter say. Jen and Rosalyn are hits with each other. Jen extends us the offer to meet up with her at the WWII Club, where she’ll be meeting up with some of her fellow teachers. But we decide to go home instead. 120 Speculating some more with Rosalyn about our future together while we go for our nighttime walks. She doesn’t think she’ll be able to do that big months-long repair of her body she was hoping her father would fund before the start of her OT schooling. She is however researching even more her interest in tiny houses (stand-alone structures with limited square footage) and is even wondering (although she admits it’s a long shot) if she could manage to get and customize one to live in while going to OT school. 121 Dr. Sladyk says the latest idea is for me to run the life story group I planned using Bay Path College undergraduates as participants. She says I could do this at some point during the Fall semester. I tell her I’m in favor of this. "

    "body": "1 It feels like I’ve already established a new routine, and I’m barely here yet. But on my first day of fieldwork, having spent several other days driving around and exploring the area, I think I can see what it’s going to be. I’ll leave the affluent Maryland suburb where I’m staying at 7 AM… drive a mile down the road to the Safeway that has a Starbucks inside. Let the GPS guide me down identical-looking roads and highways to my fieldwork site. Park on top of the parking garage that is weirdly distant from the hospital I have to go to. Take the shuttle to the hospital. Take the elevator. Press the buzzer to be let inside the locked ward. Go about my day increasingly taking on the responsibilities of a mental health occupational therapist (evaluating people’s preparedness to return to their life after an inpatient stay, giving them individual pointers and activities and strategies to help them increase their functioning, and running activity and exercise and life skills groups). Either eat a cold dinner I’ve packed, microwave something on my way out, or stop at a restaurant in one of the nearby neighborhoods of Northwest D. C. before heading to a Starbucks and doing the sit-with-a-laptop thing. After rush hour has passed and my dinner is well digested, a drive back into Maryland and a workout at the gym. Then home to shower and go to bed. This I will do for three months. Then I will have three months of mostly the same routine, except with a placement in a long-term care setting instead. Something like that. Maybe. 2 Dec. 31, 2013. While observing an art and music therapy group, watching the woman playing harp (whom I had taken to be a music therapist, although it turns out she is actually an admin who comes up to play instruments once or twice a week), it occurred to me that the idea of being able to improvise on an instrument never appealed to me. I had never liked the idea that something composed on the spot would then just drift away into the ether, unrecorded, unremembered. But it also occurred to me, then, listening to that harp, that my interest in preserving a record of my life is not just some compulsion. I’m not some indiscriminate hoarder of the things I write. I only keep what I need in order to retrace my steps in a coherent narrative, to reinforce my grounding in the present. The written story does the job that family is supposed to do, basically: it tells me that I am still the little boy it remembers so well, and that it is very, very proud of me. While I am still to a large extent adrift, with my loved ones equally adrift and living in different places, my archives of writing are what I go back to for strength, for some echo of what I have to say. I spent Christmas alone, which was actually a pretty good time. I went for a walk through the woods, then saw the very long movie The Wolf of Wall Street. I went to a Denny’s for my dinner. Today is New Year’s Eve, a holiday I actually get more sentimental about. That’s okay, though. I quietly posted another collection of my outsider-y folk songs, which is something I’ve sort of wanted to make an annual tradition since I did the same thing at the end of 2007. Doing things like that help me remember that even in an incredibly busy year, I got things done for myself. 3 The OT I’m working under asks me what I’m doing to process the things I’m hearing and seeing in this internship. “After all,” he says, “You’re hearing these people talk every day about experiences there is no way you could possibly understand, because you haven’t been through it yourself. ” I then have to pretend that the experiences of people who have been devastated by abuse and addiction are more shocking to me than the office banter of my colleagues, who play tennis and live in the suburbs. “I focus on the good,” I say. “In fact, I usually leave feeling really positive at the end of the work day. These patients are getting help, at least. A lot of people never will. ” Indeed, a lot of people I have known personally never will. 4 Jan. 10, 2014. Now I’m at the Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, Maryland. Walking around here reminds me of how when I first went to the King of Prussia Mall in Pennsylvania I felt like it was too high-end for me, even though it was a shopping mall and even though I now find that this mall is quite a bit nicer even than that one was. I think this fieldwork is getting to me. Still, though, the most difficult part to process is not the sight of the eighteen-year-old who has been with us for a couple of weeks following her first psychotic break, whose parents have gradually come to understand that their daughter won’t be going back to college next semester because in fact this delusional her is more likely than not to be the new her. What’s most difficult to process is not the stories of the alcoholics, or of the kids detoxing from heroin, or of the homeless who have learned to work the system to get treatment for illnesses while making sure to avoid being taken off the street and getting medicated into exploitability for the rest of their lives. The most difficult thing to process is the middle class workplace culture, which is an extension of the culture of people I’ve been taking OT classes with. 5 I saw the movie Her. Chatting with Rosalyn later in the night, I saod,: “It’s funny. By the end of the movie I realized I related pretty strongly to Samantha, the operating system. Preoccupied at first with what she’ll never be, then trying anything to bridge the difference. Then finally, painfully, separating herself from the role she was supposed to play and the people who wanted her to play it. ” 6 I tossed and turned, never attaining restful sleep, for most of the four hours between when I closed my laptop and when my alarm went off. I made myself some coffee and cereal for my breakfast at home, which didn’t entirely sate my hunger or caffeine addiction but saved me from spending money on a bagel and coffee. Then another vehicle tried to change lanes and crashed into me on the Beltway, injuring no one but leaving my car in rough enough shape that I was nervous even driving for the ten minutes it took to get it to the parking garage. Over the course of the day my phone battery lost its charge more quickly than I had ever seen it lose charge before, so by the time I was able to leave my fieldwork I had no car to drive and no phone to use to try to secure transportation. My fieldwork supervisor offered to drop me off at a wireless store slightly closer to where I had to go, where I could leave my phone to charge for the half hour that was left before the wireless store closed. My phone still wasn’t keeping much of a charge, but it was functioned for long enough that I was able to make a phone call and request that other phone calls be made to search for anyone who might be able give me a ride. Mary found me and picked me up at the Panera Bread where I was waiting. 7 It’s my fourth and last chance to catch a commuter bus home tonight, and I just looked up and across the street to see the words “BUTCHER BABIES” in flashing orange lights. Thank you, silly metal band name. I needed that tonight. 8 See, though, here’s the thing: improvising my way safely down unfamiliar roads to where I want to be is pretty much both literally and figuratively the story of my life. So these little adventures, unwanted as they are, kind of help me feel like myself again. Plus, when I get to fieldwork, I absolutely have to leave my stressors at the door. They’re meager in comparison to those of the patients I’m assessing, anyway. 9 But by mid-week it’s clear that there are whispers about me. On Friday at my weekly review with Billy he tells me that my goal for the following week will be to “say hello and make eye contact with the other staff” whenever I see them. This followed a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of horrible sleep deprivation. By Friday I felt that I was getting the hang of everything—and there really wasn’t much more to the job than what I started doing this week—but I could not get any supportive or optimistic words out of Billy. Things felt like they were going pretty great until this week. My notes about the actual patient interviews have been innocuous (“Take a little more time to introduce OT, and end the session more clearly. ”) But all I have to do is scrape by here. 10 I email contacts of mine at Bay Path to let them know it’s not clear to me how well I am or am not doing. 11 Rosalyn’s mother had told me in advance that her brother Wally wanted to take us out to eat on Saturday. I had met him once before, at Thanksgiving in 2012. So I got myself ready and drove her and myself to the Cheesecake Factory. Walking in, we noticed a fire truck by the entrance that I usually used to get into the mall—the one by the Sears and Starbucks. “I hope that fire truck’s not for the restaurant we’re going to,” Rosalyn’s mother laughed as a second one pulled up. I pulled on the door to the restaurant. It seemed to be locked. I was going to walk around to find a different door, but one of the restaurant’s employees opened the door for me, and then Wally was shaking my hand and jovially leading us to the hostess and then to our table. “There’s an active shooter,” he said casually. “What? You mean here?” asked Rosalyn’s mother. “I went and bought the movie tickets ahead of time. The guy there had a police scanner app on his phone. He heard that the shooter was down, plus two others. ” Then there was a lot of unrelated conversation I didn’t know how to participate in. Part of this was conversational style and part of this was the fact that all I wanted to do was reach into my pocket and use my phone to tell people that I was okay, since I knew that suburban mall + shooting = news story and that people would be hearing about it. Everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be on edge, with their phones out. The staff kept standing at the window to watch what was happening outside. It felt like the table I was at was the only one acting like this was a completely typical day at the Cheesecake Factory. I sat with better-than-ever posture and nodded and answered questions in concise and articulate detail, but I was quiet. Finally I snuck away to the bathroom and posted to Facebook that there was a shooter but that I was safe. Back at the table. Eventually CNN came on one of the TVs, broadcasting a feed from a helicopter above us. At that point I think the mood in the room either got more solemn or just finally reached our table. The waitress spilled something on Wally’s sleeve. She mentioned that the police had said not to let anyone out. I got more quiet. We ordered dessert, locked there inside the restaurant. Eventually, Rosalyn’s mother and Wally saw that it appeared people were being let into the cinemas again. I had already seen the movie they had bought tickets for, so I left, waited in traffic behind other exiting mall traffic as it was directed by police officers, then made my way down unusually quiet roads. 12 A “leader” is just a follower gone pro. What people really need is supporters. 13 Jan. 30. The feds are seeking the death penalty for the Boston Marathon bomber. Because sending the message that killing is sometimes the ethical thing to do will obviously discourage young men from doing similar things in the future. 14 Feb. 7. Another day, another half dozen new people in the midst of a life-threatening mental health crisis. 15 Feb. 9. I guess I’m feeling better than I’ve been feeling for the rest of the past month. I’m able to drive back and forth from the hospital again, which of course helps by giving me a little more free time, a little more opportunity to get more sleep on certain nights if I feel the need to. Today is Sunday; the past two days I’ve spent at the hospital without Billy supervising me. Yesterday I observed an OT who works one Saturday per month there. On Friday I shadowed one of the psych doctors in the morning, then did a couple of evals independently, then ran a time management group while one of the nurses who also runs groups there on the unit observed me. The day before that (Wednesday) Billy brought me along to a lunch meeting with someone from the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA). We walked there, since the headquarters is only a couple of miles from Suburban Hospital. The meeting was interesting to me at points, specifically when the person we were meeting with talked about OT in community-based mental health centers and what billing looks like there. Other than that, it was an honest-to-goodness D. C. -style networking lunch, the sort Rosalyn has described to me before. After the lunch, Billy said, “I was disappointed that she didn’t offer to pay,” and called the person “scatterbrained”. This was the moment I gave up on liking him. I had felt like he had been awful to me on various occasions, but it’s easy for misunderstandings or moments of accidental rudeness to arise in a supervisor-student relationship, and I had thought that maybe I was exaggerating these moments to myself. I had seen him be dismissive of co-workers too, but sometimes co-workers feel like they have permission to do that; I kind of let that go, too. But this woman had been perfectly pleasant and helpful to him. So, yeah. I’ve given up on doubting myself about my take on this guy. 16 Feb. 22, 2014. At Northside Social, a coffee place in Arlington. I wonder how this town is on weeknights. Once my fieldwork at Suburban is finished and I’ve gone to Massachusetts and back I’ll be doing my second placement at a place in D. C. , and I assume that place will not be extending the length of my work day by making me take any shuttle buses. Maybe that will give me opportunities to go and hang out in places after getting out. (The parking lot by the hospital itself is free to park in on the weekends, which is a large part of why I felt okay about driving to Virginia today. ) At Suburban I am now doing multiple initial evaluations of new patients on my own every day. The usual way we’ve settled into doing things is that I run the game night on Monday, cooking group on Wednesday, and another group on Thursday or Friday. On Wednesday, Gaël is with us. He’s the level I student from Howard University who says he wants to earn his doctorate, become a researcher, and start a national association for occupational therapists in his home country of Cameroon. He spends a lot of time watching me do my evals while Billy takes care of other business. Yesterday things felt a bit contentious as my supposed-to-be-weekly conversation with Billy about my progress as a fieldwork student bled into my watching him go over the powerpoint I’ve put together for a presentation to the other staff in the unit—a presentation he thought looked “great” on Monday but which he now wants to have a different structure. Already the idea for the presentation is his, although he has shown that he wants the presentation to be done under the pretense that the idea (for the unit’s OT groups to begin using “functional task groups” taken from a particular poster presentation once set up by OTs from the Johns Hopkins Hospital at a Maryland Occupational Therapy Association conference) was one I came up with. As the two of us went over the powerpoint slides he let on that one of the authors of this poster and of the series of protocols he is obsessed with is the same OT I’m supposed to go and shadow soon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. I said at one point, “I’ll be sure to ask her to clarify how some of those groups are run in practice,” to which Billy replied, “That’s the only reason you’re going there. ” So, apparently I am meant to bring back information so that Billy (who has all along been painting himself as the hero of the Suburban Hospital psych unit in part by talking disparagingly of the way the previous OT did her job) can then do things just like the people in that hyper-respected medical institution. I found myself even getting short with Billy at times. He had opened up our discussion (which, remember, was ostensibly one of our weekly times set aside to inform me how I’ve been doing) by asking me, without prefacing at all what he was doing, the questions on the evaluation I will be filling out about him at the end of our time working together. Once again he wants to make sure that “there won’t be any surprises” at the end of these twelve weeks when he evaluates me and I evaluate him. "

    "body": "17 Each day, after I leave the unit, I’m thinking to myself that there are things I wish I could have done better—awkward ways I phrased things during a one-on-one evaluation, or decisions made while running a group that left things feeling unstructured. But there are highlights, too. 18 Feb. 26. All these weeks in, I think I’ve figured out how to stop the time demands of this fieldwork experience from taking over my life completely each day. Today is a Wednesday, and after running a good community living skills group while Billy and Gaël sat and watched, I walked to my car—walked to my car—which was in a location I did not need to pay to park at! This was all new and all thanks to Billy’s suggestion of where I could park. Once back at my car, I drove to Arlington again. It didn’t take long or require me to sit in much traffic. I found the Whole Foods, which I needed to find in order to buy some liquid melatonin and other things. Following that, I got halal chicken fingers plus rice at a kabob place. (“With fries?” asked the man behind the counter. “No, rice,” I confirmed. ) Now I will move on to Northside Social, to see what that coffee place looks like on a weeknight. 19 And it still is nice-feeling. That’s good. I’ve been thinking about staying around D. C. while doing the Writing degree thing at Johns Hopkins, and Arlington is feeling surprisingly like the sort of place I might want to stay for that length of time. 20 Feb. 27. Another day at Suburban. Another Thursday, meaning Billy is volunteering at Walter Reed and I take care of business by myself, working with a patient to try to gain some insight on the effects of her newly developing memory problems on her everyday functioning. Then Billy comes back and tells me and Lynne (who shares our office) all about the amazing motion-sensing treadmill-and-screen combat simulator used in rehab there. After lunch he’s telling me to shut myself inside one of the doctor’s offices to write up a protocol for the group he has decided he wants me to run today (because it turns out the food ordered for the salsa-making group isn’t coming). I don’t like trying to write something like this at the workplace; it stresses me out. Next, we split up for some more evals. Mine is with someone I spoke to the last time he was admitted, a mere month ago, and this time he is irritable and telling me that it seems redundant to him to talk about his current life circumstances with anyone new because he has already spoken with one of the doctors about these things. Then I lead the leisure group, which is me setting up a Wii and letting the patients play Wii Sports together, then facilitating some reflection, a chance for everyone to talk about specific leisure interests of their own and what they have done to keep participating in them while being affected by mental illness symptoms. 21 So ends week ten of my twelve week mental health placement, and it was just me working OT with the patients today. I found time for all the treatments and evaluations I wanted to do, had some encouraging responses from the patients, ran a fun therapy group, and left on time. Of course, now, after the intense emotional rollercoaster of learning to do this job and returning to it on a daily basis, I need to begin processing the fact that I won’t be doing it at all anymore in two weeks… 22 Mar. 2. Another snowstorm predicted. Whenever it snows down here it’s a disaster, so I won’t be surprised if I am once again unable to get to fieldwork. How things will be arranged in that case to make sure I meet the required number of hours at this placement I’m not sure. 23 Mar. 3. Yet another snow day. Billy requested that we go over the powerpoint for my upcoming presentation over the phone, and we did. Just when I think my dislike of the guy might be cooling, he keeps on changing the parameters of what he says he wants this presentation to be. I already prepared this thing! And he said that it looked great! Now he keeps telling me to change these individual pieces in ways that I then have to try to make sense, and he rationalizes each change in super condescending ways. When I tell him I’m disheartened, having at his insistence re-shaped this presentation more than once without being given any clear explanation of why, he appeals to the power he has over me. He says, “A large part of what you’ll be graded on at the end of this fieldwork is” whatever skill the latest idea he wants to insert into the presentation is arguably going to strengthen. I ask him if he’ll put down in writing what all of his overall expectations are for this presentation, so that I can then be sure that I am meeting them all. He doesn’t like that suggestion, but he writes down and emails the specific suggestions he has made to me during our phone conversation. 24 Mar. 6. Yesterday was me keeping busy at the hospital, with a full case load and a time management group to run and Gaël on board. Today was extremely quiet, so quiet that I only had one patient to work with individually in addition to the group I ran. The group I ran was focused on home management; it was a modified version of one of the Johns Hopkins groups on which I’m doing my presentation to the unit next week. Rosalyn did not get into the Bay Path OT program, just as she didn’t get into Shenandoah (the one program she applied to anywhere in the vicinity of D. C. ), just as she didn’t get into a program in North Carolina to which she also had applied. She is now formulating her plans for what to do next. I got some disappointing news also, although nothing quite so consequential. My second fieldwork placement was canceled at the last moment, so now I’ll be at a skilled nursing facility in in Montgomery County, Maryland. The other place had seemed really nice, and it would have at least had me finding myself within the limits of DC rather than in Maryland after the end of my shift each day. Oh, well. 25 Mar. 7. Today I met individually with various people at the lowest point in their lives. I had the most serious, personal talks with them you could imagine. Then I brought them together in a room and had them laughing, playing ping pong with each other, all talking with each other about their plans. In your face, cruel world. 26 Mar. 8. A Saturday at the partial hospitalization/intensive outpatient program at Suburban Hospital, which is where a good number of patients go after being discharged from the inpatient unit. Four patients were there. Three of them knew me from inpatient. Patrick, the social worker, showed that he is quite a good group leader. He asked the right questions to get patients talking with each other and working through their issues in constructive ways. At the end of the day Patrick asked me, “What area of work do you want to go into?” I explained that this would depend on what fields I could find appropriate jobs in. “I really like working in mental health,” I say, “But not a lot of mental health settings actually employ OTs. ” “You seem to have a mind for it,” he said. I thanked him. 27 Mar. 13. My supervisor high fives me after my presentation. My response is simply, “It just goes to show that eventually, things happen, and then they’re done. ” 28 Mar. 14. Finished and passed my mental health placement. Yay for entry-level competencies! I’ll be driving up to MA on Sunday for a visit. Then I’ll be back in MD in two weeks to start my next placement. 29 Meeting up with Salma. I’ve been sitting at Haymarket, looking at things on my phone, waiting for her. “Hi, Levi!” she says. “Do you mind if we go to Woodstar instead?” “No, not at all,” I say. “I’ve just about finished my coffee here, anyway. ” At Woodstar she gets a particular bagel sandwich she was having a yen for. She tells me that she was accepted into the Master’s of Social Work program at Westfield State University (previously known as Westfield State College) and that the letter from them had told her to respond with a $150 deposit within ten days of her receipt of the letter, which would mean… today, more or less… and oh, there was the college calling now, and did I mind if she stepped outside for a minute? The guy calling her made certain to drive home the point that they didn’t like when people paid their deposits and then backed out due to being accepted by another school. Salma, being Salma, is really concerned with this, so I’m sure to keep saying, “Hey. If you end up rescinding your acceptance because Boston College or UConn accepts you, you can deal with your guilt then… the guilt that you feel for having paid this school $150. ” I try to get her to drive over to Westfield right then and there to accept, but she insists that she still needs more time to think things over. She does accept their offer the next day, though, and over the phone I give her a big congratulations. 30 Mar. 20. Rosalyn meets up with me while I’m at the Holyoke Barnes &amp; Noble, sitting with a coffee and filling in some of the little gaps in my Life Story from the past few months. She wants to go next door to the Red Robin to get something that’s called, like, an Irish shake or something. We head there and it’s busy—dinnertime—so we just sit at the bar while she drinks it and I get a glass of water. At first we’re going to go back to Chicopee, but as we’re in the parking lot I remember that she previously mentioned the idea of seeing a movie sometime this weekend. So I ask, “Do you want to see what movies are playing?” She says sure. Like me, she has no idea what movies are out right now. We look at the options and decide on Tim’s Vermeer. We drive towards Amherst, call Thai Corner to phone in an order, get to Thai Corner and ask if actually we could eat it there instead, quickly eat the food, then go to see the movie. I see J. Mascis from the band Dinosaur Jr. walking into the theater behind us… which is kind of funny, because one of the last times I was in Amherst with Rosalyn we saw him, too, that time inside the Barnes and Noble cafe and later riding his bike in the parking lot. (He was always a Pioneer Valley staple, anyway, along with the folks in Sonic Youth. ) I get the medium popcorn and end up disgusted with myself for eating pretty much the whole thing during the movie. The movie is interesting, managing to keep me from getting bored despite consisting mostly of footage of a guy painting. Then Rosalyn and I head back to Chicopee, where we again sit down on a futon mattress in what was once (when I alone lived in this in-law apartment) my “Chaos Room”. We watch some episodes of the third season of Girls. 31 Mar. 22. Having Salma over for dinner. Talking about something I’ve talked to her about many times over the years—how much she wants to have children and how much she would be devastated if she ended up not having them. Eric wants to have children, she has told us before, but he has not seemed to want to talk specifically about what a timeline for having kids would look like for them. Rosalyn and I both encourage her to explain to him clearly that it is important to her to get this information from him. 32 A pleasant night at Hugo’s with Rosalyn, Salma, Allison, Eric and his friend and someone else they brought along. 33 Rosalyn takes me out for brunch at Sylvester’s. She makes a suggestion to me: if she moves to Alabama for school and cannot find an appropriate pet-friendly apartment, would I or my mother consider taking responsibility for Kaylee in exchange for forgiveness of that $300 per month I was planning to start paying as recompense for all the financial assistance Rosalyn has been giving me while I’ve been in school? 34 Apr. 5. My earliest impressions were that this placement would be—surprisingly—pretty mellow. The rehab therapists at this facility cut corners, preferring to spend their time laughing and complaining in a mixture of English and Tagalog. When my supervisor, Ruby said to me, “I don’t want to hold your hand. A lot of us here are from the Philippines, and I’m going to train you the Philippines way,” I saw this as a good thing… until the next day, when she seemed to expect me to be able to do her job without even being shown examples of what she does. The rest of the week, I don’t do much. It’s a strange and drastic shift. 35 “I don’t know how it got to be so late!” I say. “I want to go for a walk now, and it’s 11:30 at night. I still think I’m going to go for a very quick walk through the neighborhood, though. ” “Well, you know,” says Rosalyn’s mother, “My friend down the street was outside when some police came by. Apparently, some people called because there was someone walking around who ‘looked like they didn’t belong’. ” “Oh, okay. I guess I won’t go for a walk, then. ” “Sorry. ” 36 I wake up after a night when I finally, finally got some good sleep. (This has seemed impossible, somehow, since I got back here from Massachusetts. ) It’s a relief when I roll over and look at my phone to check the time and see that it’s 5:30 in the morning rather than midnight or something like that. It was an upsetting dream-moment that woke me up, though: a strange one involving being out to eat at a restaurant with Rosalyn, who for some reason had a snake around, and I was trying to get the snake to settle down, but I was only aggravating it, and then Kaylee the chihuahua came running back from wherever she had been, at just the wrong moment, and suddenly she had disappeared, and I was confusedly exclaiming, “I think he ate Kaylee! I think he ate Kaylee!” Which led to me lying awake in my bed, then, in the dark and with my eyes closed, just straight pantsless instead of wearing the sweatpants I usually have been wearing to bed, reflecting on death and loss and how I sometimes think I’m more disposed to deal well with that sort of thing because my emotions have adapted to the transitory nature of all kindness and all cruelty, of all those I meet, of all the kind and unkind visitors to my life. But in that moment in the dream, I wasn’t prepared to lose that dog, and it hurt. 37 I’m getting used to acting with my new supervisor, Ruby, in a way that is nearly opposite of how I had to try to act with my previous one, Billy. Billy explicitly kept pushing me to make more eye contact and to build relationships with my co-workers. Ruby wants to bother with me as little as possible. Unfortunately, she also makes it hard for me to suss out how she wants me to run the evaluations and so on, since she doesn’t really allow for questions and usually refuses to show me examples of how to do things. She ends up instead sitting across from me, going on digressions about the importance of documenting this-and-that and that-and-this, sounding to me as if she is chiding a son who has repeatedly made dangerous and terrible mistakes. “So I documented that part correctly?” I’ll ask. “Yes, you wrote that down fine. ” 38 If southern stereotypes about the north and northern stereotypes about the south had a baby and left it with a gigantic trust fund, I’m pretty sure that baby would be Maryland. 39 Salma calls while I’m writing at the mall. She talks for a long time about how she has told Eric that she would like him to propose marriage before the two of them move in together. Her biological clock is still ticking, and she wants babies, and she is even thinking seriously about trying to have one on her own if he is unwilling to move in accordance with an an acceptable timetable. 40 The arm breaks off from my glasses as I’m getting into my car after another day at the facility. Fortunately, I can still balance them on my nose well enough for them to stay functional. So, for things like driving I can still use them. Still, a weird thought enters my head. Already in the day I had felt what I feared was tooth pain in one of my upper left molars. Could I be finding myself in another stretch of bad luck in which things in my life fall apart? "

    "body": "41 I get a phone call. It’s the fieldwork coordinator at Bay Path College, calling me to say that she had a conversation with my supervisor and the director of rehab earlier in the day and that they said they’ve found me to be unprepared for the setting. She asks me how I’m feeling about the matter. “I have no concerns about my ability to meet expectations in this type of setting,” I say. “So if they’re calling you to say these things, that’s… terrible. ” “I’m willing to have you withdraw if you want to. If you’d like to stay on with them, I could arrange for a conversation to work out a plan. I want to assure you that they both want you to succeed. ” “I… think that if they’re talking to you at this point, I couldn’t trust that they would be putting in a good faith effort to keep me through the twelve weeks. ” When she asks me where I will want the fieldwork office to look for my new placement, I start crying. It is the first time I can remember crying out of sadness in at least a decade. “I think I’ll be moving back to Massachusetts,” I say. “I don’t know what I’ll have to do to make this work financially. ” She recommends that I go in the next day and formally end my time at ManorCare. She says that she’ll send me an email the next day also, hopefully with some information about how things look regarding possible replacement fieldwork settings. Rosalyn isn’t online, so I call her and ask her to log in to gchat. There I tell her what is going on. I tell her my feeling is that I’ll end up coming back to western Massachusetts in short order, since I have already been so worried about running out of money that I was about ready to apply to be a Domino’s driver in some Maryland town I didn’t know. She says fine but recommends that I set up my own separate space in the living room so that we aren’t stepping on each other’s toes or whatever. I’m like, fine. Then she asks me to help her find pre-req classes. She is expecting to stay in Massachusetts for another year, and she has made special arrangements to interview early for a couple of programs for possible admission in the Fall semester of 2015. So I poke around college web sites for her and let her know what I find. The uncomfortable little bed feels a little less comfortable as I sleep that night. In the morning I wake up, drive to the facility, and stand over Ruby, who as usual doesn’t look at me while she pretends to be doing something important. She makes me wait for about fifteen minutes, then tells me that Paul (the rehab director) will not be in for another hour. So I go get a coffee, come back, and sit reading my NBCOT exam study guide for a half hour. Ruby tells me then that Paul will be in a meeting for another hour, so I go and walk in the nearest mall. Then I come back and we have a boring conversation and I leave my name badge (which was somebody else’s badge that had a sticker placed over the name) and I leave and I drive back to Columbia, and at the Mall in Columbia I read a status update Allison posts about another friend of hers killing himself, just as I’m walking past the site where a guy recently murdered two skate shop employees, then fired some other shots, then took his own life while Rosalyn’s mother and I were on our way to the Cheesecake Factory and planning to see a movie. And then I buy a sandwich at the sub place—this is the last one I have to pay for before I can turn in my hole-punched cards for a free meal—and I eat it and I stand in line at the Starbucks for about twenty seconds before changing my mind and walking out and then going to Centennial Park and walking around the lake twice and then going back to the house and napping in the uncomfortable little bed and getting an email from the fieldwork coordinator asking where I want to be. I say that I want to be placed in western Massachusetts but that if it’s unlikely that can be done in the next few weeks I could do a placement down here. And then I remember that I got charged again for a web domain that I was certain I had canceled and that that has overdrawn my Bank of America checking account and that moreover my debit card for that bank is missing and so I’ve been trying to get to a branch during banking hours but banking hours are basically the same hours I’ve been at fieldwork. So I change out of the shorts I’ve been napping in and back into my black pants. Now I’m again in the all black outfit I’ve been able to wear after pulling off my khaki-colored scrubs at the end of each day. I go to Bank of America, then the local Starbucks on Dobbin Road. I sit in the corner there, typing. 42 On April 17, 2014, I wake up and shower and finish styling my hair (in the bathroom that has been my dedicated bathroom, down the hall and reasonably private) just in time to hear Champion, the dog, barking to announce the arrival of someone at the door. It’s one of Rosalyn’s mother’s friends; I remember it being mentioned that she was going to come over today. I manage to sneak out the door without seeing anyone. This is my preferred way to start any day, of course, but it especially is my preferred way to start a day on which, as far as Rosalyn’s mother knows, I should be at my fieldwork placement down in Montgomery County. I go to the mall, eat some tacos, then start driving and decide to go to Baltimore to hang out around the JHU Homewood campus. I’m at the Barnes &amp; Noble there for a while, trying again to get my Life Story fully polished up through the present, and then I’m walking around for a bit, including around the campus itself. I look around, identifying at least one building in which I took classes six years ago. I find myself thinking that maybe, just maybe instead of having to drive down from Philly for two days out of each week this coming fall, I might enjoy Baltimore well enough if I lived here, right by campus. I could see it being a good environment for book-writing over the course of the sixteen months or whatever I am planning to spend finishing that M. A. in Writing. Maybe I should do that, and maybe I should explain to people that even though I still plan to keep moving around to different locations, I at least want to be in just one place for the present time rather than sort of living in two cities at once. After all, it’s not like it was thrilling to me to drive back and forth all the time the way I did when I was taking classes down here and living with Arden in North Wales, Pennsylvania. The thoughts I have about what I should become next are varied. The questions I have to ask myself include: Where do I want to be? Do I always want to wander? Do I want to have two home bases? What kinds of relationships do I aspire to have? A conventional marriage? An open marriage? No marriage? What do I want my community to be? What do I wish to identify myself as professionally? Here are some things I know: I know that I don’t fit well into a role that requires me to convince others of my competence. You can see the evidence of this in what has just happened to me at this ManorCare placement. I also know that my drive to live an artist’s life has never disappeared and almost certainly never will disappear. Like the person whose suburban-domestic heart brings them out of the city and to PTA meetings eventually, I know that I will always want to escape any situation that does not place me among those in the creative class, at least socially. I also know that I attract the best people when I am being audacious and doing what I want to do with my life. So I probably should just refuse to plan for love, refuse to consider what would put me in the best position to find any particular type of relationship. I should probably try to be happy alone, plan my life accordingly, and not be steered off-track. But of course, I also want to avoid isolating myself. And I’m a human being, so I want to be able to continue to feel that I am demonstrably good and desirable. 43 After turning in my punch card (“buy 7, get 1 free”) at the sandwich place at the mall, I go back to Rosalyn’s mother’s place and tell her that my fieldwork site backed out on me. I leave out the parts about them calling me unprepared and so forth. I just say that they didn’t understand what taking in a student really entailed. “So, I’m going to start packing now,” I say, “And since it’s my birthday coming up in a few days, I’d rather head back up to Massachusetts. I still don’t know if my school is going to set me up with a place up there or down here, but either way, I think I’ll head up north either today or tomorrow. ” Then I go into the bedroom and call my own mother, who is up in Montague, Massachusetts, at my aunt Brenda’s place—helping, she says, with Meme’s preparations for the Easter holiday. (“You got sick of being in Chicopee again?” I ask. “Yes,” she answers back. ) The packing goes quickly, so I text Rosalyn to let her know that I’ll be driving up, with an anticipated arrival time of around 1:30 in the morning. It takes me seemingly forever to get out of Maryland on this Good Friday, but after that the trip isn’t bad. I’ve brought more on this trip than I would bring for a stay of definite length, but I also have left a lot down there in Columbia. I’m not really sure where I live right now, although, to some extent, I hardly ever really do. Kaylee is ecstatic to see me. No one is downstairs, with my mother away and Bruce at work for the overnight shift driving trucks or working the docks or whatever he is doing for the shipping company these days. Rosalyn is kind, and it’s good to see her, and she right away hands me a cup of the kombucha she has been culturing or whatever for herself since I left the house in December. 44 Rosalyn and I are comfortably sharing the bed. Hugging, not kissing. 45 My birthday happens. Rosalyn and I go out and eat. There is no real reflection, and all throughout I barely remember that I have turned thirty-three years old. 46 Rosalyn and I seem better able to share our space now, in her configuration of the apartment, and without worries that our relationship is missing important things (because we aren’t in a relationship of that sort anymore). 47 [Reflection of my fieldwork withdrawal, written for Bay Path] “Most of us here were trained in the Philippines,” said my supervisor, Ruby, on my first day as a student at ManorCare. “We’re going to train you the Philippines way. I’m not going to hold your hand. I’m going to be giving you patients starting tomorrow. ” “That sounds great,” I said. I knew that I didn’t want to go through a prolonged training process. I usually performed best when I had clear responsibilities and the freedom to manage my own time. I came back from that first day feeling relaxed, if uninspired. I had expected that a placement like this would be fast-paced and demanding, especially compared to the psych placement I had just finished. Much to my surprise, however, the therapists in the rehab gym at this placement seemed to be accustomed to having a lot of down time. The same interventions (e. g. , theraband exercises and peg boards) tended to be repeated for most patients. It didn’t look much like the kind of OT I had been hoping to do in this setting, but I thought I would be able to meet the expectations of this placement rather quickly. On the morning of my second day, Ruby printed out a schedule assigning me four patients, including one patient evaluation. She said that she wanted to watch me perform the evaluation to be sure I knew what I was doing. She said that if she felt comfortable with it, I would then treat the other patients on my own. I asked if I could watch her give an evaluation before trying to give one myself. She said that the classes in my OT program should have taught me the proper way to give an evaluation. I had not been given a chance to review completed examples of the documentation or to ask questions about the evaluation process, so while we were in the patient’s room I asked Ruby questions. She told me to begin by assessing the patient’s range of motion. I asked whether we had a goniometer. She said no. I asked how I should be documenting the range of motion on the paperwork if not in degrees. She did not answer. She quickly assessed the patient’s range of motion and muscle strength, then, and told me to wheel the patient’s chair to the rehab gym. This was the closest to an occupational therapy evaluation I watched anyone do during my eleven days at this facility. For the next week and a half, I did not have patients assigned to me. Typically, throughout the morning I would be directed to transport specific patients into the gym and to do certain interventions with them. Rarely did I work with a patient for all of his or her daily OT. More commonly, after completing a round of exercises with one patient I would be told to work with a different patient or I would be sent to transport someone else. The gym tended to be as empty in the afternoon as it was crowded in the morning. Usually, after lunch I would be left to sit and study my NBCOT exam materials. My supervisor was often ignoring me. It was uncomfortable. I silently thought to myself that if she had been hoping for a student to take over her responsibilities quickly, it was strange that she was now having me do so little. Still, even if this experience of taking on a student was not what she had been expecting, I did not think that she would wish to back out of her obligations as a clinical instructor. She eventually allowed me to evaluate patients and to work with them on not just the more basic therapeutic exercises or grooming ADLs but also things like transfer training. Despite limited interaction between my supervisor and me, I had no worries about continuing to learn the work of a therapist in this setting. As recently as one day before I learned that my supervisor and her rehab director wanted me to withdraw, I was telling people my placement was going fine. Since leaving there, I have struggled to process and learn from the experience and how it ended. The attitudes toward therapy practice I saw displayed at this facility very much in contrast to those of my instructors at Bay Path and the other occupational therapists I have worked with or met. It was clear that the facility brings in students to lessen the demand on the employed therapists: the decision to bring in an OT from another ManorCare location for PRN shifts was explicitly made based on my perceived inability to handle a caseload during my second week as a student there. I have read both Bay Path’s and AOTA’s written materials related to student fieldwork experiences multiple times, and I know that Ruby did not demonstrate an effort made to meet the responsibilities of a clinical instructor. My experiences with patient interventions in this setting showed me some examples of what a therapist in an inpatient physical disabilities setting should be able to do confidently. I will try to take the most I can from these observations. I will continue to review and practice assessment techniques and interventions as I have seen them done. Hopefully, this will serve me well in my new placement. 48 The weather takes a turn for the rainy. Rosalyn’s work week starts up again tomorrow, and she feels like making this a quiet, inside, private day. So, we each have been hiding out in our separate spaces. 49 Getting back to the apartment after another of my long walks around Chicopee, I find a voice mail from the fieldwork coordinator. She is saying that they have a placement for me in the town of Hampden, that I should hopefully be able to start soon, and that I should call her back for more information at my earliest convenience. When I return her call, she thanks me for getting back to her so quickly. “I’m just reading your reflection now,” she tells me. “That was quite an experience you had there. ” I don’t know what to say in response to this… to the extent that she thinks the line may have disconnected: “Are you there?” “Yes!” I say. “Yes, it was an experience. ” “Maybe in a way it’s best that it ended the way it did. But anyway, yes, the site in Hampden is where I used to work, in fact. ” She talks to me a little bit about the placement and gives me the name and number of the contact to speak with to set up a visit/interview. 50 I stop in the restroom at the Hampshire Mall in Hadley, Massachusetts. Standing at the sink, I am struck by the memory that this is the same spot where I used to stand at the sink as a little boy next to my father in the 1980s. I am struck by the thought that I used to have to reach up and over to turn the faucet on the sink instead of reaching down and leaning over as I, at six feet tall, need to do now. 	But sentiments like these are dishonest, in a way. Everything has been redone in this bathroom since that long ago time. The sinks are different. The mirrors are different. The floor and the walls are different. Even the air is different, and differently filtered. The climate is different. And the planet has been hurtling through space for all these years, anyway. Place is ephemeral when you really break it down; it’s a line we draw between present experiences and our ideas of the past. So I dry my hands and get on with my day. 51 I was walking both in and around the Hampshire Mall while my car was getting an oil change at the Jiffy Lube across the street. After paying for the oil change I decide to make a quit stop at Whole Foods (since I’m right there) for some coffee and wine. While I am trying to decide on a lane to check out in I see Allison standing in line with her own groceries. Somehow, and ridiculously, I am too nervous to just stand behind her and say hello, so I walk by her and go into a different checkout lane. I at least stop when I see her in line, to try to gauge whether maybe she is just about finished, or what. We don’t actually make eye contact, and she still seems to be engrossed in the process of being cashed out, so I stand back. After a second of standing around in what feels like an awkward, high-traffic spot, I decide to wait outside the doors of the Whole Foods for when she comes out. A few minutes pass and she doesn’t exit, though, so I just send her a text good-naturedly inquiring what she was getting at the Whole Foods. By the time she responds I have already gone to Atkins Farms and picked up some bottles of ginger ale there, but I agree when she proposes that we grab a beer in Northampton. "

    "body": "52 Wheel of Fortune has just ended when Allison gets to Ye Olde Watering Hole. I already have my beer but have only taken a few sips from it. When Allison comes in and takes off her hoodie and rainbow scarf, I find that I am commenting on multiple layers of her apparel. I remark that this always seems to happen, that seeing her on any given day will probably first involve being struck by the various awesome bits of clothing on her. She orders her beer; she gets something from The People’s Pint, whereas I have something from Tröeg’s. Before our conversation can really advance beyond hello and look what you are wearing, though, Jeopardy! has come on, Allison has pointed to it in interest, and in fact several others have gathered at our corner of the bar to watch the game show. During one of the commercial breaks, I mention the thought I had had while watching Wheel of Fortune and waiting for her to arrive—that someone should open up a game show bar, one that always has a game show on the television and that has nightly trivia games. “I think that’s actually a really good idea,” she says. Jeopardy! ends and is replaced on the television by some sporting event, so we hop over next door to Hugo’s for our next beer. Allison gets something from Berkshire Brewing Company, I think, while I order a Sierra Nevada. The Sierra Nevada tap runs out as the bartender tries to pour my glass, though. “That would happen, though, that the beer you ordered would be the one that ran out,” says Allison. “Why?” I ask. “Do you think I tend to have bad luck?” “Well, not necessarily bad luck. But it would happen to you, definitely. That’s just your life story. Well… not your Life Story. ” (Allison has spent some time flipping through printed drafts of this. ) “But I have a lot of luck, I guess?” “I guess. It’s just, in the sitcom of your life, these are the things that we’d see happening to you. You order a beer, but first the keg has to be replaced. ” 53 Later in the night, Allison returns to the idea of my life as a sitcom. In the spirit of banter I ask her, “Yeah, but how would we pitch that series to the network, though?” “Like Seinfeld,” she says. “Only gayer and sadder. ” And we crack up. 54 We talk about heading down to Philadelphia some weekend for the long-awaited reunion of the Misterio Collective we have been wanting to make happen. We allude to plans for fleeing the country. Neither of us are any good at playing billiards, but play we do at Hugo’s, where such games are free on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Rosalyn says that she has been out running some errands and that she just ate out at Red Robin. She asks if she would be welcome to join up with me and Allison. I tell her to come on out, and she does, and the three of us manage to sort of find a way to make a three-person game of pool work. 55 I had read on Facebook that someone or some group had received approval to paint the crosswalk stretching across Main Street from near the front of Thorne’s Marketplace in rainbow colors… but I didn’t know that its painting was imminent. It is a pleasant surprise, then, to see that particular crosswalk—which I am certain I have crossed more times than any other—in not only the mandated white, but also the red, yellow, orange, green, blue, and purple of the LGBT pride flag. 56 I’m better at being an adult than acting like one. If being an adult means that you take responsibility for the challenges of survival and that you do your best to learn to thrive in the context you’re born into, then I’ve actually got some pretty kick-ass adult-being skills. Acting like an adult, though, is its own sort of challenge. It’s a tricky balance to strike—probably no less difficult than being a teenager and attempting to seem “cool” to a social clique that you’re not convinced would ever welcome you in. I have all but finished a Master’s degree in Occupational Therapy now. All I have left is one more three-month-long placement in a work setting. With that done I’ll be able to sit for the certification exam to become a practicing therapist. All signs point to there being very good employment prospects for a newly-graduated OT. Assuming that I make it to that point, I do not expect finding a job to be difficult. The pay should be good. Today I went to take a tour of the facility in Hampden, Massachusetts that the fieldwork coordinator told me she thought could have me start soon. It seemed like a setting I would be happy to spend the next twelve weeks in (a facility with mostly dementia patients) but as my conversation with the OT/rehab director came to an end and I expected to hear about a start date, she seemed strangely cold and said something about not being certain that she could get the okay to take a student but that she would find out and that I could expect to know within the next couple of days “either way”. It really brought down my mood on this already prohibitively cold and rainy final day of April. 57 Via text, Rosalyn suggested that I meet her at the mall. She was shopping—not something she does often. While eating at Fitzwilly’s in Northampton, then walking around town through slight rain, then sitting in her car next to where my own car was parked in the lot outside the mall, I kept bringing us back to talking about me, what might be wrong with how I come across to certain types of people, and what strategies I might try to use to keep myself from having other health care professionals hate me in the future. I thank her for suggesting the trick of keeping in mind something you like about a person when you’re talking with them. I know that my mind tends to function on something like five channels at once; in more safe settings this allows me to be clever and curiously eccentric, but in formal ones (which always feel cutthroat to me) it’s more like four of my channels are saying to themselves, “Be normal! Be normal! Be normal! Be normal!” while the last one handles the dull type of conversation one tends to have in these settings. 58 I’ve set up the insulated second-floor porch of this, the in-law apartment of my mother’s house in Chicopee, so that it is a bit of a small office connected to my and Rosalyn’s main living space. Tonight, Rosalyn follows me out there as I go in to grab something. I direct her attention, then, to the top shelf of one of the bookshelves, where I’ve placed my Associate’s degree from Greenfield Community College (in Liberal Studies) and my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (in English). “As you can see,” I say, “I’m still waiting to find out how many college degrees I have to get before I can afford to frame them all. ” The third degree should in theory be mine soon from Bay Path College, but so many nearly-unheard-of things have already complicated my attempt to become an occupational therapist that this milestone is not a thing I am fully ready to count on yet. 59 In the evening as I let Kaylee out into the yard for a bit and then feed her her dinner, I begin feeling uneasy in the stomach and inclined to lie down. “Do you want to take a nap?” I ask the little white long-haired chihuahua, to whom I am always sickeningly sweet. With her next to me I sleep for maybe a half hour or an hour before I wake up certain that I am hurting and knowing that I am likely facing some food-poisoning-like symptoms. So begins a period of about thirty-six hours during which I pretty much keep sleeping for four hours at a time, then drinking some water, then eating a cracker or a couple of grapes, then feeling that I have to sleep just to handle the process of digesting that tiny amount of food and water. (This is not to go into the specifics of what was meanwhile happening with my bowels. ) After these thirty-six hours, it takes me about another full day to go back to feeling mostly normal. 60 It is past workday hours on Wednesday, May 7, 2014—a full week since I went to that facility in Hampden—and I have still heard nothing about that or any other possible fieldwork placement. Rather than dwelling on all that, I have been doing as much walking as possible—I even hiked up Bare Mountain and followed the path for a bit up there in the Mount Holyoke range—and I have been speeding through my latest full revision of the Life Story. While I sit at the Thirsty Mind in South Hadley, Allison responds to a text message from yesterday. She wasn’t with her phone when I sent it, but tonight she would be up to hanging out. 61 First we eat at La Veracruzana, where we talk a little bit about relationships and dating. “How long did you date Sam?” I ask, referring to the guy I met when we went to that burlesque night at the Deuce. “About six months,” she says. “Longer than usual for me. ” Learning about Allison’s ongoing long-distance relationship and hearing her talk about how things ended with Sam are giving me a sort of peek into her dating habits that I never really had before. I try asking her about how she files different relationships in her brain to distinguish, say, casual dating from a serious relationship, and whether a long-distance relationship is different to her, things like that. She seems prepared to attack the idea that compartmentalizing should be necessary, although of course I am not making and probably never would make such a claim. I don’t feel like I’ve been given much of an answer before she has turned the question around on me: “How do you compartmentalize, Levi?” (Allison often says people’s names while addressing them. ) I tell her that I am rather certain I compartmentalize less than most people. I say that as someone without much family to feel close with… (I say this without stopping to think that the words I say about myself here likely would apply to her just as well) …I’m looking more for family-like connections with people than anything else. “Mmm. But if what you’re looking for is more like family, what about when you have sex with people, then?” “Well, because I don’t have any actual siblings, I guess, it’s not like I’m trying to recreate any existing dynamic. I’m just trying to have the sort of close relationships that can endure almost no matter what. ” After we’ve finished our Mexican food, we go next door to the Dirty Truth. (We consider exploring drink options at places that are farther away, but my right ankle is hurting me, probably due to my hiking up a mountain the previous day, so we stick to what is close by. ) “There aren’t as many queers here as they usually are,” she comments, looking around in the dark and fairly busy beer bar. “Oh, really?” I say. “I don’t usually notice one way or the other in this town. ” “I do,” she says. “There are so many around most of the time. I love it. ” 62 I still haven’t received much specific information, but I am apparently beginning my second and final clinical placement this coming Monday. The graduation ceremony was this past weekend, although none of my peers have finished their placements yet. I was not present because I had already RSVP’d in the negative months before, expecting to be in Maryland at the time. I kind of dislike formal events in general, anyway. I don’t regret spending the day at the cinema seeing Only Lovers Left Alive instead. Especially because the movie was amazing. 63 I dream pleasant dreams about sitting outside with strong coffee in Geneva, gazing at mountains under gray skies. (I’ve never been to Europe. ) Then I’m finding myself roused by some more pain in my right ankle. (Hopefully the new footwear I picked up yesterday will make a difference as whatever this is heals. ) It’s 5:30. My plan was to get up at 6:30, because I like to have some time to relax into consciousness in the morning and Rosalyn’s mother is flying in from D. C. at 9:00. We’re planning to leave for the airport in Hartford at 8:00. Kaylee the chihuahua looks at me nervously when I stand up. She adores me, but still she appears to think that I might snap one of these days and out of nowhere decide to attack and eat her and Rosalyn while they sleep. Rosalyn’s mother has been knowingly living with advanced but slow-moving cancer for a number of years now. I helped her to plan out this trip, during which we’ll be driving to Burlington and leaving her there so that she can attend her son’s/Rosalyn’s brother’s graduation. Rosalyn is my ex-girlfriend, although as far as our families are concerned we’re still together. We’re still more kind and more functional in our coexistence than most couples, I suppose. Kindness and pragmatism are what we always shared, while things like interpersonal chemistry and hobbies and sense of humor we never did. It’s not Switzerland, but it’s a comfortably damp morning I’ve stepped into when I actually do get that cup of strong coffee. 64 I spend much of the afternoon napping while Rosalyn and her mother are out. Soon we’ll be driving north into Vermont. I’m tagging along to keep Rosalyn company on the drive back, and also because weekend trips and I get along well. I’m the sort of person who stays in a more or less constant state of boredom with wherever he happens to be living, who feels uneasy whenever waitstaff or coffee shop employees begin to know his name. So I’ll happily sit in a car for a few hours if it means that at some point I’ll get dropped off in a town center I don’t usually go to, along with a book and a notebook and my seventy gazillion gigabyte iPod, to do nothing in particular for a while. 65 The forested hills and mountains of New England happen to be a lovely shade of light green at this point, following a long and cold winter and, more recently, what has felt like a long stretch of damp, drizzy, and sometimes downright rainy days. This is a good time for a visitor coming from the mid-Atlantic, where there are four seasons, yes, but the difference in appearance of the landscape does not vary quite so much from month to month. This is the start of the span of time when, as Rosalyn has put it, New England becomes a Garden of Eden, but just for a little while. Rosalyn, her visiting mother and I stop in Brattleboro for food. This takes us kind of a long time: I am one who is usually content to shovel food in my mouth in the most expedient and cost-efficient way possible, but Rosalyn is not, and I don’t think her mother is, either. So, we wait thirty minutes for a table at what I can only assume is the only place in southern Vermont where anyone would have to wait for a table. (And after all that what we order is salad and pizza. ) But I like the restaurant, still, and I’m having a fine time. 66 My spirit (so to speak) has felt a little bit lonely these past couple of years. But Rosalyn was also perhaps the first person in my life I ever met who both believed in me and was in a position to help me get through some of the meaningful challenges I am in the habit of setting for myself in life. I’m happy to remain an ally and to do what I can to return her favors. Even if her collection of travel music consists almost exclusively of bands from the ‘90s that I never really much cared for. 67 I’m in a poor mood in the morning. Maybe in part because I woke up from dreams about Morrissey—that couldn’t have helped—but also because I just find sitting at a hotel continental breakfast an unpleasant way to start the day. Between figuring out what’s available and what all the food is, trying to convince myself that that bagel doesn’t taste so bad, trying to tune out the stimulus of families all around me, and most importantly finding the coffee to be far too weak for my tastes, the monster I am when I first wake up has a difficult time being soothed. (Of course, “monster” is relative. If anyone notices my staring blankly in vague displeasure this morning, they don’t mention it. ) 68 Rosalyn: “Thank you for coming with me. ” Me: “You’re welcome. I’m glad my presence could be more positive than negative. ” “Yes. I love traveling with you. ” “Why is that?” “You nudge me outside of my comfort zone. ” “How?” “With your ideas and suggestions about trying different things. I’m interested, but I also have anxiety about doing things I haven’t done before. You keep leading me to different towns, different restaurants, different things to do. ” In some respects, when I think about my personality, I feel like an old man who has seen it all, who knows what he believes and what he values in life and is ready to state it all curtly, bluntly, and impolitically. But in other respects I feel like a manic pixie dream boy. All of this fits with my uncertainty about the sort of life I ultimately would like to live. Part of me wants to be like Unico, the central character of that random anime I had on tape as a child. Unico is a little pink unicorn who touches the hearts of any monster he meets; he can help even the most hurt and angry creature find kindness underneath their anger and fear. But even as he establishes close and true friendships with all he meets, he must ultimately be carried away by his ally the West Wind. The gods don’t want him to have the power that he has, so they would prefer to see him banished to solitude. That’s the existence that seems to fit best with the life I have lived since I was a teenager… being Unico. But another part of me feels that I want to transcend the roles that are familiar to me. That’s the ambitious part of me—the part that has seemingly turned me upwardly mobile at a time when most Americans in my age cohort cannot duplicate the standard of living their parents had. It’s the part of me that actually might want to be responsible for children at some point, if only just because I think I could do that better than many others and because, like, I dunno… I might get bored with the other projects there are to be pursued in the latter half of an average twenty-first century lifespan. I feel pretty confident in the super-ambitious five year plan I have written up for myself to follow the completion of this Master’s degree. But I’m already spending a lot of time stewing over the question of where I want to go after all that. Do I go the bohemian route, or do I try to beat “normal” living at its own game? "

    "body": "69 I wake up before five in the morning on Monday for my first day at my next clinical affiliation. The difference between this long-term-care place and the one I had to withdraw from in Maryland seems pretty huge so far. It looks like I will be able to progressively take over the responsibilities of the supervising therapist while receiving guidance and asking questions—which is what a clinical affiliation/fieldwork/whatever you want to call it is supposed to be. 70 “You know, you’ll always be welcome in my home, whatever and wherever that home may be,” said Rosalyn to me at some point recently. “Thank you,” I said. “Same to you. ” “And that includes if anything ever happened and you fell on hard times and you needed to get back on your feet,” she adds. “I know you’ve always been afraid of having your life fall apart and having nowhere to go. But so long as I have the space to offer, you’ll always be welcome to stay with me if you need to for a reasonable length of time. ” It’s that sort of found-family connection and dedication I have always tried to develop in my close friendships. A question that I need to ask myself now is, How do I nurture a connection like that once it has been established? And how do I represent it to the rest of society? What limits do I, for my part, set on it? Rosalyn was hoping for something with me that would be a Relationship with a capital r, at least nominally. She knew she wanted (and she still wants) to keep her polyamorous lifestyle. She felt (and still feels) secure in her secondary relationship with (the happily married) Chris. In that context it seemed like she was willing to date me on any terms at all so long as she was able to call me her partner. (She still wanted to be with me even if we were planning never to live together, not even committing to stay in the same city, and not being sexual with each other. The difference between close friendship and that sort of Relationship would have been, in her view, the romance. ) I’m certain that she and I will soon have further conversations about what we are and will be to each other. We’re living together for the next three months, we have been sharing a bed chastely, and we know that we’ll be involved in each other’s lives for at least the next couple of years. I do feel that I should have a more clear view of how I would wish her to fit into my life before I initiate a conversation. I have too many mixed feelings at present. It seems that Julian too still wants to keep me in his life unconditionally, after all these years, even as he has been living so far away (first in Indianapolis, now in Portland, Oregon). When he and I lived in the same area I ended up intimidated by and in some ways offended by his fixation on me (after he initially sort of broke my heart). Those were nights of the two of us hanging out in the bars and clubs of Northampton, Massachusetts, singing karaoke, or else just wandering the town during the day. (“Would you like some of my coffee?” I would offer in all seriousness. “I don’t drink coffee! I still don’t drink coffee!” he would exclaim. ) He is someone else I can imagine staying in my life forever. He is also someone else I could imagine having many different types of relationships with. Completing the trio of closest friends I have in this world is Salma, who will probably stay in Massachusetts long after I leave again, if she indeed makes babies with her boyfriend. With Salma I have a clear-cut type of relationship. It is (as they say) a platonic friendship, pretty much like those she has with her female friends (except that I don’t get invited to the hot tub parties). The only blood relation I feel any loyalty to is my mother, and even my relationship with her is emotionally distant. And in the future I expect that I will be out exploring the world, while she will be inside keeping away from it. And that’s fine. Is this what family looks like in my case? I have to ask myself how I want to manage these connections, and what other relationships I might want, and how it all connects to the other things I want to pay attention to in my life. 71 Rosalyn’s friend Emilie is visiting for the weekend from Brooklyn. I get out early from my fieldwork on Friday, so I call and am informed that they’re eating at Red Robin, that chain restaurant Rosalyn has been going to a lot. I join them and we chat. After the meal they head to the pet store while I stop at home and let the dog out and change out of my work clothes (khakis and black polo shirt) into an all-black outfit. They swing by and pick me up and we go to get complicated flavors of soft serve ice cream. (After all, this is meant to be a fun visit for Emilie. ) Then we are driving to see X-Men: Days of Future Past. While I sit in the back, the two of them have been talking. “My father used to throw away my things if I didn’t keep them properly immaculate,” Rosalyn says. “Oh my God,” says Emilie. “I can’t imagine having to try to keep a car up to your father’s standards. Your father is so intimidating. ” “Even after I was outside of his authority, I definitely found myself for a while kicking my shoes clean outside the car before I would dare to bring my legs inside,” says Rosalyn. “Levi, have you met her father?” Emilie asks. “I have,” I say. “A couple of times. ” “And did he scare the hell out of you?” “No, he was fine to me,” I say. “My father just about thought that I shouldn’t have been born,” Rosalyn says. “He’s the sort of person who always believed that people who didn’t meet certain standards of ability should be locked away. And that meant people up to and almost including my level of ability. He really had no patience or sympathy for people who didn’t meet a certain standard. ” I jump in: “And this standard was based on what were his own strengths and what he did well, I imagine. ” “Basically,” Rosalyn says. “But he also always held a low opinion of what he did, too. He has never felt that he has accomplished much at all. ” And we find our way to the Hampshire Mall in the small farm town of Hadley, and we see the X-Men movie, and the X-Men movie is good. 72 After an afternoon of much solitary walking (on the bike trails and such) I have located Allison in Northampton, as arranged. She has asked me some strange question, which maybe was a reference to something I said earlier on the phone but which she misunderstood? Or something? Anyway, the question is something like, “So, what bad thing happened to you today?” And the true answer is nothing—the day has been just fine—but for the sake of banter I start improvising a story along the lines of, “Well, I woke up underwater. That was pretty bad. So I started swimming, swimming, trying to find the surface…” She keeps nodding and going, “Uh huh. And?” until I have finished making up my stupid tale. Before long we have walked up Pleasant Street to its intersection with Main, and I’m leaning against the wall next to the ATM while Allison is withdrawing funds. With cash in both our pockets we head to Ye Olde Watering Hole for its cheap prices and the fact that I remember a few different good types of beer being on tap the last time we went there. 73 On our way to get Allison food at Fitzwilly’s we walk by a mannequin at the entrance to a little clothing place. “You should wear a dress like this one. It would look good on you,” she says to me. “I disagree,” I say. “No, but see? The fit would work. The material would stretch here at the hips, so it would look like this…” She tries to demonstrate by pulling at the dress, but this makes the top of the dress fall off from both shoulders, revealing the curves of two mannequin breasts. I laugh the sort of laugh I most commonly laugh, which is silent but which still causes me to smile widely, flex my neck, and cover my mouth unnecessarily. The store clerk opens the door and asks if we would like to come inside. We thank her and say no. “And I promise we weren’t trying to do anything scary out here,” I add before we walk on. “Anyway,” I say to Allison, then, “I look much better in a long skirt than in a dress. ” “I can imagine that. You should totally start wearing skirts. We need to just start doing the things we want to do, to normalize them!” I appreciate her attitude about that stuff. Still, as I am pretty sure Allison understands, wearing a skirt or dress when I was in my twenties never made me feel any more or any less myself. Singing on stage or mingling with friends at a nightclub, I could feel that my personality was bigger than what the clothing on me was supposed to represent… and that was kind of the point. A skirt was something inexpensive that I pulled out of the closet once in a while when I knew I could get away with it—the same as when I pulled out blue jeans instead. I wanted to wear the clothing, not what it represented. And once in a while, in the right context, I could. 74 “Do you ever wonder how many bored agents from agencies like the CIA or NSA end up scrolling through page after page of your records and information because of whatever stupid things you’ve chosen to post about online?” I ask. “Yes,” says Allison. “Me too. ” She thinks silently for a few seconds, then says, “It’s amazing, the things people will do because it’s part of their job. I think that’s been true for a long time. And I know it’s going to be true for a long time. ” She sighs, then continues: “Because people are scared. They think if they just do what they’re told they’ll be fine, they’ll keep working, they’ll retire. Just like so many people think that if they write in code, no one’s going to know what they’re really writing about. ” I don’t say anything. “Yeah,” she says. “Exactly. ” 75 “You’re probably the one other person I know who has moved around like I have,” I say to Allison. “Yeah,” she says, “When you get used to moving you just always come around to that thought of where else there is to go. It stops seeming so hard. ” We go to Packards and play darts. Then she’s off to hit the Deuce with some people. I don’t know who they are and she hasn’t asked if I want to go and it’s none of my business. I head back home, where Rosalyn and Emilie are watching Castle on a laptop. I get no enjoyment from shows of that genre, so I just say hi and then lock myself away to write. 76 I’m walking along the bike paths that lead through and between the various small towns. On this particular Saturday, the last day of May, the dampness and the scattered brief showers seem to be keeping people inside. On a warmer and more clear weekend there would be many more walkers, joggers, cyclists, dog walkers and stroller-pushers moving in one direction or the other along the black pavement. But at least the mosquitoes are enjoying themselves. I’m constantly shooing them off me as I go on this, another of the regular long walks that I’ve been trying to fit into as many of my days as possible. I’m composing myself a text message full of prompts for things to write about in the Life Story when I see a little black bear splash into the stream that runs next to the path. Oh! Hey, bear. I think I’ll just avoid you and keep walking. And keep walking I do. Walk, walk, walk, with ear buds extending from my pockets to my ears. My second week in my new clinical placement was short because of the Memorial Day holiday, but I’ve had a lot of positive experiences there so far. I guess it’s not really surprising that I should find it a pleasure to be working with patients who have dementia. I know in the past I’ve had a great time working with people in mental health settings. I’ve also enjoyed working with group home residents who had intellectual impairments. These have all supposedly been populations that it takes a lot of patience to handle properly… but perhaps because I’m a bit of an outsider myself, it’s the outsiders I always seem to be able to understand most easily. The frustrations of a patient who doesn’t comprehend the world in the same way their caretakers do are easier for me to sympathize with than the frustrations of a 9-to-5-working Average Joe or Jane, mainly because the frustrations of those higher-functioning people are too often viewed through sexist, greedy, or xenophobic folk wisdom that I’m expected to agree with. Someone who doesn’t know where they are or who has an exceptionally low IQ can often be helped with just a smile and some assurance that I’m listening to them, whereas that Average Joe or Jane is likely to be distraught if they learn that I don’t care for sporting events or if I don’t enthusiastically agree that our country’s biggest problem is children not being hit by their parents, or whatever. And the therapists I’m working with there have fun, are good to the patients, and have been good to me. Walk, walk, walk. It’s amazing how I can walk for two hours and still have that sense of needing to walk a little farther to think through something (oh what is that something that I wanted to think about I know it was important) as though I am expecting to immediately put to rest some question about who I am or who I am going to be in life. (Can that even be a question? In a way, it feels to me that knowing who I am is sort of easy. Don’t I know myself quite well already? But knowing where to place myself culturally and geographically is admittedly a challenge. ) Walk, walk, walk. Ten weeks to go, and then I can register for the license exam to enter this profession. And then I can resist the urge to take out a billboard saying “fuck you” and listing in big block letters the names of all the awful teachers and other gatekeepers I have met in my life who under slightly different circumstances might have destroyed me with their arrogance about what they thought I (who never had anyone to guide him, recommend him, or advocate for him) could and could not be. This is only the beginning for me. At one point I was an unemployable runaway ninth grade dropout who ate once per day and slept on the couches and floors of meth addicts’ apartments thousands of miles from where anyone in his family lived. When you go from there to earning multiple degrees, having easy middle-class earning potential, and being fluent in the speech and manner of the elites, you arrive not only with a certain amount of momentum but with a certain amount of fear as well. You’ve turned a tale of problems that no one wants to believe exist into a tale of successes that no one wants to believe exist. At that point you know that your existence will always be a little bit lonely, no matter the quality of people you keep around you… but you can at least customize your existence using what you’ve learned about getting by. I walk, walk, walk. Thinking about how quintessentially American I am, even as I increasingly feel that I blame and cannot forgive America for crafting the very terrors it equipped me to survive. I walk, walk, walk. And I have much farther still to walk. "

    "body": "77 I walk with Lily, the OT I ordinarily work with from Tuesday to Friday, to our first treatment session of the day. The patient is someone she doesn’t yet know, but whom I met the previous day. “She’s sweet, but anxious,” I explain about the patient. “She walks up and down her unit all the time, and she likes to get to more quiet parts of the building when she can. ” Cut to thirty minutes later, when that patient has pretended to lose muscle strength, has lowered herself down to a position lying on the floor, and is refusing to cooperate with the people trying to help her back into the chair. “I can’t do it!” she insists, even as she clearly demonstrates the coordination and muscle strength to do it. The other patient in the rehab room is seated in her wheelchair, reacting to internal stimuli, repeating phrases that sound connected to some past trauma. Someone checks the calendar on the wall, saying, “It must be a full moon. ” “This is my third week here,” I say, “And it seems like every day, someone insists it must be a full moon. And it has never been a full moon yet. ” 78 On Tuesday, as I am walking out of Wingate a bit earlier than the usual 3:30 or 4:00 end of my fieldwork, I see that Rosalyn just called, about a minute prior. The weather feels on the hot side to me. I am especially made to sweat once I plop myself down into my Jetta (which I’ve left with the windows up as I usually do, out of habit, because I never want to have to be the person who has to run outside to roll their windows back up if a summer storm comes by). But I turn the car’s air conditioning up to full blast, and while the interior cools I send Rosalyn a text message saying that I just got out. She texts me back while I am driving. I pull off to the side of a residential road, read and reply affirmatively to her invitation to join her at the Five Guys in Enfield, re-set my GPS to the address she had provided, park at this new-to-me location of what I continue to think is a bizarre phenomenon of a high-end, limited-menu greasy hamburger chain, and tap her on the shoulder. It isn’t really time for my dinner yet, so I just help her finish her remaining french fries there in the black-and-white checkered space. Next we walk next door to Asnuntuck Community College, where tonight she will be starting the first day of her chemistry class. She is taking this class in an attempt to gain acceptance to a combination Master’s of Occupational Therapy and Doctorate of Physical Therapy program; it is one of several prerequisites she needs to take within the next couple of semesters in order to be considered for acceptance. I’ve been to this community college once before, years back, to see my friend Alyson in a production of Lysistrata. But I haven’t been back since. Walking through the halls, everything looks and feels to me like it’s 1999. Not just because that was when I was spending a large part of my time in the halls of a community college, but because I get the sense that if I had gone to this community college in the late ’90s and early aughts instead of the two other ones I went to it would have looked, smelled, and felt pretty much the same as it does today, fifteen years later. Stores look different now from how they did back then. So too do most universities, who compete for students in a different sort of way and can always dig up the funds to pay for prettying up the place, mounting flat screen monitors, and sticking up giant printed posters around their campuses. But community colleges, a creation of twentieth century idealism—anyone should be able to meet their potential by taking college courses free or at low cost within their local community!—look more utilitarian, and they also seem to me in the Internet age as something less like a social good and more like an unnecessary barrier to career access. When poor people enter the more well-off people’s universities, the more well-off people create standardized tests with expensive prep courses, or they create a culture of unpaid internships as the first step to a career, or they develop more advanced degree programs requiring more years of tuition and living expenses… because everyone wants their kid to do better than everyone else’s kid. Kids with knowledgeable and proactive parents who live in the right school districts get diagnoses and special accommodations for their disabilities, while students on the other side at best are treated like prisoners and at worst actually become prisoners. The result is millions of people learning and teaching curricula they don’t believe in… and a culture that increasingly mocks intellectual pursuit as impractical, since it gets in the way of the rat race children are now born into more than ever. Aren’t community colleges kind of just a hoop to jump through for a class of people unaccustomed to the circus? 79 An old man who is to be discontinued from therapy today. He is reluctant to come with Lily and me to the rehab gym. “I think that smell is him,” Lily says. “I think so, too,” I say. We are standing in one of the common areas, a room where several other residents all sit facing the television. The smell of feces could only be due to several people who are sitting in there, so I casually walk the circumference of the room and sniff as I go. “I took an olfactory stroll and I’d say it’s him, yes. ” We convince him to go back to his room and to enter his bathroom, but he resists getting on the toilet for Lily. “Would you rather he help you?” she asks him, pointing to me, since sometimes people are more likely to accept help from one or the other gender when it comes to self-care tasks such as toileting. “Yes,” he says, but when I unbutton his belt he stops me and buttons it again. In a nursing home setting, occupational therapists often save the nursing assistants work by doing toilet transfer training when a resident needs to be changed, or by turning a resident’s grooming into an informal assessment of daily living skills, that sort of thing. But if a patient’s resisting, there’s no real therapeutic opportunity to be found. So, we lead this particular resident back to the common room and tell someone that he smells like he needs to be changed but that he is in an uncooperative mood. His need begins to look more urgent when we notice the diarrhea dripping down his pant leg and onto his shoe. Wait. Why was I telling this story? 80 I don’t like the overhead sunlight, all overbearing and confident, burning, forcing you to get more naked. What I like is the last light of day and how its purples and blues change from minute to minute. A radio journalist in another country says through the Internet, then over electromagnetic waves, then into my phone and into my ears that poetry seems to come into a boy’s life at just the wrong time—around the age of fifteen, when you just care about baseball and girls. Poetry, says the radio journalist, is something that one associates with the kids just trying to impress the teacher, to be what the authority figures around them would prefer them to be. The opposite seemed true for me when I was fifteen. I scoffed at all the sports-talking, dirty-magazine-reading boys who won the approval of the teachers. I and the other rebels skipped out of pep rallies to talk literature, which we assumed was a phenomenon belonging only to the past (since we had encountered no contemporary examples) but which we could imagine bringing back in the context of some new and thrilling anti-anti-intellectual revolution. The network of bike paths running through the Pioneer Valley was built within the past ten years, part of a trend in various states to pave along clearings once made for train tracks. Train tracks stretching into every little town and village were a twentieth century thing; casual bike riding among adults is a twenty-first century thing. On this day I walk to where a stretch of the bike path ends abruptly. To continue I need to step over the old tracks. Some of them have been torn up. A pile of wood planks obstruct some of the clearing over which passenger trains once moved. To scramble down the little incline of rocks and soil on my way to the next intersecting road reminds me of my elementary school years. In my childhood (and even in my adolescence) it felt normal to slip down muddy hills through brown and yellow New England forest, to walk on rotted scrap wood over tiny streams, through woods owned by it-didn’t-matter-who, and then to emerge behind a strip mall, to walk to the video rental store, and to rent some new video game for a couple of bucks per night… …in a community that moved just a bit more slowly than others, a community still huddled inside, recreating lifestyles borne out of scarcity in Russia and Poland and Ireland. The twilight is unusable. It is impractical, except as a warning. Your baseball games and your girl-chasing have to be put on pause. You’re left, then, with only two options: to sleep or to artificially extend your day with the electric light. The electric light is your only chance for poetry. 81 During my Friday night walk, as I pass through the center of Northampton, I run into Jonny. He is with his girlfriend, although she is at first on the phone with somebody and then on the way to a particular store for something. “Do you want to go walk with Levi and then find me there when you’re done?” she suggests to him, and he says yeah, sure. I feel awkward at first in talking to my old friend. (“When did we meet, 1999?” I ask him. “2000,” he says, and even names the month, a detail I then quickly forget again. ) I feel awkward in my posture and in my eye contact, just as I have been feeling awkward around most people since, like, around the start of 2012. I would probably fear that I was permanently losing my ability to be socially pleasant, if I hadn’t been through times like this before and then recovered. He talks about the music projects he might be getting into and the cities he has been thinking about trying to move to. He is still working as an audio tech for speeches given in conference halls, or something like that. He goes to meet with his girlfriend, and I walk on to where I had already been headed. I don’t really bother to reflect on our friendship again much, since it has mostly been gone for so many years now. 82 “I wouldn’t want that,” whispers one of the therapists. She means that she wouldn’t want to survive so long with a progressive disease that would leave her confused at all times about where she was and what was happening. She wouldn’t want to be dependent for feeding. She wouldn’t want strangers to be dressing her every morning while she failed to understand what was happening. I feel differently. When I was a teenager, I made the choice to continue living a life that all experience told me would not be worth living. And I’m glad I made that irrational choice. Although it’s true that the people I assist with their feeding and washing cry and fear and lash out for no reason, so too does every seventeen-year-old I have ever met. I would love to survive long enough to die old, even gradually, even after years of low-level functioning. 83 I’m not a morning person at all. Neither is the person I share a bed with, Rosalyn, who tends to go to sleep at around 12 to 1 in the morning. But I need to wake up at somewhere between 5 and 6 during the week, so after usually going to bed at the same time she does and then getting up and spending the day in the nursing home I’ve been napping in the afternoons a lot. On this particular Friday, after a short day at my fieldwork site, I take a longer than usual nap. This puts me in the position of waking up and feeling ready to start a second half of my day at around 8:30 in the evening. Conveniently, though, as I sip on a coffee and sit in front of my laptop checking Facebook, I get a chat message from Harry inviting me to go out somewhere for a drink. After fixing my hair (still messed up from my nap) and putting on my sneakers and an unbuttoned collared shirt over my tee shirt, I drive to Northampton and find a parking spot near Hugo’s. I cross the street. Somehow, then, for some reason, my car’s panic alarm goes off. I guess I’ve accidentally hit the “lock” button on my key too many times? I had no idea I was doing such a thing. As I wait to walk back across the street to try to stop my car horn from honking and my lights from flashing again and again and again, I hear people calling, “Levi!” in recognition of me… but I don’t bother to respond, too busy being embarrassed by the obnoxious noise of the alarm and trying to figure out how to make it stop. I get in my car, turn on and then turn off the ignition. There probably is some better way to get the alarm to stop, but I don’t know what it is. Back across the street, I see that it was Allison calling my name. “Sorry,” I say. “I had a… distraction to deal with, which you may have noticed. ” “Oh, really? No, I didn’t notice. What was it?” she jests. “If I could pay extra to get a car key without that panic feature, I would definitely do it,” I say, smiling and nodding to the guy standing next to her. They are standing outside of Ye Olde Watering Hole. “I’m meeting Harry at Hugo’s,” I say. Seeing that she doesn’t recognize the name, I say, “You met him one night. ” She introduces me to the guy she is standing with. I shake hands and immediately forget his name. In that moment, I start to think about what I will do to exit this interaction appropriately. Instead of running the risk of overstaying my welcome I give the guy a quick nice-to-meet-you, then extend my hand to Allison for a handshake as well and say, “Nice running into you,” indicating that I am now moving on. I have always found Allison’s nonverbal communication tricky to read—I think she probably has some subtle and specific anxieties (as I do) which can make her appear standoffish even moments after being inviting and friendly. In any case, as I reach out for a handshake she seems to tense up? Sometimes I imagine that I see Allison the way certain people see me: easy to like, but hard to read. Easy to imagine could stay on your side forever, but also easy to imagine could vanish forever. It’s fascinating to me that we met each other in Philadelphia and are now running into each other in this little college town that is such a big part of my past. I walk to Hugo’s and find Harry at a table with a couple he knows. I estimate them to be about his age, which is five-ish years younger than I am. I order a beer, bring it to the table, sit down, don’t really do a good job of fitting into the already-in-progress group conversation, and end up just chatting one-on-one with Harry from then on. I talk about my OT stuff, while Harry talks about his work as an assistant teacher. Charlie and a friend of his pass by, sharply dressed, out being social on a Friday night. Thirteen and a half years ago was when I befriended Charlie, right when I began to use LiveJournal for the first time. That friendship between the two of us, plus my effective use of the Internet to meet and chat and make assorted plans with my peers in the pre-Facebook, pre-cell phone era, dramatically increased the number of interesting-to-me people I knew in the area. Northampton, Massachusetts became a character to me, then. It became a personality who could actively help, hinder, like, or loathe me. And on the whole, it was usually fairly kind to me. But I also had another, larger, less tolerant municipality in my life—Chicopee, my hometown, about ten miles south. And escaping both the geography and the spectre of that place was a priority for me. A farewell gathering for me happened in this very bar in the early part of 2007, and that is when I feel like I really left for good. I’ve come back a couple times, but I never really let myself return. Charlie probably sees me, but he doesn’t talk to me. I could try waving and saying hello—he would almost certainly come over and be cool, and maybe even interested in what I’ve been up to—but I don’t. Harry and I move on to McLadden’s, then, which it’s my first time going to. Sitting at the bar there, I get a second beer while he, getting tired, only gets a water. Harry and I have never been close, but we have on various nights hung out, usually at karaoke nights, together. I ask him, “So, Harry, do you ever date anyone?” He tells me he’s bad at dates, so nothing much usually comes of them. He mentions that he had a brief romance during a theatre production he was involved in recently; I assume that he is talking about the actress from the local production of Jesus Christ Superstar I met that one time at the World War II Club, whom I had immediately liked and would have been delighted to start having around if the two of them had become a real item. He says, “This isn’t the best area for dating for heterosexual males,” and I do not voice my opinion, which happens to be that in fact, given the disproportionate number of educated young women relative to their male counterparts in a low-population-density area that includes two of the most well-regarded women’s colleges in the country, Northampton gives anyone looking to date young women an unusually high quality dating pool, at least up to a certain age. “Everyone has things they’re good at and things they struggle with,” he says. “One of the things I struggle with,” I say, “Is trying to keep from isolating myself. ” Trying to relate with this, he says that a lot of times he finds himself tempted to stay inside the house and to become less social. “Well, ‘isolating myself’ is probably the wrong way to put it,” I say. “It’s like… you’ve called me a ‘whimsical eccentric’ before. But there’s a fine line between the eccentric who does things a little differently, brings unexpected things to a conversation, whatever, and the weird guy that no one can really relate to, the guy you see on the streets sometimes going through his bizarre routines in his own little world. I think because of being an only child and sort of raising myself and finding my own way on an unusual path, I have to make a point of not just getting by but also being the sort of person others can still relate to. ” "

    "body": "84 Meeting with Salma after fieldwork on Monday. Our arranged meeting place is at Holyoke Community College, where she’s attending some sort of conference. As I wait for her I get to walk around this space and remember how differently I saw it way back in January of 1998, when I (then a sixteen-year-old high school dropout) took my first classes there. I thought then that that plain concrete campus in a city most people have never heard of was just what college was like. I was too new to the world to imagine that it could more appropriately be thought of as a bridge to higher education than a real college/university experience in itself. Walking around the C building (or the “Fine and Performing Arts Building”, as signage now describes it) for the first time in many years, I realize that the old green room, which served as a daily hangout for all of us who were then associated with the Drama Club, is now gone to make room for a skyway to a building since added to the campus. Framed photographs from productions put up over the years line the walls of the hallway. I feel certain that the production of Hamlet in which I played Horatio will be here somewhere. It was a pivotal moment in not just my life, but in the lives of numerous others I knew who were involved with it at the time. It was visually striking. And the cast! Ophelia became a successful television actress. Hamlet moved to Chicago to do plays there. I… well, I didn’t go on to become an actor, but I at least remember looking good in the photos! But nowhere on the walls is the Hamlet production from the year 2000 acknowledged. In fact, none of the plays that went up while I was a student made it onto the walls. Oh, well. Salma and I improvise our time together on this particular night. I take her to the mall so that we can rest but she can have access to benches if and when her back gives her pain. Then we eat at that homey Mexican and Salvadoran restaurant in South Hadley. Then we go the Thirsty Mind for coffee, and to the bar and grill downstairs from there for a cocktail (for her) and a glass of wine (for me). All along we talk about our lives and ambitions and all that. The night is so relaxed as to feel kind of idyllic. Then I go to bed and wake up in the morning feeling all gross and sick-feeling again, but whatever. 85 I’ve been under the weather through the weekend and into the first half of the week. I’m working with two different OTs during this twelve-week affiliation: Vicky, the manager of rehab (Mondays and for the first hour or so of the day on most other days) and Lily, the other, newer-to-the-site OT (with whom I work for most of the day from Tuesday through Friday). Lily talks to me more than Vicky and says that she thinks I’m doing well in this placement, but it has started to seem to me that Vicky is a little annoyed by my more quiet and reserved nature, or something. It’s probably not a big deal, but I have to think about these things. (I wonder if I’ll always feel like an interloper in the health care world. I probably will. ) But today, Vicky was out. With the boss away, the longer-than-usual day ended up feeling more positive and flowing more smoothly than usual. At one point in the afternoon we ended up with Frank Sinatra songs playing in the rehab gym, with Lily dancing with one patient (who has been showing serious improvements in her responsiveness and ability to participate in her care and would not have been able to do such a thing last week) while another patient, waiting for the physical therapist to come back and wonderfully inspired by the sight of this dancing, began trying uncharacteristically (but sadly unadvisedly) to push herself out of her wheelchair to join in the dancing until I sat and held her hand and chatted with her about the music and she enthused about how wonderful we all were. 86 On June 20, 2014, most of my Bay Path College classmates finish their final fieldwork placements. I still have seven weeks to go. 87 “All right, good. The notes you wrote for that treatment were perfect. ” Lily repeats, with exaggerated excitement: “Perfect!” “Do you want to write some of mine for me?” jokes Ada. “I hate writing all the therapy notes. You can make some extra money that way. ” “No, he’s going to write a novel and become famous. ” “You know what?” says Ada. “That wouldn’t surprise me. I have a feeling, you know, that we’ll find something like that actually happens. ” Later in the day, Ada volunteers that if I’m ever looking for one she’ll write me a recommendation letter: “I know you’re doing occupational therapy and I’m a physical therapist, but still, if you need it. ” Vicky, sitting in the room for this, remains silent and makes no similar offer. But that’s fine. I expect these things. 88 Today, after I’ve endured being in the same room for two different conversations between white staff about the “laziness” of non-whites in the area, I find myself chatting with a patient (also white) while she receives e-stim to facilitate muscle strengthening. I ask her if she lived in the same city all her life before coming to this nursing home, and she says yes. This turns into her saying, “It was a really nice place before all the Puerto Ricans moved in. ” I try to politely introduce an alternative to the narrative she has suggested. “Well,” I say, “I bet the city will get nicer before long. That’s just how it goes, I think. Places get better, then worse, then better, then worse. Every generation is a new opportunity. ” I like this assertion I’ve made, but behind me, the other therapists start laughing. “This generation scares me,” one comments to the other. I turn around to talk to them. “That’s what every generation says. Our parents said that about us. ” They say no more—not because I’ve won, but because I’m asking them to question their assumptions and they have no reason to oblige me. 89 I stop at home, then drive toward Northampton to walk. On the highway I find myself behind a car that has come to a complete stop in the midst of moving traffic. Driving past this car, I see that the driver appears to be unconscious. I turn on my hazard lights, park along the shoulder, and dial 911. “That has already been reported and state police are on their way,” I’m told by the emergency services operator. But I’m the first car to have pulled over next to it. Another car finally pulls over, too. This driver is smarter than I am. Whereas I have just been sitting in the driver’s seat, watching the incapacitated driver in my rear view mirror, awaiting a police cruiser, failing to think of the appropriate helpful thing to do, this other driver gets out to direct the oncoming traffic into adjacent lanes. I assist in this, then, until a police officer comes along, parks his cruiser with the lights flashing, and walks over to the passed out driver. I see him remove an open beer can from the vehicle. “Were you involved?” he asks. I say that I wasn’t. He tells me that I can go. So I do. 90 July 2, 2014. The mid-point of this fieldwork passes, but it’s not until five days later that I get to see the numbers rating my performance thus far. They’re fine. No problems there. As I walk back to the car on another boringly hot, boringly humid, sometimes cloudy, sometimes sunny, Massachusetts summer day-with-a-chance-of-thunderstorms, I’m thinking to myself about how sort of indifferent I feel, nowadays, when it comes to other people’s assessments of my competence. Why waste time struggling to convince others that I seem like the sort of person who might be able to do things? Why should I wait, and wait, and wait some more for the validation of hearing other people saying that they believe I can do things, when doing the things themselves without permission is not actually that hard? Sometimes, living a life without brokers for your self-esteem is just more efficient. 91 When I first met her about two and a half years ago Rosalyn was trying to decide what she was going to do next, career-wise. She knew that she wanted to make more money. She also feared that the day would come, sooner than later, when (because of the increasing impact of her chronic pain and its effects on her body) she wouldn’t be able to handle the day-to-day physical requirements of any job she could find with her current credentials as a physical therapist assistant. At some point after meeting me she decided she wanted to go back to school to become an occupational therapist. She was originally going to apply along a timeline that would have her matriculating in 2013, but the deadlines sort of came and went before going back to school could become her priority. Because it’s something I’m especially good at doing, I helped her find schools and all the relevant information about their admission standards, program length, tuition costs, and so on. She applied to several programs to potentially matriculate in the fall of 2014, but she didn’t get in anywhere. She started taking classes to better qualify herself as an applicant. As I helped her find which classes she would likely need to take to effectively target different schools, she grew attached to the idea of going through a dual Doctorate in Physical Therapy/Master’s in Occupational Therapy program (the only such program in the country). Admission to that would require a lot—including courses in Chemistry and Physics, which would be a serious challenge for her to do well in because of her math learning disability and the anxiety anything relating to numbers tends to cause her. She found a chemistry class taking place in the evenings this summer. She worked both with a tutor at the school and with a private tutor, but before much of the semester had passed it was clear she no longer had any way of getting the grade she needed. Earlier this week she asked me to help her take a fresh look at the requirements of different OT schools, given that applying to the dual program is no longer seeming realistic. I started by looking at new programs. One of the first I found is surprisingly still accepting applications for a cohort beginning in September, and Rosalyn seems to have all the qualifications they are asking for. The location is Orange County, California—which, meh—but Rosalyn is looking for just any place that she could tolerate for a couple of years. Since then she has been communicating with people at the program via phone and email, and she is getting her transcripts sent by expedited post. She says the people have been very encouraging and that if they don’t see any dealbreakers in the application materials she might be flying to California within the next couple of weeks to interview. It would be a major and sudden change of plans for her, but I’m rooting for it to happen. 92 July 4. I thought Lily and I were only supposed to be seeing four patients on this particular day, but that turns into five treatments plus a new patient evaluation. Demonstrating biceps curls using hand-held weights. Applying the pads and connecting the wires of an e-stim machine to stimulate muscle contractions for strengthening and to facilitate better functional use of those muscles. Describing strategies for gathering food from a plate with a utensil in spite of visual deficits. Trying with a respectable amount of success to come across to the family of residents as fun, competent, caring, and helpful all at the same time. Having a resident kick a ball, use an arm bike, practice safer ways of standing up from a wheelchair. Then I’m back home. Rosalyn is still at work. I don’t expect to take a nap, but when I lie down with Kaylee (on the mattress which I bought and had delivered to my apartment at 206 S. 13th St, Apt 1606, Philadelphia, PA back in the year 2011, a mattress that hasn’t been the same since it was folded in half to fit into the hitch that Bruce and my uncle Bill brought when I returned to Chicopee a little under a year later) I do fall asleep, and it’s all I can do to get my muscles to roll me over and off the bed a few hours later once I’ve returned to consciousness. Rosalyn is hurting physically, looking forward to an appointment with her chiropractor tomorrow morning. 93 Beginning in September, I’ll have a lot to read. I’ll be busy in my spare time taking two (night) classes per semester as I gradually finish the Masters in Writing I started pursuing in 2008. I think I might try writing a sort of weekly reflection that links what I’ve been doing in a given week to whatever book I’ve just finished reading. It feels like that might be a way to keep this written narrative of my life going without losing focus on what I’ll need to do in that program. If that works, the more wacky part of this idea is that I could make an audio podcast of these weekly reflections read aloud. 94 New ideas are where my mind is at, after all. 95 And I’ve started applying to jobs in Northern Virginia. 96 And I’m registered for my Fall courses at Johns Hopkins. One is a workshop taking place on Thursday nights in Baltimore; the other meets in person three times in Baltimore and three times in D. C. , with the eight remaining weeks of the course being entirely online. 97 Rosalyn is binge-watching the second half of the fourth season of The Walking Dead, which she just learned aired during the early months of 2014. “Hey, sorry to interrupt your zombie apocalypse,” I say. I sit down on the mattress in her room, which she has been spending a lot of time not moving from in recent weeks. “I’m curious, though. How is your application coming?” “I just need to send out the requests for transcripts to my school,” she says. “There’ll be a faxing spree that happens tomorrow as soon as I get to work. ” “Awesome. And then you just have to wait for the transcripts to be sent out, and once the school gets them they’ll either tell you there’s a problem or they’ll tell you to come to California for an interview, right?” “Pretty much. ” “And are you excited? I’m excited for you. ” She looks away in thought for a second. “I was excited when I saw that there was the possibility. But right now I’m just waiting. I can’t afford to be excited. ” It’s my turn to pause. “Because you’ll feel too let down if you don’t get accepted?” “Sort of. ” This leads into her talking about how she’ll quickly need to figure out what to do with Kaylee if she gets accepted. Finding housing will be hard enough, she says, and the rent will already be so expensive in Irvine even with her not trying to find a pet-friendly apartment, without trying to transport the dog across the country to live in it with her. At some point she rests her head on my knee and I see water on her face. “Are you crying?” I ask. “I am. ” “I didn’t see that coming,” I say. “What’s going on?” She says that she’s worried about the dog. “I really think we’ll figure it out,” I tell her. “And you know me; I don’t say that unless I really mean it. ” After we’ve talked a little more and moved ourselves out into the kitchen, she says, “You know, sometimes I think that the reason Kaylee came into my life is so I’d have a reason not to kill myself. Because every time things got bad, I’d think, ‘No, I took on this responsibility when I adopted a dog, and I have to make sure she’s cared for. ’” I fall quiet. “What are you thinking about?” she asks me. “Wouldn’t you like to know,” I say. “Yes. I would,” she says. “You fell quiet. ” “Yes. I did,” I say. And she hugs me. I used to think I was pretty clever for seeing that she was depressed underneath it all. 98 Lily asks me a question: “If you won the lottery, would you still do what you’re doing? Or would you drop everything and just, like, travel, relax on the beach, live a life of leisure?” “I think I would still be working toward the same things I’m working toward now,” I say. “Except I wouldn’t have to worry so much about having enough money at every step of the way. ” 99 I find myself upset and unable to concentrate on my eval-writing as I hear another workplace-inappropriate, racist conversation among the therapists, all of whom vocally agree that the local Puerto Rican population is lazy, taking advantage of government benefits, and stealing money from all of their paychecks. On my lunch break, after driving alone across the street to the nearby Chinese food restaurant, I sit in my car for a few minutes to put into the words the following sentiment. I post it privately to my Facebook so that no one else sees it but I won’t lose it: “Bonding with other spoon-fed middle-class types over how ‘lazy’ the local poor people are is, ironically, the laziest thing in the world. ” The more privileged the people I find myself around, the more I find myself interfacing with ideas that I kind of thought belonged only to really old-timey cultural conservatives. I suppose it makes sense: the people who earn enough money to buy houses and vacation to Disney World have often inherited their careers from their parents or from their parents’ social networks. And to some of these people, walking the path to a comfortable life just means parroting whatever the people you grew up with have always believed. 100 Walking around Northampton tonight, I think to myself that the critical mass has finally been reached. I feel convinced that a majority of the people I see walking around the town center on this warm summer night would have been afraid to be associated with the place fifteen years ago—afraid to find any appeal in a town where women held hands with each other in public, where men wore their hair long, where teenagers sat on the sidewalk drawing comic books, where restaurants existed that served no meat at all. It was a place for the normal people to mock. Like Northampton, I don’t look the way I did in the year 2000. Not only does my style change, but my character changes, too. I don’t take it too seriously. My character is like a web domain I’ve chosen, or a user handle. It’s a defensive thing. Character is a finite set of traits selected to interact with others in the context of a narrative that has countless authors. It’s easy to grow attached to traits that have been rewarded in the past, but if you absolutely refuse to swap some of them out once in a while, you will literally lose the plot. 101 I’m seeing an article going around Facebook about the “nationwide gentrification effect” pricing certain classes not just out of neighborhoods but out of entire cities. The article even mentions that this is not just in outlier cities like San Francisco and New York, but in cities across the nation. The lower-earning segments of the population end up increasingly unable to afford living in proximity to the amenities that cater to the higher-earning ones. Well, of course. This is the America that is being chosen now. If you don’t learn to play, you get pushed off the playing field. You can’t afford Manhattan, so you move to Brooklyn. You can’t afford Brooklyn, so you move to the Bronx. You can’t afford the Bronx, so you go to prison. You’re not making the prison money, so you die. We refuse to have a public conversation about how to plan our economy, how to organize our society, and so we let the forces that cause disparity run wild, exacerbating the problem at incredible speed. Politics become an ongoing argument over whose ideas are scarier, but what’s truly scary is that no one is behind the wheel. Certain neighborhoods and rural areas have long been places of death. We’re creating more of these areas while also creating more millionaires. Almost any action, any discussion of the problem could stop this from happening, but I don’t think any such discussion will emerge. I think America will just become more and more one of those countries a person moves away from instead of toward. "

    "body": "102 Claire comes up to visit Rosalyn. They drive around to some various places while I stay inside and apply to fifteen advertised positions for occupational therapists in Northern Virginia. 103 Rosalyn steps out of the ladies’ room on the basement level of the Holyoke Mall. I’m waiting for her in the hallway. “You know,” I say to her, motioning to the now sort of barren-looking hallway, “Ten, fifteen years ago, this hallway was lined with pay phone after pay phone. And now, look. [I point to the frame of what until recently was the one remaining pay phone. ] Now there are none. There used to be telephones everywhere. Think of how short a span of time that is. And for the most part we don’t even think about it now, do we? Things were changing, then they had changed, and now, already, they just are. ” 104 I spend most of the work week not quite finding time to respond to the phone messages job recruiters are leaving me since I sent out my resume to a bunch of places. By Thursday I’ve spoken to one person and returned the messages of a few others, usually clarifying that I’m not free to interview during the week until after August 8. I’m not getting responses to these follow-ups, which makes me think that I maybe should have waited a little longer before reaching out to these companies. Oh, well. I am continuing to revise my plans for my life, which I keep typed out in a text file on my laptop computer and stare at pretty much every day. My plans for myself have only involved a handful of different possibilities, really… but as I research those possibilities, certain of them begin to look more or less compatible with each other. So, I keep tweaking the details of what I think I’ll be doing in one year, two year, or five years. 105 I have a phone interview with the director of rehab at a facility in D. C. , but he says he wouldn’t feel comfortable extending an offer to me until after I pass my boards. That could take a while, of course, and they’ll be looking for someone else to take the job, and I’m hoping to find a position with an earlier start date if I can. So, that’s that, probably, although I liked how the job sounded. 106 It’ll be nice to finish what I started at Johns Hopkins six years ago. I received my first acceptance letter in early 2007, when I was moving to Philadelphia in a desperate bid to escape a post-university life of working two night jobs and living in my mother’s basement and taking home $200 a week. At least now it doesn’t feel like every decision I make about my life might be my only chance to escape a miserable status quo. 107 “Did I mention that it’s this coming Monday when I’m going to visit my grandmother and my father?” “No,” says Rosalyn. “Oh! Okay. So, yup. That’s happening. ” “How do you feel about seeing your father again?” “Umm. Not much, I guess. I feel like I pretty much know what to expect from him at this point. ” Our discussion of this topic goes more in depth. At one point in the midst of it she comments, “Your feelings about your family are probably the most detached I’ve ever seen from anyone who hasn’t experienced an actual abuse or neglect situation. ” “Yeah,” I agree. I go on to think aloud about how who I am mostly developed after my father moved to South Carolina. I was about twelve or thirteen years old at the time. Once the figure who had sheltered and controlled me for so many years was geographically distant I could dismiss him as a fanatic entirely. I erased the chalkboard then, so to speak. I put together my values and opinions from scratch. My mother, meanwhile, was not an assertive person. She did not have many strong opinions. Nor was she accustomed to having much control over me, since my father had been so determined to raise me in a family of his own rigid design. I rarely had substantial conversations with her. “What about Bruce?” asks Rosalyn. “He has been good in that fatherly role. ” I’m not sure I’ve heard more than three sentences from Bruce in any given day for the past several years, now, but I think Rosalyn’s idea of a good father figure allows for this. “I’m certainly glad that he has managed to keep me housed all these years,” I say. “He never tried to edge me out of the family, the way that some stepfathers would. ” Of course, a child without siblings often has a special pull on the choices his mother makes. I asserted this when I successfully vetoed Bruce’s proposal of marriage to my mother for a number of years. I doubt Bruce could have ever realistically expected my subsistence to be anything other than my mother’s first priority. And then there’s the rest of the extended family—all my mother’s many sisters and brothers, and all my cousins and now second cousins. But if they ever would have had a place for me—which I’m not sure they would have, given the spectre of my father and how poorly he got along with them all—it has seemed pretty clear to me for several years now that once you run away from a family, all the feelgood sayings they repeat to each other about family coming first stop applying to you. There’s no such thing as family until you’re loyal. There’s no such thing as love until you love. So, I put these together from scratch, too. 108 Rosalyn, from the next room, while I am doing dishes: “I got in. ” I shut off the water, walk into her room or her studio or her study or whatever it is, and I give her a hug. “Congratulations,” I say warmly. She’s moving to California! She’s going to be an OT! 109 I have pre-existing plans with Salma, in which I now decide to include Rosalyn. We drive up route 5 to Northampton, find some parking (which is a little more difficult to do than usual due to a sidewalk sale thing going on) and walk into Thai Garden, where Salma is already waiting for us. Our outing passes sort of quickly after dinner has finished. Salma is in pain—her back is almost always hurting her at least somewhat in the course of an average day, she tells us—and she almost leaves immediately, in fact, after we step out of the restaurant. My frowny face convinces her to stay, but after some walking around the town center she still makes an early exit. “I love you, Rosalyn. I love you, Levi,” she says, giving us both hugs and then groaning slightly as she climbs into her car. It occurs to me that Salma, Rosalyn, and I will each be starting in a different graduate program, in a different part of the country, as of September. I’m very tired at this point, and I know that I want to try to get some sleep tonight (for a change) in order to be as prepared as possibly for tomorrow’s drive to Maryland after fieldwork. “What time will Emilie be getting in?” I ask. Rosalyn specifies a time that is a little more than two hours in the future, and says that the arrival place is the Northampton bus station. “Oh,” I say. “So I guess we’ll be staying in town until then…” We get seated at Fitzwilly’s, where we’re planning to kill those remaining couple of hours… but then my tiredness really starts to hit me. I’ve been sick for—what, two weeks now? And I have had almost no full nights of sleep since coming back to Massachusetts for this last fieldwork. So I ask for us to go home. Rosalyn is annoyed that she’ll have to drive all the way back, which will take twenty to twenty-five minutes each way and also cost her gas money. But we do go back. In the end (as I find out when I wake up at around one in the morning and as usual cannot immediately fall asleep) it turns out that Emilie wasn’t on the bus at all—she had overslept after lying down for a nap. But she and Rosalyn have made plans for Emilie to take a bus in the morning instead. Now I just have to wake up on time, load the car with the end tables Rosalyn has asked me to bring down to Maryland her sister, and finish my planned half day at fieldwork. 110 I stand facing the exact center of the stage, leaning against the railing at the back of the fairly small standing-room-only area in front of all the stadium seating at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. I’ve driven here after leaving my fieldwork at noon and surviving traffic delays and fearing at times that I would arrive too late, but I’m here on time for Neutral Milk Hotel. The band starts to make a certain type of sense when you see them. Unlike when I saw him on the first show of the tour that he did alone, Jeff Mangum is now hiding behind a full beard, mustache and cap, while the Pavilion video screens have been turned off per the band’s request and it has been asserted in many ways that photography and videography are both prohibited. Julian Koster spins around in circles when he is playing bass guitar, and he never really stops. The heights of his vestibular threshold are astonishing. As the titular song from the band’s celebrated album In the Aeroplane over the Sea is being played live onstage in the present tense, on what the band’s web site describes as the last D. C. area show for the foreseeable future, in what feels like a large venue for the sort of band they are, although a weirdly sort of legendary status has been attributed to them over the years, I think to myself: these are artists. And they always were. And I along with many of the people I know are artists, too, but only if you allow that effort and dedication to and sophistication in the practice of a thing should be enough to earn someone of the label of “one who does” that thing (whether or not pay stubs are available upon request). From all I’ve seen, actually, people are internally motivated to develop their natural talents and require external motivators only when they’re not really cut out for a task. I don’t want to plan my life around promises of being paid; I want to help people. And that’s not the same as looking like&lt;/i I’m helping people. I just really want to be in this thing with the rest of the world—to be human, whatever that has ever meant, and whatever that will be seen to mean in the future. And when we meet on a cloud I’ll be laughing out loud I’ll be laughing with everyone I see Can’t believe how strange it is to be anything at all…&lt;/i&gt; 111 The next morning, Rosalyn’s mom is gone somewhere when I wake up. The coffee maker I was using when I was staying here before is no longer out on the kitchen counter, so I head out to the mall for Starbucks, plus some fast food. Coffee cup still in hand, I walk through the humid early afternoon to my car, where I make use of my phone to research ideas for where to go today. I figure I’d like to drive by the place in Fairfax, Virginia where I’ll be interviewing for that OT position in a couple of weeks. On the way there, I think, it could be nice to find a part of D. C. to explore on foot. I decide on Georgetown. The parking garage at Georgetown University usually costs $3 per hour, but it turns out it’s not charging today. (Because it’s the summer? Because it’s Sunday? I see no signs mentioning the fact that parking is free; I just drive in and see that no one is attending the lot and that vehicles are free to drive in and out as they please. ) I put music in my ears and walk towards Dupont Circle. By the time I’ve stopped at Le Pain Quotidien to drink a coffee and a water, to use the restroom, and to sit in a chair at a small table while looking up D. C. -related things on my phone, I’m adrift in my head again, envisioning possibilities for the future, for my new temporary life around here. 112 July 27, 2014. I was considering visiting New York today on my way back to Massachusetts from Maryland. Checking around   online for interesting-looking things led me to discover the New York City Poetry Festival, taking place on Governor’s Island, a free event… but I woke up late there in Rosalyn’s mother’s house in Columbia, and I knew that the weather forecasts were calling for storms all along the east coast, so I decided it would be more prudent to just make a stop in Philadelphia instead. I really liked the idea of taking a walk around the old neighborhood, anyway. I park around Society Hill and go for a little walk with my laptop bag back to 13th and Chestnut, past the Chancellor Apartments building where I lived above the Gayborhood. I walk by that little pizza place to which on bustling summer nights I used to sometimes walk and pick up an order of, say, chicken tenders and french fries, with a side of barbeque sauce, handed to me in a container made of Styrofoam and then wrapped in a plain white paper bag stapled shut. Then to Broad Street just south of City Hall, across from the University of the Arts—a stretch of a few blocks that reminds me even further how conveniently situated a person living here is, not just within the city of Philadelphia but along the Boston-Washington corridor of the east coast of the United States. I don’t trust the American people or government. I will always feel anxious if I find myself limited to living here, with no other options, in an empire lined with invisible trap doors to invisible forms of slavery, where the universities look increasingly like training camps for new generations of low-wage employees who must learn the skills necessary to convince each other with ever-increasing speed and efficacy to hand their earnings up to the wealthy and to prevent it from getting into the hands of the destitute. I have been keeping a fairly close eye on the laws about Canadian permanent residency and citizenship since about the year 2007, when I was living in Washington state and working full-time for that telephone answering service. That was when I was able for the first time in my life to conceive of having the caliber of work experience I would be required to have in order to be welcomed into another country. The process of obtaining permanent residency in Canada as a skilled worker will be changing on the first day of the year 2015, and I will need to find out more about that process to be certain I will still be qualified to apply after a year of full-time employment as an occupational therapist in the U. S. The research I have been doing on the topic has me optimistic, though: I may well be able to get an invitation to become a landed immigrant with a permanent residency card in late 2015 or early 2016. With enough time spent living there I could earn citizenship and live the rest of my life as even more of an unusual and difficult-to-relate-to person. It might be nice to have a little place in this neighborhood of Philadelphia, though, in the future, when I am a world-hopping Canadian. I could treat it as an investment, hire a property management company to take care of it when I have no need to stay in it. But it would always be mine as a place I could return to for a season, for a year, or for retirement, or as a temporary place if someone I knew were in need… I sit at one of the many coffee shops in the neighborhood. I write. It’s nice. The drive back to Massachusetts is long, but when Rosalyn sees me she says I look very happy, very alive—the way I so often look, she says, when I’ve been in an urban environment. The way I came across when she first met me, a little more than two and a half years ago. 113 After fieldwork on Monday I go to Grandma’s house in Paxton. The entire experience only lasts a few hours, much of it spent at the dinner table. After I return to Chicopee, Rosalyn asks me, “How was it? Do you have any reflections?” and I tell her, “It was my first time seeing my father as an old man. ” I asked him about his finances—why he doesn’t have more saved up for retirement and why despite this fact he is so eager to retire early. His only answers are that he lost money when he sold his place in South Carolina to move to Alabama, and that he would really like not to have to work. I also ask him what he does with most of his time. He has never remarried. He has one long-term female friend (who, he finally explains to me on this day, he tried dating for a little while but whose children never liked him) but no real hobbies that I know of aside from reading in the French language. He says that life has been boring at times in some of the places he has lived, but that being a schoolteacher also involved a lot of work. It was probably the most subdued and unoffensive visit with him I’ve had since his separation from my mother when I was twelve. He had me read over parts of his dissertation to suggest corrections. Along with my grandmother (who is now eighty-nine and looking and acting healthier than my father, who is sixty) we discussed tornadoes—one struck Revere, outside Boston, the day prior. I don’t think tornadic activity has actually increased in the area in recent years, but since the storm in 2011 that caused two of them, wrecked a bunch of homes, and killed a few people, Bay Staters have started following these things more closely, expecting each new summer storm to bring with it the next big twister.

    "body": "114 After my second-to-last week as a fieldwork student is done, I meet with Rosalyn at her most beloved American restaurant, Red Robin, in Holyoke. We find ourselves talking about how fascinating it can be to reflect on the ages of some of the patients we work with: “I have patients who remember the Great War,” she says. “Not that they fought in it, but they were children at the time and can remember it going on. ” “Right, that was exactly 100 years ago,” I say. “And by the time World War II finished, those people were old by the standards of their time! Think about it. In your thirties was over the hill. I’ve always been aware that if I live to an old age, I’ll be one of those people about whom the younger folks will say, ‘Wow, that’s so crazy—she was born in the twentieth century!’ Just because of being born in 1981, so close to the year 2000. ” 115 I drive from Amherst to Northampton to meet Allison. We end up at a table at Hugo’s, with her drinking a beer and me drinking a glass of wine. She tells me that she has just started looking into the Nursing program at Greenfield Community College. She says that although she has considered different graduate school programs and things like that in the past few years, nothing ever quite got her motivated to start the process. This feels different, she says, and that’s probably because she knows what she would do after graduating—get into midwifery. “I’m just worried about being able to do it,” she says. “I could make sure to use tutors and whatever, but I’m worried about being able to make it through the program. ” “You can do it,” I say. “No doubt. And what you’re talking about it a lot like what I did with the whole OT thing. ” “Is it?” “Yeah! I had no experience in health care. You have a more relevant work background than I had. You’re nannying. I was answering telephones and working in offices. I had never studied anatomy, or even biology. But you’re smart. I have no doubts that you could make it through. You were someone I always had faith in. I always thought that you would figure it out and find out how to live the way you want to live without losing yourself. I had faith in you, and I really don’t have faith in a lot of people. I don’t say that often. ” “How do we make sure to stay friends?” I ask her. “You’re staying around here for a while, and I’m moving out of the area entirely. I mean, I’ll come back, but it’s hard to do that really often when you’re working a standard sort of forty-hour-a-week job. ” “I don’t know, Levi,” she says. As usual, I can’t tell if she cares or not. “We’ll just have to try not to lose touch. ” She leaves to get picked up by some of her friends and possibly go to the new place, Platinum Pony, that opened up in place of Popcorn Noir in Easthampton. “I should see you again before you leave,” she tells me. “Well, it will have to be next weekend, then,” I say. “Next weekend, then. ” Which surprises me a bit. She is to me a generally surprising person. 116 While discussing with Rosalyn the various advanced degrees I might have an interest in getting, I say, “I wonder how many people are out there who never finished high school but went on to get their doctorate. ” “Not many, I’m sure. ” She looks up from the computer screen. “Like I’ve said, your life story almost reads as a work of fiction. ” “How so?” I ask. “A work of fiction—a made-up tale. Or maybe the seasoned tale of an old codger from the turn of the last century, when people still believed that the American Dream was graspable. When it was thought that you could just pull yourself up by your own bootstraps and all that. ” 117 Alix, Flip, and Harry are right in front of me when I step into the third-floor venue that is Bishop’s Lounge. They are watching the reggae band that is performing for Northampton’s impressively-still-extant community of hippie weirdos. Since communicating is hard over the loud music inside, we go out to the long balcony that serves as a smoking area. It’s actually rather difficult these days for people in Massachusetts who both drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes to find public spots where they may legally do both at the same time. Alix pulls out some weed. It feels like it has been a really long time since I’ve been around someone I knew as they smoked weed. I’m nervous at first, kind of feeling like um what the hell is she doing, until I remember that as part of what seems to be a national trend toward legalization of marijuana use there has been both a complete decriminalization of the possession of the substance in Massachusetts and a system allowing for the legal provision of it to people who have an appropriate medical prescription. My cousin Ken’s ex-boyfriend, Michael, walks up to me and just stands there. I don’t recognize him at first, so I ask where I know him from. I remember when he says his name. Like the last time I ran into him (one or two years ago, I think) he asks about my mother and I don’t have much to say. “Are your mom and Bruce still together?” he asks, seemingly knowing more about their relationship than I do. Most of the remainder of the time our group spends there at the bar (which is actually open until 2:00) has us standing around outside there on the balcony, although we go inside to catch the last ten minutes of the headlining reggae band’s set. As the crowds are being shooed down and I am standing next to Flip and Alix at the bar while they settle their tabs with the bar, Harry comes over and says, about a girl I had not noticed him interacting with, “Her friends just stole her away. I’m going to go and reclaim her from them. ” I turn to Flip and ask, “Is Harry demonstrating the worst of his character traits again?” “No, I think he has actually been pretty good with these things lately,” he says, but I’m unconvinced. Harry comes back a few seconds later. “I decided to let it go. I’ve been drinking,” he says. “Why would you need to chase after her, anyway?” I ask. “Because her fucking friends just came along and snatched her away and didn’t give me a chance to talk tom her. ” “Couldn’t she come back and look for you if she wanted to?” “Yeah, I suppose…” 118 Downstairs and outside, the bunch of us spends the time between 2 and 3 in the morning variously leaning against the brick wall, stepping up and down the curb where the street meets the sidewalk, and in the case of Flip and Alix smoking Marlboro Lights and extinguishing them on the ground. I try with little success to make an amusing story out of my memories of a certain night years ago, probably in 2000 or 2001, when I showed up with my guitar to play the Open Stage at Fire &amp; Water, and I didn’t understand why the night wasn’t starting on time, I didn’t understand why a group of what looked like Smith College students were gathered in a circle around two teenagers playing a full set of poppy folk songs, and I didn’t understand why those two girls were allowed to pre-empt the rest of us when they didn’t even have a band name yet and were going only by their first names, Tegan and Sara. Harry, having missed most of the story in the midst of a conversation with someone else, says, “You’re not badmouthing Tegan and Sara, are you?” “No,” I say, “I like Tegan and Sara. Never mind. ” At some point, Harry begins talking about a children’s book titled If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, in which a mouse who is given a cookie by a child then asks for milk to go with the cookie, then asks for a straw for the milk, and so on. I have never heard of this book. I say, “So… the moral of the story is to never be giving, never be generous to another creature?” A bearded guy from the one of the reggae bands who played earlier interjects. “I’m sorry, but I have to say something about that,” he says, waving a cigarette around and rocking forward and back like a young slam poet. “I spread love everywhere I go,” he says, and begins to tell a story of how all his good karma paid off one time when he was in a new town playing a gig and someone he didn’t know gave him a place to sleep for the night. “So, man, fuck that book about the mouse!” he concludes. “You can go a lot of places by putting off positive energy,” says Alix, nodding. Soon the conversation evolves (without my active participation) into one about religion. “I find that every hardcore atheist I’ve ever spoken to has been a real asshole,” Alix says at one point. I don’t respond to this, and no one asks me whether I am anything other than a hardcore atheist myself. “I’m straight up Catholic now,” she says. Harry is sounding very Agnostic: “I find as I live my life day to day I don’t really have a need for God. ” “You will when you’re older,” says Alix. “That’s a terrible thing to say!” I exclaim, and for once my viewpoint is in the majority. 119 I usually know that Rosalyn and I will not have much to discuss after watching a movie together. After going to see Boyhood at Amherst Cinemas, though, she wants to reflect on what we watched, and this leads to her reflecting on me and my life: “In a way, the boy sort of reminded me of you. It was how quiet he was, I guess. You said that it made you tense to watch some of it. What was that?” I tell her the parts of the movie that included adults yelling at each other in brutally immature ways struck me, because so much of my young life involved being trapped in a situation where I couldn’t escape—where it seemed like I, despite being a young child, was the only person in the house, if not in the entire milieu I was born into, who considered the possible value of managing emotions instead of bullying and name-calling other people whenever possible. “And I remember,” I say, “That while my parents were still together I had a friend whose parents got divorced. I asked him how often his parents fought, and he said that they had something like two fights per day. And I said to him, ‘That’s it? My parents have fights all day. It hardly ever stops for more than an hour. ’ I really think that if I had had siblings, I probably would have been the one picking up the slack and being the adult, being strong and collected for their sake. Because as it was, when I was ten, eleven years I felt like I was the adult of the house, intellectually and emotionally. ” “You absolutely would have played that role to any brothers or sisters,” Rosalyn says. “I feel sure of it. ” “But because it was just me, I never became comfortable with being a leader. Another thing I thought about while watching the movie was that I couldn’t imagine having a mother who was so active in my life—having a mother who mothered. ” Rosalyn repeats a thought she has mentioned to me before: “The only other people I know who talk about family the way you talk about your mother had parents who were out at the bar all the time, or who were truly abusive. ” “Yeah,” I nod, sitting in the passenger’s seat. “My father had been a really, really authoritarian parent, really concerned with my upbringing, and he tried to control her all the time, too. So when he left I guess we just didn’t have a fully-developed mother-son relationship. And she’s depressed all the time. That never changes. So, emotionally, all I really had were the bad aspects of having a father, and no aspects of having a mother. ” “It’s so easy to forget where you come from,” she adds. “You’re so different from the working-class family that you were born into. ” “I think I’ve been really lucky to be able to connect with people who don’t come from that background. Even at fieldwork I see that I’m making an impression with how articulate I come across, or how thoughtful or whatever. And I wouldn’t know what was out there in the world, probably, or I wouldn’t have made it this far if I hadn’t been able to relate to and build connections with people like you, who come from a world where it’s normal to leave the hometown and go to college and whatever. ” “You may actually have more in common with my father than with me. He too came from a culture where everyone just went to high school, found a job within a ten mile radius, got married, and had kids. And his intelligence is what got him to where he is today, but he was very unpopular until he was accomplished. Now there’s a mural of him up at his grade school. ” 120 I apply to more jobs in Northern Virginia. After Monday’s fieldwork I have four days left, and I’m speaking to a recruiter while I’m driving home, then at home I’m leaving messages with a couple of HR managers who have called me back, and I reach one person and schedule the second of what will now be two in-person interviews for OT positions happening a week from Wednesday. 121 I meet up with Alice in Northampton. We eat some Mexican food at La Veracruzana, then get some coffee at Haymarket, then sit on a bench in front of The Deck and the still-under-construction site of the soon-to-be-reborn Northampton train station. This turns out to be a really pleasant time, after so much time has passed without us arranging to hang out. We have a good deal of the sort of deep conversation I famously tend to provoke. 122 The next day, I finish my Master’s degree in Occupational Therapy. I gather together a large group of friends and have a fantastic night out with them. It feels like the best night out ever, actually. Drinks are had around a table at the Patio (which is part of the train station building that also houses the confusingly similarly-named restaurant, the Deck). Rosalyn is there. Alice and her husband Milton are there. It’s my first time meeting Milton, and we end up having good conversation. Salma and Eric are there. Harry is there. Jen is there. We even happen to take a table next to where, along with a friend, my cousin Ken is sitting; he says hello on his way in and goodbye on his way out. After two or three rounds of drinks Jen, Harry and I are up for continuing the night at the World War II Club, while the rest of the group returns to their respective homes at a reasonable hour. Alix and Flip have said that they will meet up with us, and in fact they do. Allison also shows up coincidentally; she and I share a hug and smiles and a few minutes of talk. I texted her earlier in the night from the Patio, but my phone ran of battery shortly after that, and she says that her own phone is out of battery, too. On the way out at the night’s end, I say while passing by Allison, “Pizza time!” “How did you know?” she asks. The meaning of my statement was that I have plans to get pizza at Sam’s with my friends, but she has taken it as a reference to her plans to get pizza with her friends. “Because it’s pizza time for everyone!” I say. And it’s like, Yeah, man. It’s pizza time for everyone. 123 I was never the kid who struggled to learn his lessons at school. A lot of times I already knew the material. So when I was rewarded with compliments and good grades, these didn’t really feel like rewards for following the lessons. Instead, they felt like rewards for the person I was in my spare time—the child who was usually alone, being nerdy, learning things independently. Maybe this is why at the age of thirty-three I can take so much comfort in writing my own curriculum and challenging myself. This is my way of getting things done. This is my way of knowing balance. This is what makes me really happy. "

    "body": "1 The Indirect Review of Books: Introduction. Already this is not going as planned. I wanted to start with To the Lighthouse. About a week and a half ago I took my crumbling old paperback copy of Virginia Woolf’s novel to the eastern panhandle of the state of West Virginia. I took the paperback along with me not only because this meant I was taking Virginia west to West Virginia but because To the Lighthouse is amazing and I like amazing things. Also, I am the sort of person who just sort of does stuff like drive to towns I have never been to before, check on Yelp for where to get a cheap slice of pizza, then read a literary classic at a booth by the window. My plan was to read the Woolf novel over the course of maybe a week or so, then write about my life as it unfolded during the same time frame. This would serve as the first installment for my new project, The Indirect Review of Books. Yes. I would definitely be starting with Woolf, I thought. But I’m at a transitional time in my life. Things have been happening quickly in the couple-few weeks since I moved back to the mid-Atlantic region. Immediately after eating at that pizza place that day, I took a pleasant stroll along a footpath. In my well-shone shoes and button-up shirt I was more than a little overdressed for a nature hike. I could have bothered to care about looking strange while passing all those sporty people in their supportive footwear, their short-sleeved shirts, their shorts, and that zen-like outdoorsy quality I have only ever tolerated in acquaintances. But it was a nice day! I didn’t feel like skipping out on a pleasant walk just because I didn’t have workout clothes with me or whatever. After the walk, I heard back from the place in Northern Virginia where, earlier in the day, I had interviewed. I was being extended a job offer. Yay! The part of the next several hours that was not spent driving back to Maryland was spent thinking about and consulting with others about what sort of pay I should ask for and how I should respond if they offered a low number. The following days were about taking care of other types of business relevant to this whole relocating and starting a new job just after finishing school and entering a new profession thing. The next thing I know, I’ve gone days and days without moving my bookmark, and then I’m in a Barnes and Noble browsing the business section from top to bottom, for reasons I’m not going to go into yet, and one lone book, as I skim through it, seems pretty interesting to me. I decide that this will replace To the Lighthouse as the first installment of The Indirect Review of Books I am going to begin writing about; it’s Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made, Not Managed, by Alexis Ohanian. But then, after a few hundred words, I get distracted. And even this doesn’t actually become the first installment; not really. 2 Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She’s “Learned” by Lena Dunham. I’ve always been neurologically funny, although no one ever looked into it much. When I was eleven years old or something like that, I began clearing my throat on a near-constant basis. It was annoying to everyone, and it worried me. What was happening in my throat? Obviously something was in there, some growth or obstruction or irritated area. But the pediatrician who looked in my throat said that there was no physical reason for me to be throat-clearing, and that the belief I needed to do it was all in my head. My mother and I were told that nothing could be done for my problem, and so we just waited the seven or eight years it took until the frequency of that, my compulsive eye-rolling, and my repetitive nodding of the head subsided in frequency. That was how I grew up with undiagnosed Tourette’s Syndrome. Like a couple other basic facts about my life, this sort of sounds like it should be impossible. But that’s what happened. There are still times in an average day when I start throat-clearing, but this seems to be dietary, like a sort of acid reflux thing? And probably that’s connected to years of irritation as well. At least I’d say my voice is still in pretty good shape. But anyway. Another thing I know about myself is that I get what I think of as superficial anxiety. It’s probably just my own experience of what usually gets called social anxiety, but it feels weird because underneath how I present my thoughts are pretty settled, and in a way I feel just fine. My nervousness makes itself known through my shifting posture, through changes in the pitch of my voice, and things like that. I oscillate between steady eye contact, no eye contact, and darting my eyes around. But it feels like there’s no cognitive aspect to this. I’m not fixating on any particular thoughts. I’m not self-defeating. It’s like shivering because of the cold, except instead, I’m fidgeting on a coffee date. And fidgeting on a coffee date is exactly what I find myself doing on a Friday afternoon in October of the year 2014 on a planned stop along the drive from the DC area to the Pioneer Valley in western Massachusetts. * The person I stopped here to meet walks me back to my car—which is only going to be my car for another day or two, since the reason I’m driving it to Massachusetts is to hand it over to my mother. The coffee date and I share a cordial, one-and-a-half-armed hug. This coffee date and I have been spending a wacky amount of time text messaging each other these past two weeks, and in the midst of all this texting I’ve also kept accidentally dialing her up on the phone. Usually I noticed and ended the call before it rang. Once, I left a several-minutes-long voicemail of the sounds of the inside of a burrito place. But also, one night, I ended up in a fun late-night conversation that felt, at least to me, like a natural extension of those texts we were sharing—jokey and witty, but also with curiosity and the asking of deep-ish questions to each other. So it feels weird that she’s not going to express any interest in knowing me from this point forward. And even though I’ve enjoyed these few hours and we had seemingly good conversations, that’s the sense I’m getting from the tenor of this goodbye. As if driving to New England from the mid-Atlantic weren’t enough of a bummer. Most likely, I think to myself, what ruined our date was that nonverbal weirdness of mine, that superficial anxiety. Of course, there are other possibilities. Maybe I didn’t look in person quite the way I did in my pictures. Maybe it was something specific that I had said. Although it doesn’t matter at this point, I’m only human, and I think about these things as I continue to drive north. It wouldn’t have felt so surprising to have a date feel like this if she and I had not spent so, so much time learning about each other before we met. Should I have spent all that time getting to know someone from another city, someone I had never interacted with in person? Actually, I think the answer is yes. It’s like I said to someone else I met recently: “We have so little time to do all the things there are to do in this world! We have so little time to even be ourselves that it’s like… we’re basically already dead. We’re just all dead already. We’ve run out of time. ” You sort of had to be there, but I had the other person totally cracking up over that statement. * Still, I learned something from my coffee date, something that had nothing to do with me and what she did or did not like about me. That thing is: Skill is short-term. And here’s what I mean. While talking about her past successes bringing together artists, I made what I thought was a simple observation, that as she moves on in her life she’ll benefit from the skills and experience she has gained in her previous ventures. But she stopped me and said, a bit sharply, “Well. The next thing I do won’t be in the same context. I’ll be older and my peers will be older. It might be in a different city. It’ll never be the same ingredients I was working with the last time. ” So, I drive away to Massachusetts. I drop off the car for my mom—she’s going to own it, now—and I hang out with Salma, one of my dearest friends, and the crowd she has brought out to celebrate her birthday weekend. I have a fantastic time. Then, reflecting to myself on that idea of how and when the skills we develop are able to help us, I send a text message—to myself this time—of the following thought: Skill is a privilege to have and utilize. And like all other privileges, it is context-dependent. It will necessarily be altered by the movements of culture and circumstance. Skill is short-term, and what we learn we learn only within the rules of the present game, the present moment. I fly back to DC, take the Metro to my stop in Arlington, and then hope to myself, silently, as I roll my luggage off the top of a very long, very tall escalator, that I’m not becoming a horrible person. 3 The Indirect Review of Books: Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon Say what you will about the Greyhound bus; for me it’s Old Faithful. It’s like the old living room stereo system with gigantic speakers that never excelled but never completely stopped working, either. Travel like this is the way of the beatnik, the troubadour, the parole violator. It was also the way of the twentieth century me—the skinny teenager hugged by what I imagine was a formidable odor of cigarette smoke, more cigarette smoke, gas station coffee, and SweetTarts candy. Today’s bus takes me from D. C. to New York. I’m going to New York because, well… mostly just because I can. I’m earning money now, in amounts sufficient to expand my ambitions past the realm of subsistence and into the more fancypants levels of Maslow’s hierarchy. And for an American, I think, a basic familiarity with New York City is a nice thing to have. And although I grew up less than three hours away by car, and although I have visited in passing many various times for things like going to music and theatre shows, hanging out with friends, making transit connections, seeing a taping of The Colbert Report that one time, or just to walk around by myself for an afternoon, New York has never been one of my cities. It has never been mine in the way Portland or Philadelphia or Seattle or even Boston or Baltimore still sort of feel like mine when I return there. And certainly it will never be what Northampton, Massachusetts was for me, for a time. Still, I’m not dead yet, and to be honest, I don’t even feel close to done with collecting cities at this point. And there are things about me, ways I have that make me someone who probably should have a few more profound New York experiences under his belt than I actually have. So, here I am. I didn’t even take a day off work—I just started my week on Sunday and ended it on Thursday, because my new job is flexible like that. And now I’m on the bus, and someone is sitting next to me in an arrangement which restricts my movement and prevents me from feeling comfortable enough to write into a notebook while we ride. But that’s okay. That’s what usually happens. I settle into my seat, listening to podcasts, and surely enough, the time passes. Maryland becomes Pennsylvania becomes New Jersey, and eventually the bus’s destination comes into sight. One World Trade Center has been built. It’s not my first time seeing it completed, but I’m still getting used to it. The massive crane that seemed forever to be at its top is gone. Now it looks permanent. The new skyscraper at the site that was, the last time I made the effort to go and visit it, still known as Ground Zero is an actual part of the skyline, as permanent-looking as a skyscraper can look. Okay. Fine, then. This just another indication that I’m living in the future. It’s Friday, the 12th of December, 2014. The first thing I do is eat a cheeseburger at that grill at the Port Authority and pretend not to hear the guy at the table next to me as he riffs on how I am eating my burger so neatly, just like a white person, whereas in his mind it’s not a burger unless it’s smothered with toppings and condiments and dripping all over his hands. Then I go to the top of the Empire State Building by myself, alone, just the way I most often prefer to be. All around me my fellow visitors speak to each other in Scottish accents here, the German language there, some other language I’m too ignorant to identify the next group over. That’s something I have always liked about tourist destinations, be they the Space Needle or Walden Pond—although the people there have come from countries many thousands of miles apart, the Japanese tourist and the Danish tourist have more commonalities than differences when they visit this sort of place. They all want to look out. They all want to know which river is the Hudson; they all want to know which way is Brooklyn. It’s a reminder that people are just people, even if our cultures and economies and governments keep us divided, unequal, so terrified of leaving our station that we enshrine whatever role we have managed to play that feels halfway genuine into that absurd mechanism called identity. * Then I go to the Jane, my hotel in the West Village, which I guess was a single-room occupancy lodging until it became clear that $100 a night for a room the size of a queen-sized bed (not including a queen-sized bed, but including a twin-sized bed and a small space to walk alongside it) would be a good deal in Manhattan. It works for me. I leave my clothes and stuff like that—not that I’ve brought much—and head out back uptown to walk speedily through Christmas throngs. I find hundreds of people moving about all too slowly around Rockefeller Center, convinced by some process beyond my ken that a tree they have seen on television will be somehow more interesting if they see it in person. If they are disappointed by the fact that it is indeed just a freaking Christmas tree, few show any indication. Anyway. I walk quickly, even by Manhattan standards, and most of my reason for heading to Fifth Avenue, where so many people I don’t understand are shopping, is to be able to lose myself in the flow of fast walking through such crowds. Sneaking past a family on their left side, cutting right past women in impractical heels, worming directly through a roadblock of inert businessmen, this is both a skill and a sport to me. It’s not my first time doing this in December in New York, when it’s cold enough that I can move easily in my peacoat and never break a sweat, but also warm enough that I can do it for hours without developing the minor frostbite I used to take for granted as a New Englander who took walks on even the coldest of nights. After ninety minutes of this, though, I feel ready to hop on the subway to go somewhere different. * Like Columbia University. Just because I’ve never been. It feels empty, maybe because everyone’s shut inside their dorms studying for finals, and maybe because I’m comparing it to the crowd in front of FAO Schwartz two weeks before Christmas. But I think it’s also that the neighborhood is an academic island of sorts, that that’s just what things are like here. I walk the campus. I walk the neighborhood. I walk, walk, walk, and I drink coffee, because that’s just what I do. It’s what I’ve been doing for years, wherever I’ve been allowed, wherever I’ve had the means to be. It’s how I figure out what a place is and how it fits into my current understanding of life and the universe. Inherent Vice, the new film by Paul Thomas Anderson after the Thomas Pynchon novel, has opened in New York (and Los Angeles, too, I imagine) a month before other markets get it. So I’m making this a part of my weekend. The 11:50 PM showing at the Angelika Film Center in Soho seemed like the most absurd screening to buy advance tickets to, so that’s what I’m going to, post-power nap, having made it back to the Jane successfully. I am satisfied by the film. In general I do not have it in me to directly critique the creative works of artists I do not know personally, and I feel qualified least of all to critique films. Because, really. Levi Adams, who has shot nothing more videographically sophisticated than his six-year-old cousins pretending to be time travelers (and this when I myself was also six) is going to run off at the mouth about how the guy who directed There Will Be Blood could have better adapted the work of the guy who wrote Gravity’s Rainbow? I’d rather just tell you how delighted I was in that dark theatre to be tossing buttered popcorn into my mouth, knowing that when the movie ended at 2:30 in the morning I was going to be walking back to my tiny little bed to sleep as late as I wanted, to do whatever I wanted the next day. And the next day? I had planned to work it into my schedule to see a record release show for an indie-label pop-punk band I like at a DIY venue in Brooklyn. There were a couple of other acts I was interested in seeing who were going to be performing there as well, and the whole thing sounded incongruous enough with my life’s current normal to be entertaining. But as the day went on I didn’t actually feel like catching a train out that way. I found that I preferred to sit and write and to venture to various coffee places that charged $4 for drip coffee, and to walk along the High Line listening to music and darting impatiently around happy couples, and eventually even to walk down through TriBeCa, embarrassed to feel drawn by that new skyscraper, but at least listening to current music in my ear buds while thinking about my future, and thinking about our future, the future of you and me and the people our lives connect with, and how some of it is in your past and some of it is in your future and I suppose some of it is even in my past, too. Then I am back at home, “home” being what unfamiliar beds always feel like to me, and I am trying not to stare at my unflatteringly-postured reflection in the wall-sized mirror in that 50 square foot hotel room in that chilly, aristocratic theme party known as Manhattan. No one has told me to move to New York in a while, so there is nothing about the city that I feel I have to fight against. At least, not for now. So, this is my getaway. This is what I do for fun. It’s just me making me happen, and I’ve never regretted that so far. On Facebook, after nightfall, I read something about a protest. Something about the killings by police that have made it into the news lately. Black Lives Matter, goes the hashtag. Once again I have missed the opportunity to be on the streets for something like this. 4 LiterAres Literary Podcasts: The Indirect Review of Books, An Imperfect Dance: Original Stories, The Life Story, Wilting Lily Presents Levis of Grass, The And So Forth Show.

    "body": "6	The Indirect Review of Books: Atonement, by Ian McEwan. 	When things do not go according to plan that is, of course, normal. It is precisely because bending the future to your will is such a bizarre and amazing thing to be able to do that we end up obsessed over it, wringing our hands over whether or not we will ever achieve our goals. If you come from a place of powerlessness—and all of us sort of do, really, since we need to be children before we are adults—there is always going to be a sparkle of magic around the edges of whatever you achieve. So it happens that the most satisfying part of a long-planned vacation can, in certain ways, just be that moment when an airline employee casually scans your ticket and lets you onto the plane instead of telling you, “No. Go home. Get back to your normalcy. ” It’s fantastic, after you have made the bold move of giving yourself permission to be right where you want to be, to have that moment when you secure the world’s permission, too. 	Plenty of things have not gone as planned during these last few months. But far more notable are all the things that have gone as planned. I’ve gotten really good at researching wild possibilities, plotting a course that I can reasonably expect will bring those possibilities to life, and then realizing, one night when I wake up at midnight, after four hours’ sleep, knowing that I need to be at work in the morning, that the things I am doing now match pretty much exactly those plans that a year ago were so bold and so weird that I would hesitate to tell anyone at all about them. *	Yesterday I listened to the first episode of Serial, which everybody has been talking about. It’s an NPR thing, associated with This American Life. It was well done, but I still have a general aversion to crime stories. Pretty much all of us have the same response when we hear about violent criminals roaming our streets unpunished: we want those criminals to be taken down, to be arrested, to be punished. And we say that it’s justice we’re looking for, but I’m not convinced we don’t just want the excuse to call someone an animal—to look at them and to feel with complete certainty that they don’t deserve to be free. 	We want to feel like we’re living in a world we know the rules to—one where we’re safe and aren’t just going to be senselessly killed one day. But here in the U. S. , while we obsess over the thought of outlaws murdering us or our loved ones, we won’t talk so much about all the senseless deaths that aren’t caused by terrorists or psychopaths. We think it’s radical and scary even to discuss the casualties of civilization, and for that reason, I think, our laws and our culture, our controversies and the stories on the nightly news are fairly arbitrary. The passionate disagreements we have on each other’s Facebook posts don’t usually have all that much to do with why we overwork ourselves and exploit and abuse our neighbors and blame the losers of this capitalist game for their own enslavement by the prison system and/or for the self-destructive lifestyles that to them are the only visible alternative to continuing penury, inconsequence, social isolation, and dehumanizing toil. Our society kills. Our elected officials kill. Astonishingly for the twenty-first century, our judges can even kill. We are all part of this thing called self-governance, and we kill through our norms and institutions. Focusing on the drama of the individual killer while ignoring the social context feels like watching a glacier sink in the Arctic and trying to figure out which of the other glaciers didn’t do its job of staying cold enough. *	On January 14, 2015, an airline employee casually scans my ticket. She doesn’t tell me no. I board an airplane at Reagan National Airport. My first destination is Portland, Oregon. 	How is this all happening? How do I get to work so much, to decide so much, to take so many trips, to worry so little? 	I take with me on the plane the first of the novels I need to read for the upcoming semester. In addition to my full-time day job I’m in a Master’s degree program for Writing, concentrating in Fiction, taking classes at night. 	The passenger jet speeds forward, lifts up from the tarmac, and rises through light precipitation into the clouds. I love the clouds. I love the clouds, even though I can never stay in them. I can only look up at them from under their shadow until I pass through, blind for a moment, and then look down, then blinded by the sun, suddenly aware of what was on the other side all along. 	And fly. 7	The Indirect Review of Books: Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life, by Anne Lamott. 	The next time I sit down to write I’m in the laundry room of the downtown Vancouver Hostelling International. Finally, for the first time in my life, I have a stamp on my passport. 	Today is Sunday. From Wednesday until this morning I was in Portland, Oregon. Now I’m in Canada, a country I’ve been to before but only by land or sea, and only back when showing a U. S. driver’s license was adequate identification at such borders. This time I flew in by Canada Air from PDX, with the passport I got just a couple of years ago at the ready. And I arrived having to do laundry and having to shave and having to purchase a replacement for the cell phone charger I forgot in a hotel room last night. 	All of that stuff gets done pretty quickly—with plenty of time still left for me to head out and take in the Vancouver nightlife—but the dryer takes a while, and I get the chance to initiate my little purple pocket-sized notepad by setting down these words for you. These are words to introduce the setting of the latest episode of the Indirect Review of Books. Having scribbled down a few paragraphs, I smile, then look up, see that my clothes appear to be ready, and place the notebook back in my pocket. *	I was the happiest I’ve ever been in my life in Portland, for those four and a half days. I realized this by the end of my first day there. 	Julian met me at the airport. There he was, standing just past the exit from the secure area or whatever you call it. He stood as straightly as ever—quality posture is one lasting benefit of having a metal rod fused to your spine—and with an affect that shifted from relative flatness to a controlled smile he saw me approaching. 	As he and I had previously discussed, the sharing of a lasting and emphatic hug was overdue. So we shared one. I’m fairly skilled at the art of genuine and affectionate hugging; he is as well. So, together, our hugs are more or less able to bend that fabric of false pretense from which a large portion of human interaction is woven. It was a good hug. 	The weather on this first day was quite nice for a Portland January. As we rode the MAX south from PDX, my attention was divided between catching up with my dear friend Julian, whom I’ve known for eleven years now, and staring at the landscape of Oregon, which is dear to me in a different way, and which I’ve known for thirteen and a half years. 	We rode the MAX until we were downtown. I only had one wheeled carry-on bag and one Whole Foods grocery bag with me; these were not an oppressive burden for me as we walked, more or less improvisationally, past Powell’s, down Burnside, past the Civic (where I crashed on a couch back in 2001, when it was just cheap apartments and not storefronts with luxury condominiums extending high above them). After a walk up NW 21st led us over to NW 23rd we sat down for a meal at the McMenamin’s up there. Then we made our way back slowly, very slowly by a combination of walking and busing, to his place just off Hawthorne, near Mt. Tabor, a part of the city where I spent a lot of time in 2009, back when I lived and worked in the city for four months or however long that was. 	And even after we arrived at his place and I set down my bags, the night continued. We went to his usual karaoke spot. He sang; I didn’t. I smiled, and I nuzzled him as we sat watching the other singers. And our bus driver was the same on the way back as on the way there, and we could tell that she remembered us. 	And then we were back at his place, where we had immensely enjoyable sex. And when the night ended, it was only the end of night one. There was so much more left to go. I had woken up in my quiet, expensive one-bedroom apartment in Arlington, Virginia. Now I was in Julian’s bed. So happy to be there, and so happy to know that Rosalyn would be arriving the next day. 	So happy to be in Portland, where I could feel like I made sense. Happy. Happy. And it was a happiness that would continue over the next few days. The happiest I had ever been. 8	The Indirect Review of Books: Asterios Polyp, by David Mazzucchelli. 	I have been dreaming of your ghost, lonely and dreaming of the west coast. Or so goes the song that just began in this sporty pub on Davie Street in downtown Vancouver. That song is by the band Everclear. I can’t remember if I ever saw them live at any of those open air radio station concerts I went to back in the ’90s. Maybe. This song, “Santa Monica”, is probably my favorite of theirs, in any case. 	Vancouver is nice. It’s a city with great waterfront views, with a lovely and gigantic park in the middle of it, and it seems unlikely to kill you. It’s subdued, less infecting than, say, Montreal, but the climate is probably perfect by my standards and I’ve lucked out, arriving during a string of dry and perfectly comfortable days. 	So, yeah. That’s Vancouver. But what I was writing about before I decided to move from the last bar to the one I am in now was the city that is currently being pushed by posters as a quirky tourist destination at seemingly every bus stop here—Portland, Oregon. 	(Although, before I return to writing about that, I will mention that the same women’s tennis match is on here, and the player I was silently rooting for earlier—the one with the unfriendly, even wounded-looking face, who wears shorts instead of a skirt—has taken the lead. )	Julian says that my memory is notably poor for things I have said in the past. My memory is good, however, for places in Portland, and one of the many times I proved this was on the morning of day two of my visit there, when I directed us from the house Julian shares with various roommates to a nearby coffee place I remembered. I got a breakfast sandwich on a plain bagel, remarked as I always do on Julian’s strange and persistent refusal to become a coffee drinker, and then the two of us hopped on a bus and made our way to the airport. 	Waiting for Rosalyn’s plane to arrive, I found myself able to achieve my one-day-old ambition of combining a macaron with a macaroon into a delicious, smooshed-together macaron macaroon. 	Rosalyn’s first impression of Portland proved to be super-extremely rainy. We kind of got stuck, in fact, in a particularly heavy rain as we crossed the Morrison Bridge after getting off the MAX. Once on the west side we found a place to eat pizza and chat. Then we went to Powell’s, where it took me longer than either Rosalyn or Julian to be ready to leave. Water kept falling from the sky, and the transition between the dark day and the even darker night happened well before I could feel ready for it. We all took the bus back to Julian’s, riding along with a few dozen thrift-store-clothes-wearing, art-making, community-building young adults. 	Rosalyn appreciated the opportunity to look inside Julian’s place. She admired the style of construction. “This is basically every house in Portland,” I said. “I know!” she enthuses. “I’ve been looking in the windows. ”	Then Rosalyn and I made the fairly long bus ride up to Alberta to the tiny house hotel we were staying at. Although climbing down the ladder from the lofted second bed was a bit harrowing, it was sort of a dream come true for Rosalyn just to be in the place. Rosalyn had been obsessed with tiny houses for years at this point, but she had never actually previously been inside one. 	We met Julian that same night at a gothic/industrial dance night at the Lovecraft Bar, which, yes, was in fact an H. P. Lovecraft-themed bar with a dance floor. I had drinks there plus spent a song or two on the dance floor with Julian. I offered Rosalyn the chance to dance, but she had scratched whatever small itch she may have had to dance to The Cure or whatever back when I took her to that not quite goth but close enough night in Northampton that one time. 	I ordered a cab using my phone and got Rosalyn and me back to what she at least once during the trip slipped and called “home”. Julian, who was going in a completely different direction, went to wait for the next bus. 	The next day, after breakfast at a place on Alberta, I took Rosalyn up to Coffee Time—which I had to admit no longer felt familiar, having been renovated in various ways and also now serving a different kind of coffee, changing the smell so that it no longer triggered unintentional memories in the way it always had before. 	Another spot I remembered visiting in Portland before also happened to be of special interest to Rosalyn: the so-called witches’ castle in Forest Park, which I had been led by the hand along pitch black trails to in the middle of the night on the summer solstice in the year 2001. Rosalyn had seen the structure on the TV show Grimm, which is filmed in Portland. Walking uphill quickly became an issue for her, however, so our plans have to change. We get what is possibly the best ice cream ever at the Salt and Straw. 	Having about two hours to spare, we saw and enjoyed the movie The Skeleton Twins. Then, with Julian, we saw a show by Counterfeit Cash, the local Johnny Cash and June Carter tribute band. 	Rosalyn said at one point, “I think we had some poly people in front of us. They were going back and forth between each other, kissing. I’ve never seen that sort of thing in public before. ”	The next day was something completely different—a day with a rental car. It was raining again. The previous day had been clear, but the sky was now brutally emptying its clouds upon us again. 	As I write this in the present tense I am at a restaurant in downtown Vancouver. This is slightly too fancy a place for me; I probably should have walked farther and gone to someplace cheaper. There have been weeks in my life when the food and drink I’ve lived off have cost me less than the meal and two glasses of wine I just got for myself. I am sure that I like the freedom of not being poor, but when I drop $50 CAD on a solo dinner it doesn’t make me feel special. Instead, it kind of makes me feel like an asshole. And it makes me think of all the wonderful people I would like to share these privileges with. 	I have to share these privileges. Not just the money—money is, once you have enough to sustain a routine, more a distraction, more just numbers on paper than anything else—but the privileges themselves. The access. The ethos. The wisdom. The savoir faire. 	I don’t know. But I drove Rosalyn past waterfalls outside of Portland. Just… waterfall after waterfall. This after the Summit View turned out to be so oppressive, so windy and wet, as to be an adrenaline rush, although it was closed and we didn’t get the view of the Columbia River Gorge we would have seen on a clearer day. 	Then we went for a goodbye drink with Julian at some I want to say soccer bar, which was the first spot we noticed didn’t seem too crowded as we drove around. 	And while Rosalyn sat, presumably bored in that rental car, a Chrysler, I kissed Julian goodbye. I also told him I loved him, in so many words, for the first time in many years. 	And the next day, after we got some Voodoo Doughnuts, Rosalyn flew back to Orange County, and I flew north to Canada. 	Where, holy crap, I am now. Holy crap. I’m in Vancouver right now. I’m living. My heart is pumping. And I’m here. *	Night one in Vancouver saw me setting my things down inside a locker at the hostel, then heading to what the Internet told me was a dance party but what turned out actually to be a comedy improv night. The show was more than half over, so I was let in free. I sat at the bar, ordered a wine, dropped a loonie in the tip jar, and enjoyed the show. 	From there I got to the local weekly gothic/industrial dance night, which I also got into free because the cover was waived after midnight. I danced there—a lot—thrilled by the unfamiliar yet good music being played and happy also to sit with my wine when I wasn’t dancing, just staring off into space and thinking over what I want to do with myself, what my next five years or so are going to look like, and how to die old with few to no significant regrets. 	I like goth nights and lament their decreasing popularity. For the most part, at that sort of event, nobody really bothers anyone else, and everyone’s invited to just do their thing. There are no rules to goth dancing, and as long as you don’t come as part of a group that looks like they would have bullied the goths in high school, no one’s going to look askance at you. 	I take a cab back to the hostel, where I sleep surprisingly well on my top bunk until the morning. Then I get up, shave my face, and visit the front desk so I can switch over to the private room I’ve booked for my second day in town. 	My second and third day in Vancouver were mellow. On the second day I walked through Stanley Park, along some of the beaches and around the Lost Lagoon. I napped in the afternoon, and when night came I headed to Funky Winker Bean’s, a punk/metal kind of dive, to see what was up with the karaoke they advertised. I got there and nothing seemed to be happening yet. Three people in a room full of like ten patrons independently came up and talked to me uninvited—one to comment with appropriate brevity about something something karaoke, I dunno, he was drunk, a second person to say something something, I dunno, he was speaking unintelligibly, and a third person who said that when I walked in he thought I was a particular supporting cast member from the American version of the show The Office (and he showed me a picture, too, but now, no matter how much I google, I can’t seem to figure out who it was). 	So, anyway. After one beer I left the bar, then went to a couple of other places, where I just nursed some additional beers and wrote. 	The next day, I visited the beautiful UBC campus, including a visit to the Museum of Anthropology there. Then I spent the rest of the night writing, pretty much. *	I also found myself in—is it possible that in North America I had accidentally found, in the span of four days, a second soccer bar? For the same reason as last time: because the other spots I had walked past had been usually too crowded, and sometimes just too unappealing in some other way (e. g. , too many patrons wearing baseball caps). But at this second soccer bar, this Canadian soccer bar, I arrived just as the only two other tables of customers were leaving. 	Like so many folks here, the guy behind the counter has an accent from I’m not sure what country, but somewhere in Europe, I suppose. I ask him for the washroom, although in the States I would have used our preferred term, “restroom”. 	Then. Then I’m in a stall. Because fuck urinals. I’m in a stall, completely enclosed. All the walls surrounding me are maple leaf red, except for the four-and-a-half-foot-long silver door handle and, on either side of me, at the far rear of the stall, two thin strips of mirror, which reflect my reflection of my reflection of my reflection of my reflection if I lean back while sitting on the toilet and urinating. 	In this stall—which is, by the way, freakishly well lit by a bright light directly above it—I find what I have been looking for. Every aspect of this strange space cooperates with every other of its aspects, with the result being that I know not just who I am but exactly—exactly—where I am in the context of that being. 	Tennis is on the television again. It really is all sports all the time at every public house with television screens I go to in this city. The only exception was the goth night, which played scenes from various dark, fantastical, or just plain excellent movies including Constantine, Snowpiercer, and Maleficient. What I’m watching is the Australian Open, I now realize. Tonight it’s a men’s match. 	A lyric came to mind while I was in that red bathroom stall, from the Of Montreal song “Wintered Debts”: “Tried to call you from a bathroom in São Paulo, but I was too drunk to formulate any sort of earthly language. ” I was and am at least still sober enough to communicate at a fairly high level, and Canada is not Brazil, but the isolation of a foreign washroom with a built-in mirror at least was enough to bring the lyric to mind. Anyway. Now this empty bar with framed photos of soccer matches on the walls is playing the Of Montreal song “Disconnect the Dots” while in Australia, where it is both daytime and summer, a dark-skinned guy and a light-skinned guy each try to hit a ball past the other player. 	The bartender said it was last call, so I guess I have to go now. Oh, well. 	I wish I could just hang out a little longer. I wish I could make this leisurely visit to this city last just a little bit longer	by writing about	every little thing that crosses my mind. "

    "title": "XXII. A Man's Look Completes Itself (9-21)",
    "body": "9 Jan. 25, 2015. “Are you an attorney?” asks the guy at the hair salon in Virginia as I sit down in his chair for a cut. I laugh. “No. Why do you ask?” “You look like you could be an attorney. ” “And what does an attorney look like?” I’m amused and expect now that this stylist and I will be bantering. Instead, he just says, “I don’t know. The hair slicked back. There are a lot of attorneys in this area. ” “Yeah, that’s true,” I say. From that point on he cuts my hair in silence. 10 Feb. 16, 2015. Rosalyn calls me. It’s late afternoon here, and I’m lying down to nap. “Do you have some time to talk?” “Yeah,” I say. “What’s going on?” I’m able to tell that it’s serious. It’s her mom, of course. The latest round of chemotherapy has ruined her liver. The doctors are saying one to four months. I talk to her about coming out here. I tell her that I’m sure she could take some time off from school if she talked to them. Even if it’s just a week or whatever. But she’s in shock, not in problem-solving mode yet. So I listen, and I say vague words of support. 11 I haven’t been doing this since I returned from the northwest, but in the fall I was going on dates. There was the coffee date in Harrisburg whom I met and disappointed on my way north to Massachusetts that one weekend. Also there was the twenty-three-year-old Psychology grad student—I was surprised by the sudden turn from her, the email from her saying something had come up and she would contact me after the holidays, which she didn’t do. And what was the name of that woman, also younger, with whom I had that lovely Scrabble game at Busboys and Poets? But then she and I went to the National Portrait Museum and I was just so weird, so nervous, as is becoming a chronic problem for me these days. And before that was the woman who kissed me after my first date, but then we went to the Maryland Ren Faire and I don’t know, maybe she thought I was crazy because I dressed all in black. There was the night I went speed dating, which I thoroughly enjoyed although I had no matches in the online system used to contact people after. There have been some people I’ve managed to get on with, though. Nirma has been a good concert buddy. Sheila, forty-eight years old, was good conversation on our couple of nights out. 12 I worked on Sunday so as to take Wednesday, Feb. 18 off. This date is the on-sale for individual tickets to this year’s Burning Man. In front of my recently-purchased Lenovo Windows 8 touch-screen laptop I open a web site that purports to give the correct current time. This allows me to press “enter” and connect to the ticket buying page just as 12:00 Pacific Time hits. After a process of waiting in queue I am directed to the page that allows me to purchase two tickets—one for me and one for Julian—at a price of $390 each. 13 “I’m proud of you,” Rosalyn has been saying to me, about how I’ve responding (through the proper corporate channels) to the apparent forgery of my name in the records at my work, and how I’ve been responding (mostly through confidently-written emails) to the hostility and insult I’ve encountered from both the director of rehab at my facility and from the area manager since I began to take note of the inappropriate documentation I’ve been asked to do. “I’m proud of you for standing up for yourself. ” And just as I have felt my perception of myself affected positively by Rosalyn’s interpretation of my life story as a slow but impressive rise from hardship and lack of privilege in my teens and twenties into accomplishment and security in my thirties, this new idea—that I should feel proud of sticking up for myself in my dealings with individuals who are trying to fuck with me—might signal a sea change in what I believe is possible for myself. 14 “Hey! Do you mind if I sit with you while I wait for the restroom?” “No, go ahead. ” Not looking up from my copy of A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan. The location is Northside Social, the coffee shop down the street from my apartment in Arlington. “What are you drinking there?” “A cup of tea,” I say. “What kind of tea?” “Some sort of oolong. ” “Sounds good. ” “Yeah. So far, so good. ” “Jasmine pearl, that’s my favorite. ” “All right. ” “Restroom is open now. ” “All right. Have a good night. ” I sit around for maybe an hour or so longer, reading for class. Eventually a conversation that has developed at one of the tables next to me catches my ear. The speaker is a man in his twenties, addressing a woman in her twenties: “…this guy who, like, processes all the Fulbright applications, and he’s always saying, like, Harvard had some researchers, and they did this study where every, maybe it was like every half year they looked at, and it was like, a Kennedy… there was a nice, diverse group of people they were looking at. So they wanted to see what factors made it more likely for them to be happy at the time that they died. So they expected that people would be happiest if they, you know, didn’t drink and ran every day, but when they looked at it it was like, one half of the people who were happiest were obese drunks, and the other half were exercising, never smoked, and all of that. And the guy who did the study recently died and his last interpretation of the study was just that it’s how you handle, I mean, you’re not going to be able to stop being alone, so it’s how you handle when things go wrong…” Then a couple, a man and a woman, are waiting for the two restrooms, which I’m at the table closest to. They ask each other whether it’s likely that the restrooms require a key. Inevitably, since neither of them know the answer, they ask me whether I know. “There’s no key,” I say. “So if the doors don’t open, there must be people in both of them. ” The woman says something to the man, who says to her, “That would be a dick move, though, if you did need a key, and you just made someone wait. ” But the sound of a hand dryer soon is audible through one of the doors. “Stop washing your hands,” says the woman, as if to the person in the restroom. “I don’t care about you drying your hands. ” I suspect she might wish for me to smile and/or look over to acknowledge her. But I just sit, staring at the paper I’m trying to scribble onto. 15 Recent shows attended include stand-up from Pete Holmes at the DC Improv (funny!); Of Montreal at the 9:30 Club (artsy-weird!); Kitten at the Rock and Roll Hotel (a little known young Los Angeles band playing at a cool little hole in the wall in NE DC!); Perfect Pussy in the back stage of the Black Cat (enjoyably loud, noisy, punk, and of the moment, but all the flash photography in that small room kept blinding me and really took away from the night!); Andrew Jackson Jihad and the Smith Street Band and Jeff Rosenstock and Chumped at the Baltimore Soundstage (an all-around wonderful time!). 16 Apr. 1, 2015. I’m supposed to have someone call me from a nearby home health agency that likes to hire through travel agencies for six month contracts. I’m told they’ll call around 9 in the morning. After 10:00 I text the people at the travel company and say that I’m sorry, but I’m already quite late for work and will not be able to wait any longer. I’m told that I’ll get a call between 5 and 6 in the afternoon instead. At 5:45, that window is expanded out to 7. No one calls. The other interview I have, a quick phone screen for a skilled nursing facility, is one I am much less interested in, but at least they call me at the time we have planned for. 17 Apr. 2. As I drive to work I get a text from the travel company, telling me the client company would like to call to interview me this morning at 9 instead. I look at the clock and it is already 9. At a stoplight I text back “OK”. A couple of minutes later I get a call. I pull over into a parking lot and have a straightforward phone conversation about why I’m interested in home health work, what their scheduling is like, and so on. I text the travel company when I’m done. They say they’ll follow up with them. 18 After work I fall asleep early, but after two hours of sleep I am awoken by stress dreams of work. Rosalyn is online and she says she is just about to leave from the school’s computer lab to drive and would I take a phone call instead, and I say yes. I reflect for a moment about how every time of day, every season of the year feels the same here in this part of Virginia, in a building built in the twenty-first century, totally climate controlled, and in particular I miss hearing sounds of night—crickets, say, or traffic cutting through the darkness. What I hear in this apartment (where I sit on the floor, having given up on getting a couch or anything else—all I do here is sleep, read, type on a laptop, and it seems I am unlikely to entertain anyone other than brief upcoming visits Julian and Rosalyn each have planned with me, and then I am just going to move, and I’m not going to want to bring furniture with me across the country) (and anyway, I am underwhelmed by and regretful of my purchases of two stools—one of which never balanced right, the other of which has had its screws come out from the bottom already and I would have to find an allen wrench somewhere to screw them back in and the stupid thing probably won’t come apart/reassemble right anyway when I move so I’ll probably just leave them here downstairs next to the recyclables, where there are always lots of pieces of wasted furniture from the other tenants in the building) is white noise, the distant humming of a world alive. Rosalyn says that she has talked to her father and that he was not happy when she told him she would be coming out to the east coast for several days to visit her mother before her death. He feels that this will take away from her ability to focus entirely on school. (She is currently getting all ‘A’s, well in excess of what is necessary for what she is looking to get out of this program. ) So, I’m paying for her plane ticket. Actually, I don’t really have $500 right now… but once I do, I’m paying for it. 19 Salma’s baby is due in June, which is, holy shit, soon! I have plans to head up there to western Massachusetts in July, and also at that same time to spend time with Alix. 20 After seeing the Mountain Goats play the 9:30 Club on a Tuesday, meeting up with Sheila in Vienna, VA to see Nellie McKay play at a little place called Jammin’ Java. Sitting at a table just in front of the stage (“I’m not sure if you’re the poor people or the lucky people,” says Nellie to us after her Alan Price cover, noticing that we have an obstructed view during songs for which she plays the piano). Then, going to a diner down the road after, where I got an ice cream coke and Sheila just got a soda. Her talking about her kids, me prompting her with questions about philosophies of parenting. Continuing also to talk about another of my favorite topics to broach with her, the Southern-ness of Maryland and Northern Virginia, which she, a native New Englander like myself, still notices. (“I’ve kept seeing men I work with, patients, treating me so much differently than they treat the other therapists,” I say. “They have attitudes about women that are just jaw-dropping to me. ”) She sees it: attitudes about gender and race and class and tradition and lifestyle. But Frederick in particular has grown on her. She says she spent several years living in Texas, though, and that was the worst, everyone was so boastful there. 21 Doing dishes after much of, like, trying to start cleaning and then feeling a certain despair about my field of work, which I haven’t really written about, haven’t really let myself (wanted to make a podcast) (that interview I went to, the first of two in-person interviews last month or this month or whenever, for that home health job, the woman said something about doing a background check and then emphasized something about searching social networks and looking for things like people sharing all the details of their lives “as increasing numbers of people do” but then I realized that yes there was that, it was an actual accident, that I attached my full name to the podcast episodes of my Life Story, which I was starting to try to post, alternating along with the Indirect Review episodes and [I was hoping] songs I recorded as Levi Adams/Wilting Lily and also original short fiction sometimes [I posted “Eric and the Mannequins” as an episode]. So this woman sounded like she was suggesting she had found that by googling me) take the time to reflect in text on how my already difficult-to-manage sleep is troubled, now, by feelings of guilt for my work as a therapist, because so much of it feels like a way to force money out of old people and the government and the insurance companies, but either you work within a system of laws and company rules that constrict what you’re doing or else you just, y’know, quit the field, which in my case would mean no way to support myself, no way to meet my financial obligations, but I wonder how long I can do this before I hate myself and cannot take it any longer and destroy my mental health. I was thinking maybe I could buy a house in Portland this fall, a house with a little yard so Rosalyn could build a tiny house, and with multiple bedrooms so I could rent one out to Julian and have other housemates and then leave town as often as I wanted because I wouldn’t be paying the full costs of maintaining an entire house for myself but would be getting rental income. But some changes to the way government-backed FHA loans require lenders to calculate the debt-to-income ratios for applicants who have student loans in deferment (scheduled to go into effect in about two months) have changed my plans. (As I began the process of changing jobs, holding on to the contract paperwork from the travel company, Synergy Medical Staffing, which is based in the midwest and whose employees so far have been all been guys saying “Hey, man,” and “Yeah, man, totally,” to me so often that I wonder if they have anything at all to say to the women they talk to. “Hey, woman”? “Yeah, woman”?) So I even for a minute wanted to try to rush, to keep the job I have been working at the skilled nursing facility and to get my mom a condo in Northampton that she could live in, because, as she tells me, she knows she wants out of that house but doesn’t know how. (“He does his thing up there,” she says of Bruce. “He’s up there drinking vodka. ”) But then I wasn’t sure, and posts I made to forums online were getting me unhelpful and condescending replies. (Ugh, World. If only you knew how much research I must have done, how much information I must already have wrapped my head around, how specific an answer I must be looking for, if I am now throwing my question out there for you strangers to answer. ) And a new OT was starting at work just as I was leaving, anyway. And I’ve been getting so little in the way of hours, since he started and I put my notice in several days later. And the new policies resulting from my reporting the false co-signing of my name: no more proxying as other employees (whatever that practice was) and every sixty days a change of iPad password required for everyone, and Beth the area manager comes in and tells me in an open room where all the other therapists can listen that I should improve my evaluations, and voices a bunch of commonsense guidelines, so that I get the message not to challenge the hierarchy again. (My supervisor, on the other hand, suddenly stopped barking at me after a point. ) But yeah, I’ve exploded things here. And I’ll also never know what was up with the COTA, what was her problem with me. She tends to walk away before any brief exchange of information between us can turn into a conversation. So things were actually sort of exploded even before I exploded them. But I went to the physical therapists for references, because they and the speech language pathologist have been nice to me. Staying at that job would have been rough, and my mom, depressed and anxious as always, was ready to quit hunting for a place before she even started. And I never really wanted to own anything, anyway, except that if money were no object I would want one little apartment in my old neighborhood near Broad Street/Avenue of the Arts in Philadelphia and another one someplace convenient in Portland. “Studio East” and “Studio West”, as I described it to Rosalyn—both part-time locations I could stay in or let other people stay in as needed and as wanted. More importantly, though—and this has come to feel more urgent as I have been experiencing first-hand so much of the precarious and amoral culture of exploitation and pretense that is the twenty-first century American middle class—now that I can do so, I need to pursue citizenship in another country. Even if I find that where I go is no better. Because I can’t say that I know where to find my values echoed anymore. And I will always be American, the way I will always be white, the way I will always be a dropout. There are things you can never lose. But if I can be both a dropout and a graduate, both white and outside the mainstream, then I can be both American and Canadian, too. And I am starting to think—though I have told no one—that I may want children. But I would not produce children unless I knew that their opportunities would not be limited to what America would offer them. (Although I think life here is thrilling—as a ride in a carelessly-operated sports car is thrilling—I do not trust the United States with anything in need of delicate care. ) So today I began the application process to sit for the exam needed to be an OT in Canada. Fuck. I need to get back to cleaning the apartment. I work all week, then Julian arrives on Thursday. "

    "body": "22 Things that happen over the course of months get jumbled up in my head and seem to happen simultaneously. 23 Black Pen I should put the pen away that I twirl between my fingers on the ride home on the Metro that makes people think there is something wrong with me. Just kidding. I don’t really care that much.   Blue Pen “Oh, grow up. ” -Me, to a pen I just bought, upon realizing that the ink is blue, not black   The Brixton “So you’ll be happy if you never have kids, but if you meet the right person and the situation is right, you won’t rule it out?” “Well. ” I hesitate in my response. “More specifically, I’ve decided that I don’t want to have… American kids. ” I elaborate on this. It’s not that I haven’t learned to make America work pretty well for me. It’s just too precarious. To lead children born today into a relatively safe, self-sufficient adult life seems like it would require constant vigilance and a lot of good luck. “And the values,” I add. “I don’t think we have the values a country like us needs to sustain itself. ” I say that I know I haven’t traveled much at all outside of this country and that the problems of the place you come from are easier to obsess over than the problems of countries whose politics and culture you barely understand, “But… the values. ” The confusion of violence with virtue. How could that be sustainable? She’s nodding. “I have to say, based on what I’ve seen in my life and my understanding of history, that now would be a really good time to start planning for these things. I think the tensions will just keep growing. And while I think things will get better eventually, I do worry how much worse they’re going to have to get first,” Sheila, my forty-nine-year-old friend, who is divorced and has four children and who agreed to come along with me for an afternoon (4:20) taping of the Doug Loves Movies podcast at one venue then for the Australian indie rock musician Courtney Barnett at another, says to me then, as the two of us sit on a rooftop overlooking a side street in the U district at a place I later will describe on Facebook as “some British-themed bar” (which comment will result in Nirma’s comment, “The Brixton! They have an amazing gin, earl grey tea lemon drink”). But the two of us, Sheila and I, are drinking wine (hers white, mine red) and the weather is humid but not as bad as it seemed to be earlier in the day.   But My Pelvis I meant to get more done this weekend. But my pelvis didn’t want to cooperate? Suddenly, and for no apparent reason, it seemed to be in misalignment. Not a problem I’ve had before. So I tried to avoid sitting. I alternated between lying down and standing. This meant napping at random times and for random durations throughout the day and night. And now it’s an hour until my alarm goes off. I’m thinking of calling my first patient of the day to see if another day will work for him.   Cententarians The 100-Year-Old-Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared is a Swedish movie based on a novel that was a sort of picaresque with a centenarian protagonist. A first chapter I workshopped in class last semester had the same basic idea behind it, except my protagonist was ninety-nine instead of one hundred years old, and the story was to be set in the 2060s rather than the present time. Good thing I wasn’t too attached to that premise. Anyway. I’m standing with Rosalyn at Dulles International Airport, waiting for her friend Claire, whom we are picking up after her solo vacation to Toronto. While waiting for Claire to walk from her terminal and locate us, we’re trying to find a movie that is worth seeing.   Columbia University Dear Levi Adams, Congratulations! On behalf of Dean Kristine Billmyer 	and the Faculty, I wish to notify you of your admission to the Master of 	Science in Narrative Medicine program beginning Fall 2015 for Part-time 	study and welcome you cordially to Columbia University. (Et cetera!) This, after I was eating at Chipotle one day and noticed a banner ad on the New York Times site. My response to seeing it was to tap the touch screen of my laptop and to say aloud to myself, “Narrative Medicine? Shut up and take my application!” Within a couple of weeks I texted the PTs from Heritage Hall to be my recommenders. I submitted, along with those, The Wedding Story (because I needed to send some sort of written material that I could argue was vaguely related to what I was applying for) and an admissions essay.   The Final Episode of Mad Men Watched on the enclosed porch at Rosalyn’s dying mother’s house. With enchiladas and other such deliciousness. Her mom inside, watching her own TV in her living room area, in her rocking chair. With Champion, the dog, who still will not, will likely never be stopped from wetting the carpet.   Fire and Rescue He’s in a chair when I walk in. Just to the left of the side entrance to his home, down about four stairs. It’s not technically a basement, I suppose, but it feels like it. It’s a dark not-a-basement. A man of maybe three hundred pounds in a chair. “I have cats,” he says as I enter. Indeed he does; the litter boxes are overflowing. I’ve had occasion in recent years to reflect on how certain places—bars and homes alike—that I used to consider comfortable would seem disgusting to me now. Still, I’m surprised how much the conditions in this man’s house are able to make me uncomfortable. He’s in a chair, showing no indication of being able to adjust even his seated posture. I take his vitals, pushing some of the clutter on the floor out of my way. “Okay,” I say, ready to sit down on the new-looking stairlift as he has suggested, to begin asking questions. “I would like to use the bathroom first, though,” he says. “Oh! Okay,” I say. But it’s not okay. Even in my limited experience as a therapist, I have met several people who surprised me with their mobility once they made a point of choosing to move. I was thinking that this might be another of those people, someone who would look helpless at first but would actually be able to walk okay with a little support. Nope. He can’t stand up. We try many times. He can’t stand up. He slides forward in his chair. I’m worried he’s in danger of sliding off. I try to help him scoot back. This requires me trying to set my hand under him, but through his pants I can feel dampness. “Where should I wash my hands?” I ask. He says that I should use the nearest bathroom. There are paper towels, wipes, and various other items in the bone-dry sink. Although I am reluctant to touch anything else in this house, I persuade myself to lift them out of the sink so that I can wash. Fortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, there is soap. Being in this place actually makes me wonder if there might be something other than soap in the soap dispenser. There was, after all, something other than soda pop in the 2-liter bottles by his chair: he had been peeing in soda bottles and keeping the bottles on the floor next to him. But when I have braced myself and pressed down on the soap dispenser’s top, what squirts onto my hand feels sufficiently like soap for me not to freak out. I keep trying to get him to stand. I ask him to wait again while I use my phone to review the messages the nurse and physical therapist have written about their visits to him. The physical therapist wrote that he was able after a lot of time to stand up on his own using his walker. I am seeing no signs that he will able to do this here. He is asking for a bowl from the kitchen to be used as a bed pan, but I don’t even have gloves. “There might be some gloves on the table to my right,” he says. “These?” I ask, touching blue latex gloves wrapped up into a ball. “Is there any chance you used these already?” “I didn’t, but somebody else might have. ” I set the gloves down and go to the bathroom to wash my hands again. I try to think of an appropriate way to leave this situation. When I come back, I tell him, “I’m going to make a couple of calls to see what I can find out from the other people who have visited you. We have to get you to the bathroom somehow, so maybe I can even find a store to go to where I can pick up some gloves or something. But this isn’t something that I can do without gloves. ” Then I sit in the car in front of his house and try calling my one phone contact at the company I’m contracting for. I text her when she doesn’t answer. She texts that she’ll call me right back. I wait a half hour. Then I text again, asking if there’s someone else I can call instead. She calls me right away. I tell her what’s up. She says she’ll tell the scheduling nurse and have her call me. I drive back to the guy’s neighborhood, because, after all, I’ve told him I’ll be coming back. I’ve driven far enough to fill up my gas tank while waiting for a return call, but I don’t feel it would be right to move onto the next patient without resolving this. As I’m parking, the nurse calls. She says that the nurse working his case called 911 for him this morning. “I heard no mention of that,” I say. “The only person he mentioned seeing today was a social worker, I’m not sure where from. ” Anyway. We decide that I should call the local fire and rescue to come and help him. I do this. I get calls later from both the scheduling nurse and the nurse who opened his case, telling me that he was taken to the hospital. By this point I’ve canceled one of my scheduled visits and moved another to late in the afternoon, due to the time out of my day this was requiring. But the day eventually goes on, and my attention eventually goes elsewhere. He was in a chair, and he had to get out of it, so I got him out of the chair.   Georgetown Going to the AMC Loews Georgetown cinema and seeing The Avengers: Age of Ultron, a late night showing. It’s surprisingly late when we get out, well after midnight. Rosalyn doesn’t know much about this part of the city. “I’m glad I can show you around D. C. ,” I joke. She always used to talk about being from here, how this was her city, and, particularly in the early days of our knowing each other, how she would like to show me around it sometime.   Hair I need to buy a pulse oximeter. I stop into a Walgreen’s drug store I’ve never been to before. I’m all the way out in Manassas. I hear the kid at the counter tell the man in front of me that he’s seventeen, but that he just turned seventeen and so he keeps wanting to still say that he’s sixteen. When it’s my turn, he asks me, “Is Synergy a styling company?” I didn’t realize that I had left my name tag on while walking into the store. “Oh, no. ” I say. “It’s a health care company. ” “Oh, okay. I thought maybe you sold hair care products, or something like that,” he says. “Because your hair looks really good. What do you use in your hair?” This kid’s got a bright future. I can see it already.   Home Furnishing My pelvis still is giving me some pain in the morning when I wake up. Still, or again: I’m not sure which of these words to use. For the most part it’s only when I’m waking up. And it’s not a horrible pain that causes me to hunch over, like it was before, but more just a stiffness or soreness that seems gradually to work itself out as I get up and start to move. But it’s in the same spot, at my very very low back, which was bothering me before. Waking up on my mattress on the floor. This is the apartment in which finally I’ve started to feel weird about failing to populate my living space with real furniture. I think I mentioned it to Rosalyn when she came and spent that month out here on the east coast: I want this to be the last time I treat a living space like it’s just a box to sit in. What happened was familiar: I planned to bring in more furniture, but then I got busy, and soon I was already planning where I would be moving to next and I couldn’t imagine why I would want to bring in a couch or whatever only to rarely use it—I’m not exactly lounging around watching TV most days here—and then have to figure out how to move it out several months later.   HydrangeasJason says there are people getting paid twenty-five dollars an hour just for programming video games like we do. No one makes twenty-five dollars an hour, I say. They do. You might have to go to California, but they do. So I go to California. Never seen roses on a bush before. Maxine steals a red one, just plucks it like a twenty-five dollar an hour job. We eat french fries every day with her dad’s money and go check out the community college. I’ve never heard of hydrangeas. Nobody’s heard of hydrangeas.   Kaylee How is Kaylee Puppy doing? Okay, but my mom says she had to get some teeth pulled.   The Lincoln Memorial So many steps. So many parents and kids. And Julian and I. I was more interested in seeing the inside—the statue of Lincoln, and the words on the walls inside. Julian was more interested in taking a photograph from the top of the steps. This is the America that millions of people from around the world travel to visit—the one they’ve been seeing, that I’ve always wondered about. I wonder how the D. C. locals must feel about all of this.   My Diet I call the first patient I’ve scheduled for the day. It’s about 9:15 in the morning. He’s possibly still asleep. A little short with me. I ask him if we can reschedule for Wednesday, apologizing. He says fine. I go back to the windowless bedroom, where I lie down and sleep until 1:30 P. M. * Three patients today. Easy and straightforward. Scattered showers as I drive all across northern Virginia, following my admittedly poorly-planned-out schedule of visits. One evaluation, a verbally nonresponsive woman. Her daughter and one of her caregivers present, I cue her, trying to get her to actively move her limbs, with limited success. Then a visit that involves asking a woman using a walker to get to the counter, scoop herself a bowl of rice, and bring it over to where she would normally sit with it. I remind her throughout that she should not be stepping out from the walker. Then I visit a man in his sixties, who is in poor orthopedic shape for his age. A walker that a family member ordered for him arrives at the door during the visit, and while he demonstrates his arm exercises and I tweak the specifics of his home exercise program I open up the parcel and clip the tray to his walker. I’m surprised that I’m feeling fine with regard to that weird stuff that was going on with my sacroiliac joint or whatever. I’m actually bothered more by the persistence of a slight cold that I’ve had for the past week.   Nirma She joined me for an event, a comedy show at the Howard Theater, raising funds for programs supporting LGBTQ teens (through an organization called the Ally Coalition). On the bill are Rachel Dratch, W. Kamau Bell (I’m sad that his TV show was canceled, and I think he is, too), and Bridget Everett, who is last to go up and everything I had been led to expect. I have a nervous night, which I wasn’t expecting. I’m not sure what I’m afraid of. I try to think of what the younger Levi would do. Younger Levi would skip down the street, I think to myself. But I don’t do that.   The Now Picture me driving a network of identical highways in my white Chevrolet, thinking about my life, thinking about my Life Story, on the way to the Johns Hopkins University’s Washington, D. C. location for my poetry class. We all arrive prepared, having read the thick packet of photocopies of ekphrastic poems. One of the poems we are discussing is “The Knight, Death, and the Devil” by Randall Jarrell, after the print by Albrecht Dürer. And I don’t know who this other student in the class is, but we reach the point in the class discussion where we are discussing the final stanza (the “he” in which refers to the knight, while the “them” refers to Death and the Devil):  He listens in assurance, has no glance  To spare for them, but looks past steadily  At—at—          a man’s look completes itself.  The death of his own flesh, set up outside him;  The flesh of his own soul, set up outside him—  Death and the devil, what are these to him?  His being accuses him—and yet his face is firm  In resolution, in absolute persistence;  The folds of smiling do for steadiness;  The face is its own fate—a man does what he must—  And the body underneath it says: I am. Okay. So this guy in class says… wait. So, actually, the guy refers back to earlier in the poem, to part of what is written there about how Death is personified in the print:  He holds up, warning, the crossed cones of time;  Here, narrowing into now, the Past and Future  Are quicksand. So this guy says, “Death is holding up the hourglass in the hope that the knight will see time as a limited thing, with the amount that’s left getting smaller and smaller and the amount that’s done with getting greater and greater. Death wants the knight trapped at the thinnest point of the hourglass, trapped in the now, always trying to grasp but never able to hold on to that time. ” The guy’s insights are well-received, but he continues with a comment that is seemingly ignored by everyone else in the classroom. Everyone, I guess, except me: I hurry to write it down. “Everything in the poem suggests that the way to escape is a more cyclical view of time—to exist in a ring of your own creation. ”   On the Border On the Border Mexican Grill and Cantina, Woodbridge, Virginia. An end-of-work-shift plate of food, even a margarita to go along with it. Two weeks into being a home care therapist. More wonderful than not, although the job demands well over the forty hours per week I am theoretically getting paid for. Here is the best part: not having an actual workplace that I go to, and therefore not having to interact with co-workers on daily basis. The second best part: scheduling being entirely between me and the clients. (I’m trying out working shortened work hours seven days a week, the idea being that this can allow me to sleep in, then do my therapist thing, then have a sort of second act to my day still left. I have always found it a bummer to give my whole day away to a job, then to have so little energy left that I don’t get anything accomplished in evenings. I also think this will help me be better rested than that whole waking up between five and seven o’clock in the morning nonsense ever allowed me to be. )   Rosalyn’s Mom How is Rosalyn’s mom doing? Dying, but trying to continue to work until the end of the school year so that she doesn’t lose her health insurance.   Rock &amp; Roll Hotel, H Street NE Accidentally came here on the wrong night. Arrived just as a downpour started. Asked the person at the window if there were still tickets for tonight’s show. “Yeah, some guy left his,” she said. So, that’s how and why I’m seeing the band Viet Cong for free and unexpectedly tonight. (The next night, the show I meant to see—Christopher Owens—actually has a much smaller crowd. Much like when I saw the somethingteen-member Polyphonic Spree play for a half-empty club last year, I feel remarkably bad for the performers. )   Salma’s Voicemail “Hi, Levi dear! It’s me, Salma. Just trying you. I know you tried calling a few times, and it’s been so, so really busy. It’s gonna be busy, hopefully, right until the birth, assuming she doesn’t come early. Um. So, yeah, so, um, just I guess try me back and I’ll try to reach you. I’m still wrapping up at work. Thursday’s my last day. I’m supposed to get induced anytime starting Monday June 22, anytime that week, due to the gestational diabetes and the insulin. On insulin they induce you, unfortunately. Well, fortunately, I guess, because, uh, you know. Stillbirth becomes a problem after that point. Um. So, yeah, so that’s kind of the mini-update. I hope you’re doing well. Um. I miss you! I’m glad you’re actually coming a little bit later, because I think I’ll get to be a little bit more present than if you were coming early July. Um, so, yeah. So, let’s try to talk, hopefully, in the next week or two. Love you! Bye!”   Tacos Because I’ve got tacos, tacos on the brain Tacos, tacos! They’re keeping me sane Tacos, tacos! Holy fuck! Tacos are fantastic luck!   The Washington Monument “It’s funny how the color of it changes part of the way up,” says Rosalyn.   Time Travel I never knew anyone who would talk about it. I feel like there were some thoughtful discussions online here and there in the ‘90s, but the message has always been clear that it’s a national security thing. Want to be sworn to secrecy about something? Next time you’re at the doctor’s office or DMV just go ahead and check the “yes” box when they ask about hearing voices. Want things to get even more complicated than that? Hear the angels but don’t report it. Meanwhile, for people who have never heard a voice from the future in their life, there’s no reason to get mixed up in any of it. It was easier when we thought time travel meant Back to the Future. That’s the one thing we’ve always felt free to speculate about—it was July of 1985 when that movie came out, and it was that same month when people documented the first angel interventions. But you can only have that conversation so many times. There’s only interest enough for so many magazine articles. So, the angels are just another thing to figure out on my own—another lonely question of how to be.   We Saw Horses Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Still the first week of the Summer semester. I have work documentation to catch up on as well as poems to read, stories to workshop, and stories to write. But my last therapy visit of the day was all the way out in Leesburg. It’s nice weather, and I know fully well that I will be busy from now through eternity. (What’s up with the schedule for Fall classes in my program at JHU not being available yet? And there’s a mandatory orientation to the Columbia Narrative Medicine program, but I don’t have the date for it! I’m already going to have to change my return flight back from Burning Man so that it will take me to New York instead of to Washington—and I’m pretty well booked through to the start of Burning Man already, too! Of course, these are some pretty awesome problems to have. ) So, yeah. I might not hit West Virginia again until after I’ve moved away from the Mid-Atlantic region again. So here I am, getting overpriced crap coffee in a styrofoam cup at an ice cream place, sitting alone at one of the tables but not planning to stay too long because yeah, I’m sure people think I’m weird for this sort of thing. There’s not much to do in this town other than hike and go tubing down the river, anyway, however pretty it is. And here I am, moving on to a bench in the shade, next to the former site of the U. S. armory and arsenal. This national armory was the second in America’s history, the first having been in Springfield, Massachusetts. (That location has since been turned into Springfield Technical Community College, where I took the required courses to qualify for admission into occupational therapy programs in the year 2010, which already now was a while ago. ) In 1859 this was the site of John Brown’s raid, which was when a white abolitionist seized it to try to start a revolt among America’s slaves. These are interesting points that I find myself writing down, but what I really wanted to lead into somehow, as organically as possible, was a telling of Julian’s recent visit, how he and I went to Assateague Island, just off the Maryland shore, and I ended up not wanting to go and meet the people from the meetup. com group who had arranged it as a camping and hiking trip. I was like, “I’m scared,” and Julian was like, “What about when we go to Burning Man? There’ll be thousands of strangers camping all around us, then, with no backing out. ” And I was like, “But no one will be expecting me to be normal at Burning Man. There’s no social pressure to do any one particular thing at an event like that. But a social group made up of hikers?” So eventually I convinced him—we would see the ponies/horses the next day, I promised, but instead of finding the Meetup people and camping on the beach would get us a hotel room in Ocean City instead… The Seabonnay Hotel turned out to be the place we ended up at, and I left Julian in bed while I locked myself in the bathroom to read the rather-long-to-be-trying-to-read-over-the-course-of-two-weeks-while-also-entertaining-a-guest-from-out-of-town-and-seeing-wild-horses Cloud Atlas, by David Mitchell. Julian thought everyone we encountered in Ocean City seemed remarkably nice. I didn’t notice anything unusual about the residents, but it was good to see my friend appreciating aspects of this somewhat altered plan.   World Education Services Holy crap, I just need to pay you to verify that my U. S. degree is equivalent to a Canadian one so that I can try to register as an OT in the province of Ontario. But I clicked on the wrong thing and now I’ve emailed twice in the course of several days, I’m waiting on hold for the third time, I’ve been told to expect calls back I haven’t gotten, etc. , etc. "

    "body": "24 “Don’t talk to me about loss right now. ” Rosalyn to me on the phone, as I was assuring her that okay, we’ll definitely keep our plan of me going to California to visit her around the end of October/start of November of this year. She said this because she is losing her home: the used trailer she had delivered to her in Orange County, which she intended to live in for the duration of her time in OT school, will need either to be sold or placed into storage, since the RV park she has been living in (the only appropriate place of its kind near her school in Irvine) has given its renters incredibly short notice that (if I recall correctly from what she told me over the phone as I drove my car down the highway) it will not be providing free-standing restrooms any longer. “Don’t talk to me about loss right now. ” Another reason she said this was that her mother is about to give up on continuing to work, because her condition has grown still worse. (I am hoping to visit her tomorrow, although I have not yet found the time to inform her of this fact. ) Rosalyn told me that she needs to look forward to my visit. She phrased this in some way that really struck me. I said, “Wow. That means a lot to me. I’m glad I can be that for you. ” But I… well, to be honest, I forget what she said. I won’t talk to her about loss right now. And today, in fact, is a day when it seems everyone I know—or at least everyone whose updates I see on Facebook—is talking about gains instead of loss, thanks to the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision to declare unconstitutional anything short of full marriage equality for same-sex couples in all fifty states. In fact, I don’t think I have ever seen such a day of celebration in my personal corner of the Internet. The election of Obama in ‘08 was pretty widely celebrated, but not like this. And this is an issue that was strongly opposed by Americans only nine years ago. Many say the various state ballot measures meant to restrict marriage rights back then, in 2004, were the deciding factor in Bush’s re-election: people went out to vote specifically to try to stop same-sex marriages from ever happening in their state. I won’t talk to her about loss right now. But honestly, it’s all I can think about as I wonder about Salma, and her and Eric’s baby, Elena. I even had a dream, last night, in which I found them all, along with various family members, in a doughnut shop. Baby Elena was an infant in the dream, although she was too big to be a realistic one-day-old. She looked more like a one-to-two-month-old. I saw Salma and Eric, in the dream, along with various of their family members whom I didn’t know. The adults were all gathered around a stroller. I marched right up to that stroller so I could look Elena in the eye. And there she was.  That was sixty hours ago. Tonight, I finally texted her again:  And that, even that was four hours ago. …But, Reader? I typed that last sentence, then I immediately flipped windows on my computer to my Facebook feed. There, I read this status update from Janelle:  So much to celebrate today! Last night my goddaughter was born healthy, wide-eyed and breathtaking into a country that will, as of today, legally honor her civil right to marry and build a family with whoever she loves. Welcome Elena, to a place that is more beautiful now than before you arrived. And now I am crying. I just keep crying. I don’t even know when last I cried. Let alone on and on and on like this. "

    "body": "1 A wet Saturday morning—June 27, 2015. I swipe my card at the Metro station. Two minutes until the next train—at least, I think that’s what the overhanging screen, which displays only text in that familiar, digital-alarm-clock style, is saying to me. But no, I realize after a few minutes of sitting. That “two minutes” was in reference to the train going in the opposite direction, the one heading further out into Virginia instead of toward Washington. Another seven minutes until the next one? No, thanks. That would make it all but certain that I would have to take the IELTS on an empty stomach, and without even coffee to activate my thinky parts. So I swipe back out of the station. Walk my way up the long escalator. Only about ten yards to the deli/grocery. I grab a coffee and the first couple of ready-to-eat packaged foods I see that are neither candy nor disgusting. There’s one of those moments, then, when I set down my coffee at an abandoned checkout counter, turn around and walk three steps to grab a bag of kettle chips, then turn back around to see the store clerk and two old ladies who are now in front of me in line. I’ve already called for an Uber (by opening the app on my phone and tapping the words “CALL AN UBER”). The Uber is three minutes away. By the time I pay for my food and cross the street the rideshare driver is waiting there, in the private vehicle he uses to transport people like me, who are in a rush and don’t want to hunt for a taxi. I file in as part of a crowd of test-taskers. I am perhaps the only native English speaker of the bunch. It’s weird, but Canada wants everyone applying for permanent residency to be able to submit a passing score on an English competency exam. After three hours of test-taking, there is a break. All that is left for me is a brief speaking portion. But I have a couple of hours to kill. I’m due for a lunch, anyway. I walk to the nearby Cosi. After finishing a flatbread I think to look up something on my phone. Just before passing out the test booklet, the proctor had said, “I think everyone is here for the Academic test. Is anyone here for the General Training test instead?” I told him I didn’t know. I asked what the General Training test was for. He listed off some examples of situations that test might be for. None of them sounded similar to my purpose, and I wasn’t allowed access to my cell phone at the time so couldn’t research the topic… In any case, I am not that worried about it, for some reason, and I’m genuinely surprised when I find that I have spent three hours taking the wrong test. I go back to the testing center. “I took the wrong test,” I tell the woman who has been letting people in for their spoken section. She looks up my record. It appears that I somehow had actually registered for the wrong test, too. Which isn’t like me. But I’ve been very busy. And a test of my English language fluency is just the sort of thing I’m likely to set the appointment for and then mostly forget about, since I have no real reason to fear failing such a test. So I have to leave and go home and pay another two hundred dollars and plan to sit at the next testing date, a couple of weeks from now. 2 The Megabus ride from D. C. to Philly feels like a vacation in itself. I stare into space most of the time. I Google things on my phone the rest of the time. Further plannings of life. Hostels are their own world, granted, but when the guy at the front desk says “namaste” to me I know that I’m nowhere near Washington anymore. I walk through the crowds along 2nd Street heading south from Market, and though hopping up and down the curb and ducking between the various young folks is second nature to me at this point, it is so, so very different from the crowds I have been ducking through along Clarendon in Arlington. I was dumb for forgetting that this would be the First Friday arts walk—an oversight that led me to book the late-arriving bus I just got off from. But oh, well. I’m the last person to check into the all-male dorm room at the hostel. I use my cell phone as a light source, to see which is the unoccupied bed. I throw my things onto it and step out into the night again. I find a bar that doesn’t seem too packed—somewhere it wouldn’t be stupid for a lone guy with some paper and a pen to wander into at this hour. In fact, just as soon as I am served my first beer, a guy near me at the bar—young, awkward, wearing eyeglasses, the sort who would be cast with little hesitation as the nerd in a bit part for an episode of a situation comedy—lifts his pint glass. I clang it with my own, then look away nervously in that way I am prone to looking away nervously. It seems that my nervousness spoils his mood: he quickly stands up, chugs the beer that was just now full, then taps me on the shoulder and hands me the glass. Shit. Sorry, dude. I didn’t know what I was stepping into there. He moves to make a dramatic exit. He tries for several seconds to figure out why the exit door is not opening for him before it occurs to him that he is pushing on the frame of a plate glass window, not the door. He turns around and makes his way to the real exit. I take the corner table and write. Hopefully he’s okay. 3 I almost get backed into by an automobile that was in park when I started my way across the crosswalk behind it. “Whoa. Shit,” I say, hopping out of its way but never breaking my stride. I’m making my way to the South Street Diner. At the counter, I wait for about a half hour. I continue to write into a small booklet of plain white printer paper that I have cut in half, then folded and stapled to fit easily in my pants pocket. I don’t get spoken to or served. That’s okay. It’s just after the bars have closed, and everything is frantic. I understand. And I really was only looking for a good spot to sit and write, anyway. 4 I have to pee. In hostels I often end up keeping most of my possessions in the bed with me. Tonight I have literally everything I brought to Philadelphia on this top bunk with me, although that is only as much as fit into my leather work/computer bag and a spare tote bag. It’s early. Like, what? Eight? I didn’t get to bed until after three. But bladder gets what bladder wants. Only, where is that slip of paper? I had stuck it in the rear pocket of my black jeans (going along with my black turtleneck, yes, still, after all these years) because it has the door code I will need to get back into the dorm if I leave to use the bathroom. I can’t find the paper. Christ. I guess I’ll be awake now. 5 So, unwashed but knowing that I’ll be able to check in at some point at the hotel where I’ll be spending the next night, I bring my sheets and pillow case to the front desk and check out. It’s a different person at the counter this time—a young woman, also pleasant, although I get no “namaste” from her. Then I’m outdoors. It isn’t hot out yet. I walk past fire engines and floats being set up on the streets for the 4th of July parade, way across Center City, to my and John Hodgman’s favorite diner in Philly, which is sadly expected to close in the near future. While passing through my old neighborhood, I see that the crosswalk right next to my old apartment is painted as a rainbow. I am struck that yet another crosswalk I have used a gazillion times has been painted into the pride colors… but a quick Google on my phone reveals that this seems to be the thing to do now, all a sudden. At the time when I stumbled upon the one in Vancouver, hadn’t I then seen all the ones in North America? Social attitudes about matters this specific can change quickly, though. We were reminded of this when the Supreme Court decision mandating marriage equality in all fifty states was announced last week. (I found out that one while sitting in traffic on I-66 westbound, on my way to a therapy visit. I found that my feelings on the matter were slightly more muted than those of many of my friends. While happy for the people whose unions would be recognized legally, I couldn’t help thinking of something that the years had shown me about culture’s response to positive social change: intolerance abhors a vacuum. So some of this generation’s unfairly maligned have been granted reprieve. It has become okay to live a certain type of gay lifestyle in more places and situations, just as in the late twentieth century it became more okay to present as a certain type of Black American in more areas of life and in more parts of the country. But the abolition of slavery led not to equality of opportunity among the races but rather to Jim Crow laws, economic stratification, and mass incarceration for the descendants of the enslaved. And it was only a couple of months ago that the disgusting response so many white people had to the murder by police officers of Freddie Gray in Baltimore—a complete disinterest then turned into moralizing condemnation once demonstrators damaged property—gave the latest in a series of examples of how horrifically persistent the desire to subjugate entire categories of people can be. These are the final years of the white racial majority in America, when we should be working to assess both the accomplishments and atrocities of how we wielded our great post-World War II power… but instead we’re just acting like assholes, trying to justify this second gilded age in the hope that we, our children, or at least someone who looks like us will be among the billionaires who seem to enjoy it so much. There will always be a freak in the room, someone the general consensus uncritically believes should be whipped into acting in a predetermined way. At least, I have come to believe this to be true. For every child born today who will not be beaten by his peers in twenty years for having a partner of the same sex, there will be one who is beaten for something else. And just as the injustice of assaults against the “homosexual” of twenty years ago were viewed as unfortunate but somewhat the fault of the victim—shouldn’t he have known better than to be so flagrant?—it will take organizing, protests, struggles for representation, and many lives lost before the next subset of people have any of their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness acknowledged by their neighbors. And even that may never happen, given America’s violent character and computer-generated market economy and the historical truth that things just fall apart eventually, and in the course of a lifetime some of what crumbles will be that which you were taking for granted, and this country very well might restructure in a more fundamental way than these musings are assuming. ) The official unveiling of the crosswalk is planned for tomorrow, my phone tells me. I walk to the Shops at Market East, planning to go to K-Mart and inspect the collection of tablet computers I imagine I will find there. But instead I find that K-Mart is gone and replaced with Century 21, a department store I have never heard of and which appears only to carry things that I consider to be a waste of time, like jewelry and designer hand bags. Back outside, the sky is raining slightly. The parade has started. I walk along the parade route, which speeds up the process of seeing it all and helps me enjoy it. (I don’t usually like parades; I get bored. ) I sit at a Starbucks and catch up on work documentation. I go to see Inside Out at a theatre full of like seventy adults and four children. I guess kids have finally learned that if they wait until Pixar movies come out on Redbox, they won’t have to watch their parents cry in public. Then to the Society Hill Hotel, where I am given the same room I was given four years ago. The window is still cracked, but it has been fixed up with duct tape. And it’s summer this time, so there’s an air conditioning unit. I like small spaces. I just wish this one provided me with soap. 6 After a nap I catch a bus to Target. Still thinking about tablet computers. In the parking lot I am surrounded by 360 degrees of fireworks coming from both near and far. I have only ever liked Independence Day in this city. The guy at Target tells me I should come back the next day, hinting that I’ll get a better deal then if I decide to go for an iPad like those I’ve been talking about. The city bus I take back from South Philly gets stuck in post-fireworks traffic. Once I manage to get off and walk I sit down to eat at Jon’s on South Street. I’m led to a seat outside, although I was not asked whether outdoors would be my preference. I’m slightly disappointed at first—I thought I wanted to escape the humidity—but it proves to be nice. The crowds are big and mostly happy. South Street is pretty great. 7 My last scheduled therapy visit of the day is canceled—it was someone who just stopped answering phone calls one day—and having woken up early and then eaten a lot of dairy in the course of the day, I’m ready to take a nap. I fall onto the mattress in my alcove-bedroom and give Rosalyn a call. “How are you?” I ask. “Stressed about Mom,” she says. “Yeah. I got your email. ” I want to give her the opportunity to talk. She doesn’t say much, though. She does say that Chris has offered to pay for a flight to see her mom again. Just as she starts to talk about what that might look like, though, she tells me, “My sister is calling. I’ve got to go. ” Ending the call with an urgency that would be unlike her under different circumstances. 8 It’s only Rosalyn and me there tonight at her now-deceased mother’s house. Champion, the dog, still looking for his owner to return from a vacation, expecting her to be the next person who walks through the door. He remembers me, of course, from the months when I was living there, while I was doing my fieldwork for OT school in Bethesda. But I’m no Mommy. The long carpet in the upstairs highway—the most common spot for Champion to pee and poop on—has already been pulled up. Houses in this neighborhood are worth quite a lot, but this one could use a lot of cleaning and repair before it goes on the market. All that legal and financial stuff will be a pain. “All the paperwork has been carefully scattered at random throughout the house,” Rosalyn says. It sounds like her uncle will be handling a lot of it, and so will her sister. Rosalyn sits with me at the kitchen table. She cries, just beginning to process. Back in California she had been focused on the schoolwork that needed to be done. She had to not feel things through. I spend the night there with her and wake up to my alarm clock. She is still asleep after I have showered and dressed. I let her know that I’m going. I hug her goodbye. I walk out past her sister, who has arrived for a day of going through things in the house and planning the memorial events of the days to come. "

    "title": "XXIII. The Inevitable Burn (70-88)",
    "body": "70 I get the key to my room at the Broadway Hostel. I open the door and the light is on. There are several pieces of luggage that look like they were pulled into the room and never opened, and there is a woman sleeping on top of the covers on the bottom bunk of the single bunk bed. In my experience, hostel dorms have always been single-sex only for single males who make bookings, so when the woman stirs I ask, “Is this your room?” “No,” she says, so I leave and report this to the person at the front desk… …who smirks at me and says, “It’s mixed-sex. ” “Oh, I didn’t know that. She said it wasn’t her room, though. ” “Well, if she has any questions, she can come down here. A mixed-sex dorm is what you booked. ” “Okay. It doesn’t matter to me. I just didn’t know I could do that. ” I start walking to the elevator, but she calls me back. “On second thought,” she says, “I’ll give you a different room to make sure there are no issues. And it’ll just be you. I won’t put anyone else in there. ” “Okay. Thank you,” I say. I don’t understand why she’s doing this, but I’m happy she is. I sleep, then, probably better than I would have done otherwise. I wake up to the sounds of a loud bunch of people from nearby rooms leaving all together at the same time. I sigh, get up out of bed, and sit in the middle of the floor. I stare at the wall for a while. 71 After my two classes of the day I go to the student center to do some stuff at the computer lab. I figure out how to print things, and I enjoy the feeling of just hanging out and doing work legitimately on the campus of such a respected institution as Columbia. I send a digital copy of my completed thesis for the other respected institution at which I am a graduate student. I print out an application form for an assessment of my OT credentials for the process of applying for an Australian permanent resident visa. I print out what I need to send to the state of Pennsylvania to get them to finalize my license. New York state’s licensing board I still haven’t heard anything from. Then I go to the Sidewalk Café, where again I think I’m confusing the host by just hanging out although I’m not signed up to play. Then sitting at an all-night diner, text-chatting on my phone with Rosalyn. It’s kind of chilly, but I have a coat, so I walk all the way from the Lower East Side to Times Square in the middle of the night, amazed that New York has become so comfortable, so safe-feeling, so overall wonderful. Again I think to myself that the people who hate Times Square must not be going there at three in the morning, when it makes day out of night for just you and a couple of tourists and a couple of cops and a couple of people with hoses pressure washing the sidewalk. “Entrance closed, use entrance on 8th Avenue,” says a sign at Port Authority on 42nd Street. “Entrance closed, use entrance on 42nd Street,” says a sign on 8th Avenue. I try a door at the 42nd Street entrance, and it opens. “Ticket needed to enter,” reads a sign. “Greyhound ticket booth?” I ask. “Yeah. It’s inside. Go ahead,” he says. 72 I went from being shocked at how powerless I could feel in this world to being shocked at how privileged a life I found myself in. Now I want to see what I can do for other people. This is how I know I’m doing well. Anyone who doesn’t want to give hasn’t really received yet. 73 I’m picked up by Bruce at the Springfield bus stop. “Where have you been? New York?” “Yeah,” I say. 74 I still haven’t returned to feeling one hundred percent well.  My sleep times are a surprise each day. On Thanksgiving morning, after I have been awake all night, my mother says, “You probably won’t be coming today, then, right?” It actually wouldn’t have been a problem for me to attend Thanksgiving, and I think she knows this. I take this as a weakly expressed preference for me not to attend. I have to get used to and come to terms with the fact that I don’t really belong to this family anymore. 75 After class in New York on Monday—(I drive this time, taking advantage again of the relatively inexpensive lot I’ve been using)—I stay at the Hostelling International. These really do tend to be good hostels, usually better than the independent hostels I’ve stayed at. I fall asleep early, wake up basically in the middle of the night, and drive south. 76 So that then I’m in Philadelphia early in the morning. I go to the 24 hour FedEx Office on Market Street (at the fancy hotel there) to print out the paperwork to apply for the credential assessment that I would need to apply for a permanent resident visa for Australia. Then I walk back through my old neighborhood—down 13th Street, to the now-rainbow crosswalk, and a right onto Locust, and a left onto Broad Street, and down a few blocks to the Starbucks. It’s rainy, so I pinch closed the top of my leather computer bag. (It has a zippered part, but then also parts that don’t zip… not worth explaining here. ) I get a window seat, pull out my monthly planner and my phone, make sure I have all my transportation and housing accounted for through the end of the semester. 77 Then to Baltimore. I’ve pre-paid for the parking. I’m staying again at a Hostelling International. I nap for an hour in an empty dorm room, on a bottom bunk, before taking the city bus to JHU. For the second to last of the class sessions for the thesis course, four alumni of the program are there to talk about their experiences as writers and to answer questions. I am thirty-four years old. Back at the hostel, I sit in the common area for a while. I chat with Rosalyn. I work on the Life Story. I plan my calendar. I sleep. I wake up at 4:45 in the morning to the unambiguous sounds of two men pleasing each other sexually in the shower. This goes on for some time. I realize that I am not going to get back to sleep this morning. After the two have finally gone back to bed and I have waited an additional ten minutes or so I get my things together, carry my two bags down to the front desk, and check out. I drive to New York. Narrative Medicine students are strongly encouraged to attend the monthly “Narrative Medicine Rounds” lectures, so I have worked this into my schedule. I want to be participating more than is necessary in things related to this Master’s program. I want to be going to as many non-required events as I can and so on. But I think I only see maybe one or two other students, no faculty I recognize. The speaker this time is Rick Guidotti, a former fashion photographer who now photographs people with conditions in ways that show their beauty and personality. Then I drive to Massachusetts. 78 The next day, I go to Salma’s. Eric is still at work. I haven’t actually seen most of her and Eric’s place yet; she gives me the tour. And a trip to the Holyoke Mall. Hanging with kids is really not that bad. Not that I ever really thought it was bad. I’ve always liked kids. But I didn’t always feel that I had earned the right to be around them, being that I was different, that my identity was shade-grown. But now that the world is increasingly seeing me as something other than a man who fell to Earth, I am no longer expecting someone to grab my arm and tell me that a book-reading, art-appreciating freak like myself cannot be hanging out around children. Salma is breastfeeding all over the place. I think the first time I ever had anyone breastfeed in my presence was Alice, in the year 2007, when I wanted to leave Massachusetts and so crashed on that couch there in Morton, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Whereas when I was a child it was assumed that technology had created in the invention of baby formula something better than a mother’s milk, the years since have in America made common sense of the opposite conclusion, that the natural way to feed a baby is better. A push for acceptance of this happening in public followed. To be honest, it made me a little uncomfortable when Alice was doing it back then, but it feels a lot more normal to me now. Salma and I eat, too, downstairs in the food court. We get a coffee. In the course of our time together we discuss her experience in the Master’s of Social Work program at Boston College, her relationship with Eric, and her family. Then, somehow, it’s nightfall, and then the morning, and then, before I know it, I am in New York City again. 79 I don’t think I’ve ever parked on-street in Manhattan before, but I do today—in front of the Columbia School of Social Work, where I’m going for the orientation for a project that I only heard about two days ago when an email was sent out to all the students in the Narrative Medicine program mentioning a need for volunteers and a deadline of that same day. The program is working with teenagers in jail on Rikers Island to code an automated Twitter account and write the tweets that will be sent out at regular intervals. The orientation is quick—only an hour long. There are two young faculty, one first-year social work student, and someone else phoning in. Then I’m back in my vehicle and driving through Manhattan. It’s incredible how the stopping and going and the swerving and the decision-making that driving a car in Manhattan demands of a person does not particularly stress me out. I find it kind of fun, in fact, with my only real annoyance being the time it takes out of my day. 80 I sleep. I wake up at around five in the morning. I shower. I check out of my hostel in New Jersey. I drive to the parking lot I’ve arranged to park in. I walk to the same building where the previous night’s orientation was and I sit on the steps in front of it, eating my breakfast (from Dunkin’ Donuts) and drinking my coffee (from Starbucks). People eventually come by. We end up running late because of problems relating to the Zipcar van, but eventually we’re on our way. Then we’re in the parking lot at the start of the road that leads to the bridge that leads to the island that is the largest penal colony in the world. 81 As we wait in the classroom at Riker’s for the teenagers we’re going to be working with, I notice on the floor a single book that has fallen, unnoticed, behind some desks. In a room otherwise empty of literature, it is a book of poetry. “Oh, cool,” I say. “I actually took a class with the editor of this once. ” By this I mean Martín Espada. No one is listening to me, though. I flip through the book and find a folded-up sheet of lined paper with four lines of verse on it. Presumably, these were written by one of the young men in jail here. I am not in the mood to try stealing anything, even teenage poetry, from the New York Department of Corrections, but I memorize the poem so that I can write it down after I leave: This is a shout out to life The loved ones on the outside living Catch me on the way up Heard ya got ya bread up&lt;/i&gt; Sometimes, you can literally find poetry in the places you are least expecting it. 82 The Super 8 Motel in Long Island City, Queens is all that I hoped—meaning, it has parking and a place for me to nap. Unfortunately, I don’t wake up in time for the “Master of Narrative Medicine Holiday Salon”. This is a real disappointment to me. I’ve been wanting to try to be more social with my Narrative Medicine people, and I RSVP’d in the affirmative. I explore a little bit of the area around the motel. A Starbucks for coffee. A place where I buy some beer that I place in the mini-fridge and then drink while writing OKCupid messages to people on my iPad, lying in bed with the covers pulled up. I go to see Fun Home. I feel like the guy sitting next to me during the play keeps moving his leg so that it touches mine, no matter what I do. I enjoy this and never look at him. I wake up super early. Drive to Darien, Connecticut and park the car. Take the MetroNorth to the 125th Street/Harlem stop. I wait for the bus that the Google Maps app on my iPhone tells me to take. I pull out my MetroCard. “The MetroCard won’t work here,” says the bus driver, pointing at the cardboard that is taped over the card reader. Clearly the driver expects me to just take a seat, so I do. I take a mental note to look into this, see what buses usually do if the reader breaks. I’m surprised they’re just letting people ride for free instead of immediately sending in a different bus. Close to where I’m planning to get off the bus to go to class, transit officers board the bus and check to make sure that everyone has the ticket they were supposed to have purchased from a special machine before boarding the bus. “Come with me,” says one of the officers when I say that I don’t know what he’s talking about, that all I know is I was waved on when I tried to pay with a MetroCard. He leads me off the bus. He hands me a slip of paper and tells me to call the number on it. He says they’ll check and make sure that I have money on the MetroCard and that should take care of things. Then the next bus is coming and he tells me I can get on it. I’m a few minutes late for class. And when I check the slip of paper he gave me, it’s a $100 ticket. And when I call the number on the back an annoyed woman tells me she can’t do anything, that I either will need to pay the fine or else have a hearing for the ticket. Another night at the Super 8. In the morning, I type and print out a written explanation of what happened with the bus and send it by post to Brooklyn, as a “hearing by mail”. Although, I still expect to have to pay a hundred dollars, because human beings are terrible. I take a Megabus to Baltimore for my last thesis class before the thesis reading. I hang out at the Johns Hopkins library until it’s time to take an Uber to the train station to catch my 4 AM train. I sleep for most of the train ride. I get off in Danbury, Connecticut. I take the MetroNorth to Darien, where my car is parked. The guy in the lot is confused and gives me a hard time at first, thinking I didn’t pay, when I actually paid in advance for two days of parking. Then I drive back up to Massachusetts. 83 I drive to New Hampshire, because in the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts a notary public is not able to do what I need to do to get my credentials as an OT assessed in order to apply for a permanent resident visa for Australia. Then I meet with Allison, upstairs at the High Horse in Amherst, Massachusetts, where it takes us forever to get services and where she needs to leave after one drink anyway because her mom is waiting for her. Then I get dropped off by Bruce again, at the Springfield bus station. I take a Greyhound to New York and walk to the Megabus stop. (The new subway station at Hudson Yards has now opened, so, that’s nice. ) The Megabus hits traffic from a bad highway accident near Baltimore. I get to the White Marsh Park and Ride about 90 minutes late. I text the program director to say that I’m on my way and that I will be there before the thesis reading starts. Everyone reads. I have another Master’s degree. Then I go to the goth night that exists there in Baltimore. Like every other goth night that still exists in America, only about a dozen people go there. I’m tired. I’m like, whatever. I don’t want to wait for a 4 AM bus. I decide to stay the night at the same hostel I stayed at in this town previously. The next day is another one spent in transit as I get myself from Maryland to Massachusetts. Then I spend a day doing schoolwork. Then I drive my mother’s car to New York (because my registration has expired and I don’t want to have to bother to renew it in Massachusetts before I move out of state at the start of the new year). It’s my last day of classes for the semester at Columbia. I only have final papers left to do. I play at the Sidewalk Café for the first time. I play the songs “Thank You for Not Murdering Me” and “Hey, Everybody!” (I was planning to wear my rainbow tie-dyed skirt while doing this, but as I was downstairs tuning up someone sat in the seat I had been in, and the skirt was under that seat, and I didn’t want to go through the process of bothering them. ) I love the Sidewalk. I drive back to Massachusetts. I spend the next couple of days working on the final paper for my Accounts of Self class. 84 Bruce drives me to the bus station. I don’t really have a good excuse to proffer regarding exactly why I’m spending three days in New York. It’s getting stupid, I know. But it’s practically time to move there already, so. 85 After a nap I go to East Williamsburg and meet my first ever New York Internet date. Zelig is delightful; he and I sit at the bar at a place called Duckduck, where Masters of Karaoke is having a night. He is twenty-five years old, an introverted bisexual polyamorous asexual sadist with a clerical job who writes horror erotica and sings a great Freddie Mercury. We ask each other questions. I get him talking about fairly personal things, true to form. I ask him what his advice is for someone who is just moving to New York. “Don’t try to do everything,” he suggests. “Please?” I say. “But I really want to do everything. ” He and I (but mostly he) get the night going effectively through our renditions of old rock songs and are as a result handed a couple of tequila shots on the house. I am wearing my black jacket with a black tee shirt and black pants, no glasses. I feel like this is a good look. While Zelig is in the restroom, an attractive woman throws her arm around my shoulder and the shoulder of the also attractive woman sitting next to me. I lean forward so as not to be complicit in this. Maybe she thinks I’m someone else? No. She is just knowingly hugging me as well as the second woman, simply because I’m there. Over the course of the night, then, the second woman—the one sitting next to me—spends quite a lot of time leaning against me, effectively using me as a chairback while she for example lifts one leg in the air and gives a dude she is interacting with a show of what is under her short skirt. “Is this what bars in Brooklyn are always like?” I ask Zelig at one point as I am pushed into him by the woman, for whose sexy public playtime I have become a prop. “It depends where in Brooklyn. ” “Well, Is Williamburg always like this?” “Yes. ” We walk for a bit to the subway, continuing to talk. Then, to prolong our conversation, we walk to the next subway stop. Take the train. Part ways where we each have to get on a different train. A hug, then I ride back to my hostel. 86 The next day, I write a lot. I write in notebooks. I sit around at the hostel, which has cozy common areas to hang out in. I go to the Village, to Le Poisson Rouge, for a 15th anniversary tribute show for the PJ Harvey album Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea. I walk. I consider doing something else in the neighborhood. There are a couple of comedy shows I would enjoy… but nah. I get dinner at an Asian restaurant. 87 Dec. 18, 2015. New York, New York. Why did I wear this? Black blazer, black tee shirt, black pants. Is this my new all-black costume? It felt like it was working last night. I have read and re-read everything contained in this Life Story, so I know that things flow more smoothly when I keep the tense consistent and relate my life in the fashion of a storyteller. I know. I know I sometimes make things more difficult for you. I’m just making it more likely that you will not be convinced to come here and find me. But… I’m beginning to get cocky about my relationship with you. I’m not as insecure as I used to be. I believe that you’re going to help me, so long as I continue to be myself. 88 The guy in the bunk above me at the hostel wakes up at four in the morning. He goes through his stuff (which is all scattered in the small amount of space between our bed and the wall) for an absurd length of time. The guy then goes out into the hallway and starts loudly talking in a language other than English to what sound like they must be buddies of his. I decide to get my bag out of the locker that is next to the bed. The guy has been rifling through stuff right next to where I have left (but not brought a lock to secure) valuables including a laptop and iPad. I already left my iPad at a diner here in Manhattan last week (and then got it back); I don’t feel like having it stolen from me now. As I do this, a different guy gets out of the bed across the aisle from me and begins his day, waving around an obnoxiously bright flashlight in the process. (I mentioned the part about it being four in the morning, right?) I fall back asleep. I wake up to the 6:15 alarm that I set. I go back to sleep. It’s seven something. I should have woken up by now to go to this RikersBot thing. But the project’s not all I hoped for, anyway. The people stopped talking to me about halfway through the first day. I’m pretty sure it was the young people in jail I got along with best on that day I was there. No one responded to me when I emailed to say that I couldn’t make it to the second session. And it’s not because missing a day was so bad: I was one of three people who were unable to attend that day, and the evening session that was supposed to happen “sometime this week” was never coordinated. So, I send a text message to the guy who I guess is leading the thing. (He was extremely late the first day and, according to emails I was cc’d on, the second day as well. ) No response to my text message. I later find out that they don’t get to have the session, anyway, because the unit that students came from during the previous two sessions is in lockdown and no other young people can be found who want to participate. I sleep until I have to wake up to shower and check out. I take a bus to the 125th Street-Harlem station (locating the machine I need to use to pay for the special ticket this time), then MetroNorth to New Haven. I walk to the downtown. I eat at Chipotle, then I get a coffee and quietly sit near the windows at Elm City Community Market, a healthy-expensive supermarket, which is also notably quiet. Then I take a late-arriving bus to Springfield. Bruce is waiting in his vehicle to pick me up there. "

    "body": "89 Bizarrely, I realize on Sunday, it is now the week of Christmas. The weather all up and down the east coast has been unseasonably warm, often ridiculously so. I tried the last time I was in New Hampshire to get copies notarized of whatever I would need for an Australian visa… but I forgot one thing, the results of my English language testing. So, I drive up to Keene again. I go to the other TD Bank in town, not the same one I went to, because I would feel bad and embarrassed if I bothered the other guy again to take care of this. It’s no problem. That gets taken care of, and I go to Main Street to grab some lunch. A new message comes in from someone who has “liked” my profile and whom I have “liked” in return. While waiting for a crosswalk there in Keene I start typing a response. As I sit at a Mexican restaurant and wait for enchiladas, then, I continue to type out messages on my phone. This is someone who sends short, quick messages one after another, using the site like a chat service. While I do manage to write a few more lines of the short story I am writing for my last final of the semester, I spend most of my time in the restaurant reading and responding to these messages. The same thing happens after I have driven over to Brattleboro and made myself cozy at that bagel place there. When I mention where I am as I type, she tells me that she went to New Hampshire for college—Dartmouth. I have her remind me what town that’s in. The sun goes down and I head south. I go down into the basement at my mother’s place and get a bit of writing done. Still, the bulk of that story gets written on Monday, and I don’t finish the required explanation of its relevance to a philosopher (in my case, Emmanuel Levinas) until 11:30 in the morning on Tuesday. 90 I pack up the things that I am moving to New York City into the Volkswagen. This is a more time-consuming process than I was hoping and expecting, and I don’t get one hundred percent of the stuff I was hoping to bring into the car. (I have doubts that it would all fit inside my storage locker, anyway. ) But by 3:45 in the afternoon or something like that I have managed to leave. My trip is slowed by four different collision scenes that I encounter along the way. At the storage place I tap my card against a reader. I load up a pushcart. Then tap the card at the entrance to the building. Then tap it to get through another inside door. First pushing the pushcart for a bit, then pulling the pushcart. Down long aisles. I know by now to make a turn left, to make a turn right, and then to look for the sign that points the way to elevator number three. A right, down another aisle to the elevator. I push a button to get into the elevator. I pull the pushcart into the elevator. I scan my card once again, so that the elevator will take me to the appropriate floor. Then I push the pushcart. A left. A right. I find one of the rolling stepladder, set it up in the row where I need it. I use one key to open one lock. I use another key to open another lock. I open the door. Then I need to descend the stairs, push the stairs a little bit forward so that they are right in front of the newly-opened locker. And I move in my stuff. And the time has crept forward, but that’s okay. I’ll just not be as early as expected to the show I am planning to go to, the show at St. Vitus Bar, the metal/industrial bar in Greenpoint, where I am meeting that Dartmouth alum with whom I have been texting. Checking my “likes” and messages. A guy seems bright, certainly well-educated, but just sends me a one-liner, “Hey, how are you!” as a message. Which, I don’t know why so many men make this mistake. I am not going to bother with that. On my phone in the parking lot for the storage place I investigate where to park and realize that the best option is just to park on-street in Brooklyn. First, I must drive across Manhattan. Whee! Then I am inside the bar, but it appears there is no show going on. The scene is quiet—just, like, three or four patrons and the bartender. My date is on her way. I drink half of my first beer and scroll through my Facebook feed while waiting for her. Then she arrives. I am, she has told me, listed in her phone as Mystery Man. She is listed in mine as Mystery Woman. This is because I realized during our exchange of messages that she was asking me for my phone number before either of us had asked for the other’s name. So I joked that while she was welcome to have my number, I did not give out my name until the third date. She said great, that that was sort of hot. So, I am meeting up for a date with a woman whose name I do not know. A young woman: she is twenty-five years old. (As was Zelig, my last date, coincidentally. ) A graphic designer, with pink streaks in bangs hanging to either side of her face. She voices disappointment that she has opted to wear black lipstick for the first time in many years when there is pretty much no one here. (I have taken a table in the corner of this bar, which has a large, lit-up, upside-down cross near it. ) When she goes to get her drink, she asks about the show (which was a line-up of metal bands) and is told that it was canceled due to a death in the family of one of the band members. I don’t mean to, and I’m sure she doesn’t mean to, but we end up talking mostly about her work until the long-haired male bartender (dressed in black, just as Mystery Woman and I are) tells us they are about to close early (at midnight) and that if we want anything else we should let him know. Mystery just graduated this past year. She ended up being a non-traditional student, like I was. Since then she moved to New York, where her much older sister—much older, meaning one year older than me—already lived. Now she lives with roommates on the Upper West side. She and I step outside into a foggy night. There were some other bars down the street, she says. We step into one—a pretty normal-looking Brooklyn bar, hardwood décor. Not empty, not packed. Not looking like it’s about to close or anything. We get a table sort of cut off from the main bar. She’s talking about a guy who has been on her mind. He was interested in her before, but at the time she had a girlfriend, and now he has another girlfriend but at this party the girl was flirty with her, and then the two of them were inviting her over, but it turned out that the girlfriend wasn’t actually interested in her, that instead her thing was that she liked to watch, so she wanted to watch the guy with another girl. And they didn’t actually hook up there with the girlfriend present, but they went pretty far, and even if the guy and the girlfriend broke up, Mystery knows it would be a mistake. I ask her where she’s at with all this dating stuff: is she experimenting to try to find out what sort of relationship she ultimately wants, or is she dating in the hopes of finding something serious, or is she taking some time to enjoy some just-for-now flings and involvements and whatnot while she is young and before she settles down? “That last one,” she answers. She likes New York but expects that like many people, she will move out when it’s time to start having kids. After sitting for a bit in this second bar, it’s getting late and more drinking would not be prudent—I need to drive, after all. We both get into the car. She puts her address into the GPS. I drive to Manhattan. Idling in what is not actually a parking spot (but knowing that it does not really matter, as this is just a residential street off Central Park on the Upper West Side in the middle of the night) we continue to talk. She has mentioned the roommate situation prior to the one she has now—that she tried to make the best of it, but that, among other things, one of the roommates was a pot smoker—and that plus one other, similar comment leads me to ask, “So, you don’t smoke pot, huh?” At which point she tells me about how pot smoking specifically became a problem in her life during her college years—that she dropped out because of it and went through rehab before getting re-admitted and finishing her degree. “But I managed it,” she says, “Just as my brother did. ” “Managed what?” “A degree from one of the Ivies. ” I ask her if we should find a diner nearby, to continue our conversation over coffee and food. “I’d be up for going somewhere, but there aren’t really any all night diners around here,” she tells me. “Really? Well, why don’t you just look up how far it would be to get the closest one, since we’re in a car. ” She finds one about a mile away. We luck out and see someone in front of us pull out from their curb spot just as we have reached the block we are looking for. We stay at the diner pretty much forever. At some point I realize she has wiped off the black lipstick, so that now there are just lips. It comes up in the natural course of the discussion that I ask (although I have been known to ask this even without a good excuse) what I seem like to her, what kind of a date I am. She tells me that I am “so, so relaxed”, which is what everyone tells me who does not think I am a hopeless mess of nerves and anxiety. She asks me the same thing. I say, “You know, this happens to me all the time. I ask these sorts of questions, but then I’m not prepared with an answer when they’re thrown back at me. You seem like…” I make a thinking face. I stammer and say a few things that don’t really make sense, but then finally I hit my stride and begin to be articulate. “You seem like someone who has learned a lot through your experiences. With some people, if they haven’t ever really found themselves drifting in life, it’s hard for them to, like, decide on and stick to a course of action. But you seem like you’re someone who, even if you’re pulled in this direction or that by feelings or impulses or whatever, you know how to see that fact and hold it in perspective and keep yourself on course. You seem like someone who is actively and effectively working on herself. ” “That’s… really validating of where I want to think of myself as being right now,” she says, alone in a diner at five in the morning with a thirty-four-year-old mystery man wearing a black jacket over a black tee shirt, with closely-shaven facial hair, who has taken his glasses off again after realizing (having worn them for driving) that he forgot to take them off before stepping inside under the bright, artificial light. After more time has passed, she explains that her brain is shutting down. We stare at each other. She sets it up as a staring contest, but actually, we each keep looking away or blinking without the other bothering to claim victory. So, a series of staring contests, but without the contests. Back in her car. “You’ll know we’re back near my place when you see Central Park. ” “Oh,” I say. “That’s right. I forgot. That little patch of grass. I’ll try to keep an eye open for it. ” Parked across from her place, she looks at the clock. It’s 5:53 AM. “I’ll go inside at 6:00,” she says. We resume staring. Moreso than when we were inside and had a table between our bodies, I am finding myself losing my cool, smiling and looking away. “What?” she says to me at one point after I do this. “Your face is provocative,” I say. “Evocative?” she asks, mishearing me. She sounds skeptical, and I’m not sure why. “Is that the best word for it?” “No,” I answer quietly. “It isn’t. ” Another silence. I say, “You’re beautiful. ” She immediately looks down in a blushing smile—a sort of smile that I’m not sure I’ve made anyone smile before. One sees it in movies a lot, usually on the face of a woman wearing a dress. It is a smile of relief, a little bit of accomplishment, and surprise at the directness of a compliment one is happy to receive. I go on. “Your face and eyes are complex. It’s like they’re saying a lot of different things at once to me, and so I end up reacting to that, shifting between nervous fidgeting and goofy grinning and… just… staring ahead. ” “Thank you,” she says. “Thank you. ” I continue to stare at her. She continues to stare at me. She asks, “How long do you want to just keep staring at me?” I try to respond, but my words are stupid and incoherent again. “I don’t know. How about you? How long do you want to keep staring?” I eventually conclude. She won’t let that slide. “Did you just say, ‘I don’t know’? That was your answer?” “Sorry. ” “Because… I know I’d be interested in some other things. And maybe you haven’t noticed, or maybe you have noticed my not-always-subtle shuffling forward in your direction. At first I was sitting all the way back there. Now I’m here	. ” I try to buy myself another moment’s hesitation. “How close do you want to get?” I ask. “I can move even closer. ” I take off my glasses. “Oh? You don’t want to see me anymore, now that I’m right up next to you?” “I have two questions for you,” I say. I leave a moment’s pause. “May I kiss you?” “Yes,” she quickly answers. “And should I kiss you?” She kisses me. It is soft. It is true. I leave Mystery at her home and drive away into the sunrise. I only see one collision this time. That’s an improvement. 91 Mystery replies kindly to my texts, even complimenting my kissing, but shows nothing like the persistent interest she expressed before our meeting. I don’t see her again. 92 I spend a day of driving around the Pioneer Valley, sitting in coffee shops, typing up things that I have written for the Life Story within the past few months. 93 Then another day—this one known as Christmas Eve. Part of the day goes similarly to the previous day. Then it is time for me to meet up with Allison, as she and I have discussed over text. Working out the details with her on my way out of the Hadley Starbucks, and while stopped at the gas station in Sunderland, I am also at the same time exchanging messages on OKCupid with a comedy writer in town from Los Angeles for a few months. When it is time for me to turn my phone off to go hang out with Allison, I let him know that I am doing this, and I request that he send me another message that I can reply to later. He does not. In Greenfield I arrive at Allison’s place, where she lives alone. She immediately offers me a glass of rosé—she already has one poured for herself that she has been drinking from. We sit, drink the wine, and try to figure out where we’re going to buy food. I end up driving to a liquor store to grab another bottle of rosé, then to Athens Pizza to get a pizza. At her place, drinking, she and I both talk about ourselves, maybe even more than we ever have before. I read aloud to her the profiles of people on OKCupid who have “liked” me since the last time I checked, and then I say, “No, I won’t like her back; yes, I’ll like him back. ” Meanwhile she’s preparing a mousse in a graham cracker crust to share with people on Christmas. “Wait,” she says, after she has finished making the mousse and placed it in the oven. “This isn’t supposed to be baked at all. But the recipe called for raw egg! Maybe it’ll be better if I do put it in the oven, though. ” Just imagine the little kitchen in this tiny little apartment, which is like half of the ground level of what would in any case not be a large house. (Before we left to get the pizza and the additional wine, my comment to her: “I keep staring, because I can’t tell if what I’m looking at on the floor by the door is an altar or a shoe rock. ”) (Her: “It’s both! It actually is both. ”) (And I have asked her: “Why don’t you write a book and shop it around?” because I thought her ideas that led to the Medea zine sounded really promising, and the zine itself was really well written. ) I recommend that she not bake the mousse. She lets me know the next day that “people fucking loved that pie”. 94 I go to an Indian restaurant in Easthampton, Massachusetts and find Salma, Janelle, and Janelle’s sister, Danielle (who impressively remembers me), finished with their meal. I knew I was running late and made sure to eat before arriving. We all go to Janelle’s place. Janelle fixes up for me some hot wine, followed by some sort of a cinnamon whiskey on the rocks. Salma isn’t really drinking these days because she’s breastfeeding, but the rest of us drink. Tiff stops by and joins in for a while. The whole scene is great—it’s an instance of something I haven’t experienced in a small group setting lately, which is girl time. It’s always such a pleasure when I realize I’ve been accepted into a social experience that is (aside from myself) made up of all women and which involves that open, unpretentious sort of discussion of the human condition that men often learn to derail at all costs. Baby Elena, although she is only six months old, is crawling. I find that I can get her to do this quite easily and reliably by getting down on the floor and illustrating what I want her to do. She is even able to stop, turn around, then crawl in another direction on command. It’s pretty remarkable. I’ve always liked Janelle, and it’s great to spend some time around her again. I’m getting along really well with Danielle, too. And the two of them seem to have a really communicative sort of relationship that I don’t always see in siblings. Janelle has just helped Danielle design an online dating profile, using match. com (although Janelle herself is on OKCupid, where she recently met the guy she has started dating). I ask her to read what has been written, and she obliges. I give input—which remarkably seems not to come out as foolish. “Shhhh! Shhhh! Shhhh!” repeats Salma to Elena to try to soothe her to sleep. Everyone quiets. The lights have been turned down. “I don’t think I realized before Elena how fun babies can be,” I say. “Babies can be really fun,” says Janelle. “A lot of work, and really tiring, but really fun, too. ” Fuck. Do I want a child? Danielle, referring to the state of American politics and the shift towards fascism evident in the rhetoric of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, says something like, “I’m starting to think, should I be seriously working on getting out of the country?” To which I say that I am doing just that. In a room full of people who have lived overseas, everyone understands without explanation why I have given up on our country. They seem to listen carefully as I tell them about the process of pursuing permanent residency in Canada and how it differs from the process of doing the same in Australia. Hugs all around as Salma carries Elena out and I leave behind her. Into a December that is finally getting cold. But it’s also beautiful. 95 It snows. The first Massachusetts snow of the season. The first I have seen this season outside of Alaska. I am moving to New York City in two days. I have lately been teary-eyed while reading Ms. Marvel comic books, teary-eyed while watching the new Star Wars movie, teary-eyed while in a bed in my mother’s house and drifting in and out of consciousness and dreaming slash thinking about the cultural changes that have been making more possible the claiming of queer identities that would in previous years have been quite isolating, and dangerous, and in many cases deadly. I have been teary-eyed thinking about how safe New York City feels. When I thought I knew cities. When I thought, between the unearned privileges afforded to a white person such as myself and the perspective I had from having lived in locations all across America, I was not the sort of person who wanted for a safe space. I was expecting only a difference of scale in the urbanness of New York. What will this mean? I have been teary-eyed, because I don’t know, but I’m starting to believe this is how I want my life to be. "

    "title": "XXIII. The Inevitable Burn (9-18)",
    "body": "9 I have a long list of therapy visits I have to make sure people get before I leave the area. The clinicians doing the start of care (meaning that they are supposed to be the first ones seeing particular patients) have in a few cases not been able to make contact yet. This could be good, bad, or unimportant to the patients—I don’t know yet, because I haven’t met them—but it’s good for me, since it means I work an average instead of an extremely long day, with the understanding that these patients would have needed to be scheduled for the following Medicare week anyway, even if I hadn’t been arranging my time in such a way as to pull off a six-day trip to Massachusetts. After an early evening nap I get a call from Rosalyn, who invites me over again. I drive up and then spend some time sitting with her at the kitchen table while she puts together an art project in her mother’s memory. Friday, I understand, will be the ceremony for immediate family. This is the way her mother wanted things to be—family only. On Saturday there will be a celebration of her life over dinner, to include anyone who wants to come and is available. The art project, made from various types of paper, will be a design of a tree, for which everyone who participates will create a “leaf” to mark with their name, finger print, and if desired a personal message. To break up the task and to give Rosalyn a change of scenery, I also drive us to the local 7-11. There we pick up various foods one generally does not eat in the middle of the night unless one is either young and adventurous or spiraling downward into self-destruction. (But in my case, I’m just weird. ) Then I drive back toward Arlington to gather my things, hop onto the Metro, walk through Union Station, and board the Amtrak Vermonter. 10 “Bishop?” asks the woman who sits by me on the Amtrak train, reading the name that Ed Perlman has scribbled in Sharpie next to a poem and photocopied as part of a handout packet. “Is that Elizabeth Bishop?” “It is,” I say, not looking over, but knowing that I will be unable to focus on trying to read anything now that I know I am sitting next to a passenger who wants to start a conversation. Are you a teacher?… MFA?… What school?… How far are you riding?… I’m on all the way to Brattleboro… Why are there only five cars? This is the busiest time of year for people to ride this train… I think my irritation shows. It’s interesting—I would be all about having this a conversation in different circumstances, like at a park or some other place where I wouldn’t feel quite so trapped. 11 I met Alice at her new place, a studio in the Eastworks building, Easthampton, Massachusetts. The building is an old mill that was converted into artists’ lofts, I think in the late 1990s. It was—or at least it seems to me that it was—something that started the ongoing upswing of Easthampton, the revitalization that has been establishing it as a nice little inexpensive New England town for a certain type of artist, one who doesn’t need bustle, one who doesn’t need close proximity to the bars and restaurants of Northampton but who does need a yoga instructor. I like the Eastworks building and always have. It is mixed-use, too, which means now that there is a restaurant and bar downstairs as well as the Registry of Motor Vehicles. I open the door to the fourth floor suite and it is an open thing, very spacious, with stairs going up to a loft area that I am told is too messy to show me. Alice and Milton have just moved there within the past month; having a space like this is part of the ongoing project that is the establishing of Alice’s photography business. They are living there, but there is also an area for staging portrait photos. Backdrop, lighting, the whole deal. Although, the best lighting no doubt is that which comes in through the giant windows. I stand in front of them and look out at the mountains. “Congratulations,” I say. I order food to be delivered from the restaurant—Riff’s Joint—downstairs. Alice cooks herself something simple on the stove. Alice shows me photos she is doing as part of an event on the theme of women at work. One of the people of whom she has taken a set of photos is Lyric, my and Alix’s old friend. I knew that Lyric had a baby with Daniel within the past year. I didn’t actually know that she was working as a CNA these days, though. “I was thinking of seeing if she wanted to hang out,” I tell Alice. “You should!” she tells me. Then she is emailing on her phone with a client who is for unclear reasons having difficulty viewing her photos through the gallery interface on the professional web site. Soon I too am occupied by business, when I get a scheduled call from the HealthForceOntario Marketing and Recruitment Agency in order to discuss the questions I have about becoming qualified to work in Canada as an occupational therapist. (This process is intertwined with the even more complex process that is applying to immigrate, and the person I speak to cannot advise on matters of immigration, so I don’t actually get much help aside from moral support, although the moral support is appreciated. ) (She says I’m the only U. S. citizen applying from outside Canada she has ever advised. ) Alice is surprised by this conversation she has overheard, but instead of being skeptical about the idea that I might run away to Canada she seems excited by it. “I would love to visit you in Canada!” she says. “I have a passport now!” We walk the bike path to the center of town and find that good coffee is not available after 3 PM anywhere. “Easthampton is still not there yet,” I say. “I think of late-night coffee as a must. ” Overall, it’s a really good visit with Alice. I’m glad. We drifted apart for a few years there, but she seems to be doing well, and it’s awesome to catch up with her. 12 Then, the part of the visit that made me choose this particular date—my meeting Salma and Eric’s baby, Elena, for the first time! “Do you have all your immunizations?” Salma asks me when I first walk in. “Well, working in health care, I suppose you would have to. ” “Yup,” I say. She says that she has had to ask a couple of her friends to get vaccinated before spending time with Elena: “In the Valley there are kind of a lot of people who don’t trust vaccinations. ” Sitting in the bedroom, talking to Salma, and then to both Salma and Eric, about everything I have missed while out of town. I hold Elena for about an hour, which is probably longer than I’ve ever held a baby before in my life. It’s wonderful. 13 Next I meet up with Harry. He asks me to meet him at Faces, the novelty gift shop that has been around for many years and which in the recent past was expected to close but then didn’t. This seems like an odd choice, but it makes more sense when it becomes apparent that a gal he knows from his kung fu classes works there and he is saying hi to her. She seems quite nice. Harry and I walk for a bit, end up going to Osaka. As normal, although this is a Japanese/sushi restaurant, I get the pad thai. Harry gets gloomy and seethes in frustration when he thinks he is ordering a single side dish involving two types of food but instead is brought an entree, then two separate side dishes. (It turns out in the end that this was indeed a mistake in his reading of the menu. ) Harry is someone who encourages any rambling intellectual talk that comes from my mouth. By the time we have finished our dinner and moved on to the Roost for coffee and cake I am in rare form, responding to things he has said about believing in ghosts. I won’t pretend that these are the actual words I said to Harry or that our talk was this condensed—it was actually a dialogue, for starters—but what follows is the essence of what I was attempting to argue to him: “When people ask questions like ‘Are there ghosts?’ or ‘Is there a God?’ I think there isn’t really an answer to give. The questions are kind of meaningless, I think, except to establish, like, ‘Oh, well, if I say there’s a God and he says there’s a God, then we have something in common and we can bond over that and distinguish our little group from the outside world. ’ But… we establish that a thing is a thing by observing that we can do something with it. And then that process of making a thing a thing is always a simplification, because simplifying the full, uncontrollable, unknowable, immeasurable reality of any thing—even a simple physical thing like a fork or a piece of hair—is what we’re doing when we put a word in that physical object’s place and begin to talk about it. Now, it’s useful to talk about a fork as a thing, because we can observe that when something looks like a fork we can pick it up and eat a piece of cake with it. But in the case of God or a ghost, these are ideas that we only use to describe what can’t be measured. It’s not going to satisfy someone who asks me, ‘Do you believe in ghosts?’ if I answer that I believe in people experiencing feelings of chills or seeing things fall off shelves at suspicious times. That wouldn’t be enough for them. But it’s enough for me to believe in, say, someone having a headache without believing in a particular idea about what’s causing that headache. Right? So if I’m asked, ‘Do I believe?’ my defenses immediately go up. Because I don’t think I should have to worry about believing or disbelieving in the existence of these things. If the thought of communication from a dead relative makes sense for one person in the context of the story that they define themselves through, that’s fine! I don’t look down on that—that’s poetry! But beyond giving that person a way of making sense of the chaos that is being alive, do I believe there is an objective truth to the idea of a soul—the idea that there is some part of a person’s being we can’t consistently observe or measure but which survives past death? No. If we can’t observe or measure them, why do we believe these stories any more than any other? Again, I think religion and superstition, functionally, are really just so people can come together by agreeing over things that can’t be immediately disproven. I think a healthy person, when pushed, doesn’t really believe in anything except as a helpful approximation. I mean, look. This is for all intents and purposes a table, and I’m comfortable with that. It’s more or less brown. And if someone tells me that actually, the wavelength of the light being reflected is more yellow or something and that it’s just some trick of my mind that makes it look brown, I’ll say, ‘Oh, cool. But you knew what I meant, and all I needed to do was convey an abstraction of this, this small area of matter in the universe, which is comprised of countless molecules that are constantly changing, whose beginning and end is hazy and hard to determine. ’” Then we went to karaoke, where I drank wine and sang. 14 Saturday I met up with Lyric. We walked through Easthampton. I met her and Daniel’s daughter, who if I remember correctly is something like eleven months old. Lyric seems to be doing well. She is still a shy, awkward person, but her anxiety seems mellowed, at least today. She walks confidently through the bright summer weather, carrying a big purse and eating a cup of ice cream while the baby sleeps in a baby carrier slung over the front of her body. “You’re a pro!” I say, to which she looks confused and says, “Well, I’m wearing her, so it’s not difficult. ” But it’s a great thing, whether she recognizes it or not. I surely would never take it for granted that a first-time mother would be so ready to be out and about, walking through town, completing errands on her own, looking not weary but actually more energetic than I have usually seen her be in the past. After I grab a wrap and fries from Antonio’s (and follow her lead by getting some ice cream for myself at Mount Tom’s Ice Cream, too) we walk to her place to sit in the grass briefly. Daniel joins us, stepping out of the messy apartment with three IPAs. The baby crawls, chasing after the cans. Daniel talks to me about the Narrative Medicine program at Columbia. I’m beginning to surprise myself a little with how easily I explain what the department is all about. Even in general, my ability to articulate ideas orally has improved substantially even just in the past year. Eventually it gets dark. They’re going inside. I say that I should get going. I get back to Chicopee. 15 As I arranged earlier during the trip, I drive to Paxton to my grandmother’s house. She is ninety years old now, perhaps a bit forgetful at times but overall appearing still very active and in very good shape for her age. My aunt Madeline and her son are living with her now. My weekend in Massachusetts just happens to be coinciding with the (very) small celebration of Madeline’s birthday and the birthday of my cousin Eric’s son, Gabriel. Madeline has brought two young dogs into the house, both from the same litter. She says that she was leaving the animal shelter with the one they call Blue (for the blue collar he had been given) when one of the people at the shelter said, “We just have to find a home for Red, now. ” As she tells she the story, she just had to meet Red, then: Red was a name that her father—my grandfather—was often known by, even long after his hair had turned white. So then there were two black dogs going back to Paxton with her. The phone rings while I am talking with my grandmother in her kitchen. “If that’s your father, do you want to talk to him?” she asks me. I think for few seconds. I look at and say aloud the area code of the incoming caller. I don’t recognize it. “Yeah, that’s him,” she says. “Okay,” I say. So, after a couple of minutes of listening to whatever he was calling about, she hands the phone to me. “Hello,” I say. “Who is this?” “Your son. ” “I thought so! That’s a surprise to find you there. ” “Yeah, I’m up for a visit to Massachusetts, so I got in touch to see if I could stop by. ” “That’s good. And it’s been years, too, hasn’t it?” “No, actually,” I say. “I came here last year, I think. I just didn’t mention it to you. ” He takes the opportunity of having me on the phone to ask questions about my plans to move to New York. When we’re done I hand the phone back to my grandmother. In that same old house I remember from the 1900s, when she still hung clothes to dry on a clothesline. 16 Plans originally had me going to a wine tasting with Jen, but a relative of hers has had a medical emergency, so we don’t manage to meet up. 17 Bruce has not come down from the upstairs space—which is where he has been living—since before I arrived. My mom has said, “He probably doesn’t even know you’re here. I didn’t tell him. He hasn’t been stopping down here in the morning like he usually would, because I was mad at him. ” But today he is down there, looking at something on my mom’s computer, with her there. He and my mom ask how was Grandma’s, and all the normal follow-up questions. “Your mother told me you needed a backpack. I have a really good one here, it just needs to be cleaned,” Bruce says. “We also got you a couple of clipboards,” says my mom. “What do you need them for?” Bruce asks. “My son’s going on an adventure,” my mom says with a sigh. “Yeah, it’s Burning Man. ” “Oh! I know that. ” Bruce turns my mom. “I saw that on TV. It looks really interesting. It’s where every year they go to Nevada and make a big arts community in the desert. ” “That’s a better description of it than I was expecting,” I say. It’s true: when I saw the recognition in his eye I was expecting him to say that Burning Man was a hippie music festival, or for him to characterize it as a nudist rave. Of course, then I have to answer all my mother’s questions: “Well, how are you getting all those supplies there, then?” “What happens if you get hurt?” And so on, and so on. But the good thing about having this conversation only a month before the event is that I have researched and planned for every aspect of anything she could possibly ask about. “Yes, it’s a very complex thing to plan for. That’s part of the experience,” I say. 18 Text messages from Alix, saying that she and her boyfriend are finished with the business they had in Northampton and that they are ready to come and pick me up. I rub my eyes, not quite awake enough to remain sitting in bed. I ask for a slight delay. I had expected plans involving Alix to start off behind schedule, not ahead of schedule. I shower, get in a few sips of coffee and a few bites of a muffin, gather what I think is all of my stuff, and pack it into my bags. I go out to the car and meet her boyfriend, Peter. I didn’t know he would be in his late fifties. He shakes my hand, grabs my bags, and places them in the trunk of his car. My mother is meanwhile uncharacteristically watching me from the front door, holding a barking Kaylee, watching me leave. She brings out the coffee cup that I intentionally abandoned. I wave it off. Then we’re on the Mass Pike. Peter drives quickly but carefully. The plan is for him to drop us off somewhere, then something something, and I guess I’m getting a hotel? Something. But, yeah. I get the squares of greater Boston mixed up. Central Square and Harvard Square I know, but then there are Porter Square, Davis Square, Circle Square, Hiptubee Square, and to me they’re all just fine to visit but in no case are they exceptional. There is still a familiarity I can feel about some of the passersby I encounter when walking through Cambridge or Somerville—a certain mutual acknowledgment I feel I can pick up on as another gentle soul walking alone dressed all in black passes me on a summer’s day—but today these cities feel more mundane than interesting as we drive through them, then park in one of them. I leave my luggage (full of clothes n’ things) but take the leather computer bag that holds my technology, school stuff, and planners. Alix and I sit with coffee. She gets a phone call, which ends up lasting a long time, from someone who by the end of the phone call has become a new client for her web development and consulting or whatever. She still smokes as many cigarettes as she ever did, outside on benches or standing against walls. It feels inconsiderate in the year 2015, and if I were to relapse and begin smoking again I wouldn’t be able to bring myself to do it in many of these spots. But Alix’s confidence makes it all feel okay, the way it felt okay fifteen years ago. After coffee we move on to a pub. We have a few drinks, although it’s only early afternoon on a Monday. I inquire about her present life and she mentions being involved in political issues. “Like what?” I ask, and for an example she gives opposing the bid for Boston to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. “Oh, good,” I say. “I’m glad to hear you say you’re against that. ” Because the small bit I had heard about that had sounded dumb, and because I think hosting an Olympic games is probably a dumb idea for a city in most cases, anyway. She talks in detail about the circumstances of that bid and everything that’s wrong with it. Then we take a restroom break. As I wait for her to join me back at the table, I see (checking my Facebook feed on my new iPhone) that someone has posted an article saying the Boston 2024 bid has been withdrawn. I hold my phone up for Alix to see as she walks back from the restroom. “What!” she says. “I thought we were going to be fighting that until the fall!” She tells me that due to CVS giving her a hard time about renewing her prescription for Valium after thirty days instead of thirty-one, she is in withdrawal: “So that’s why I’m so mean. ” “I haven’t noticed you being mean at all,” I say. She has even leaned cutely against me in a closed storefront and said, “I love you”—not what I would call an unkind gesture. “Well, you wouldn’t recognize me if I were actually on my meds, then,” she says. We take the T somewhere, for some purpose. We walk for several blocks through the hot and humid weather before she asks me, “Shouldn’t we be going in the other direction?” I stop. “Are you saying you were following me? This is my visit to your city! I have no clue where we are!” So we walk back. She has learned by checking on her phone that the prescription she needs has been refilled after all, so we back out of whatever we were planning to do and head to get her pills. Ironically, it is just after she takes her prescription that she actually hurts my feelings. Describing how she has quietly been having mean thoughts all day, she says something about how she has kept thinking mean things, “Like, ‘Oh, you’re fat’. ” Which may have been a reference to how she described Jonny as he had aged the last time she happened to see him on the street: a basketball-shaped gut, receding hairline, and so forth. At that point I said, “You’re describing me!” and she said, “No, I’m not. I’m describing a sketchball. ” But as we walk then through a thrift store, I reference it again, and she doesn’t try to disavow the notion that she thinks I’m fat. Then I jokingly allude to it once again as we wait for a bus to take us to where Peter is going to meet us, and all she says is, “You’re not really fat. You could be buff if you just did five sit-ups a day. ” From this point on she starts asking if I’m tired, because I’m so quiet. I say yes, but really I’m just so self-conscious about my appearance that I no longer have anything to say to her and no longer want to be in public. To an extent, I never want to be in public. I really do exercise every day until I stop having time for it. I diet until something stops me. I’ve just barely been meeting my responsibilities. I think to myself, Why can’t I be exercising right now. Why did I come to visit friends. Why. Why. But she has Peter drop me off at a hotel. She hands me a one hundred dollar bill in the lobby to pay for my stay. We hug and she leaves, planning to have dinner in the morning before I go to the airport. "

    "body": "19 In the morning I get an email notification that my flight has been canceled. The reason for this cancellation is unclear. This is fairly mind-blowing in the context of all the other problems I already have been having with American Airlines. I call and reschedule for later in the day. This choice leads to Peter dropping off me and Alix to walk from the Boston Common to the harbor and back, with a couple of stops inside clothing stores. Eventually I only have a couple of hours left until my new departure time, so I ask what the planned timeline is. Alix has difficulty getting a hold of Peter. Peter hasn’t flown since the twentieth century, which is likely why he has unrealistic expectations of how quickly one can make it from the entrance of an airport to one’s airplane. He thinks twenty minutes should be enough. Inside the terminal I’m not able to get a ticket from the American Airlines kiosk, so I just give up then and there. As arranged, Peter and Alix are still waiting outside in Peter’s car for me. After checking my phone I say that a somewhat affordable Amtrak train is departing in ninety minutes or so from South Station. While I’m receiving a ride there I call American Airlines once again to request that my replacement ticket be canceled and that I get a refund instead. I’m surprised that this, the least reasonable thing I have requested from this airline, is the first thing they agree to without hassle. It’s a long train ride, but comfortable. I sit with no one next to me all the way back. I have my devices plugged in. I chat with Rosalyn, who is predictably and understandably in rough shape. 20 I left Massachusetts. Back to Virginia. Immediately back to doing therapy visits. And classes. Writing poetry for the poetry class; fiction for the fiction workshop. On Friday, July 31 I saw KMFDM at the State Theatre in Falls Church. They are not an act I have listened to very much over the years, but I have been missing the goth/industrial culture. By sheer coincidence I have met the singer of the first opening act, since Jonny played in his previous band while living in Florida. I had to read another book and write about it for my workshop class. I went with Ragtime by E. L. Doctorow. Then it was August. The demands of my job picked up. I saw Desaparecidos at the 9:30 Club. Felt a bit tired that night, but just stood against the back wall, watched from there. I did training so I’ll be able to pick up PRN shifts at a rehab center in Annandale. Oh, and Cayetana playing with Chumped in Baltimore at the Metro Gallery. That was August 12. The second time I’ve seen Chumped, both times at shows I would have gone to anyway. It had been them whose album release party I was going to go to at Suburbia, which is really just a house in Brooklyn, that weekend when I went to New York and stayed at the Jane. (I’ll be staying at the Jane once again twelve nights from now, as it happens. ) Tonight is August 18. I just got out of my last class at Johns Hopkins before the thesis course that happens in the Fall semester. I left feeling a little bummed, which I should know by now is the inevitable result whenever I try to represent in fiction my life and the lives of people I have known, loved and respected. The writing style and voice is complimented, but it seems any characters I write who do not resemble Hollywood films of the past ten years are despised. I drive home, thinking: I love to write, but this failure to communicate to a literary audience is the part that sucks. I think I might institute a “one for me, one for you” policy, in which, insomuch as I continue to write fiction, I try to alternate, writing one story that attempts to put into words the deep complexity and beauty of human experience, then another that flatters the bourgeois and their belief in their own supremacy. Because perhaps the stories from the latter category will draw in some who will give thoughts to the efforts made in the former. And if not, writing is fun anyway, so whatever. 21 “So,” I say to Rosalyn on the phone, “Next semester it’s just my thesis class, and then I’ll be done at Johns Hopkins. I’ll have my second Master’s degree. ” “Wow,” she says. “You were a slow burn, but you are full speed ahead now. ” 22 Aug. 30, 2015. I watch out the window from seat 29F as baggage is loaded onto a conveyor belt by guys in neon vests and what I assume are noise-canceling headphones. This is an American Airlines flight from Reagan Airport to Kennedy Airport—Washington to New York. Seat 29F is kind to me today: I am the only person on this flight who has an entire aisle to himself. Good job, Levi! Window seat, second row from the rear of the plane, for the win. Except, weirdly enough, for the guy who sat down in the aisle seat just as I was writing this, while the plane was already in motion. Where did he come from? But at least I still have room to cross my legs and let my foot protrude into the space where the lap of the person in 29E would be. A video plays on the screens that hang above every third row of seats. A recording explains important safety information that I do not pay attention to. Then the screens automatically retract, and the plane rolls toward its designated airport. September will be the most ambitious, most non-stop month of my life so far. This seems pretty certain. And this is the most astonishing portion of all, the time it all starts. My orientation at Columbia University… leading into six nights and five days at Burning Man, a. k. a. Black Rock City, the temporary city built in a Nevada desert once per year… leading into my handing in a first draft of my fiction thesis at Johns Hopkins University… then my returning to my job as a home health occupational therapist in northern Virginia… and beginning the process for immigration into Canada. Oh, hey. The plane is accelerating. Oh, hey. The plane is lifting off. Oh, hey. I’m flying. 23 Still in the air. I’m looking out over the Chesapeake Bay. I like flying. Last week, I drove all the way up to Chicopee… I worked at the facility in Annandale I’ve been filling at. Then I did one home visit. Then I drove up north, then headed east across Pennsylvania once I hit Harrisburg, then took 15 and 91 to get from New York to western Massachusetts. I had no time to make social calls, only slept on the couch with Kaylee the puppy, practiced setting up a tent and shade structure with my mom’s help in her yard, then packed what I could into my Chevy Cruze. I drove to Manhattan to set up and move things into a storage locker in Chelsea. The things I moved included a bag of things needed for Burning Man, plus my keyboard, old Nintendo and Super Nintendo console games, and other stuff like that. I returned to Virginia. I kept thinking of last-minute supplies to buy for Burning Man. I kept not quite getting around to catching up on all the backlog of therapy documentation I was hoping I would get around to… and I had to cancel the plans I had been setting up with Alix to have her come and visit this weekend. Still in the air. 24 It’s a long subway ride from JFK to Greenwich Village. With a small tote bag and a heavy backpack I pass by Big Gay Ice Cream—maybe later, I think—and stop in for some food at a pizza place. It’s a fairly small shop with two entrances—one to the left of the counter, one to the right. The clouds outside start raining. One mistake that people who have not really spent time in New York make is imagining that Manhattan, being so full of so many people who are out and doing so many different things, feels on the whole the way it does at Times Square, the Empire State Building, or in transit centers. But tonight, as the rain suddenly pours for just a minute, the humble expressions of the people remind me that it is the city itself which is big and busy. The people, meanwhile, live out the same variety of moments—rushed and relaxed, pleasant and uncomfortable—as in other settings. But unlike in a small town, where the water dripping from your brow can feel important and might be the cause for a conversation with the first person you see (“I just parked across the street! Then it started raining, and I was soaked to the bone by the time I got here!”), your unplanned shower takes place while dozens of others might literally be standing above you, in offices or condominium units, with problems that everyone knows are more important than yours. (The city, I think, is not for big people, necessarily, but for people who fit well into big situations. ) By the time I step out from the pizza shop the brief shower has passed. I walk to the Jane, set my things down in the tiny little room, walk to the corner store to grab something in case my stomach demands it later. It’s too hot in the non-air-conditioned room to wear more than my briefs. I hang a towel over the mirror so I don’t have to look at my body. I document for work. Then the alarm is going off. I planned to get up early, to get some stuff done, including more of that documentation. It still is pretty early when the OT filling in for one of my patient discharges is giving me a call. I talk to her about the patient. Then I shave my face in the shared bathroom as men and women in bathrobes walk in and out of showers and stalls. I shower too, hitting the little buttons on the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash dispensers inside the shower. Down to the front desk again, pretty much right on the dot for the 12 PM check-out time. The backpack really is heavy and the weather really is both hot and humid, but at least I happen to walk past Chelsea Market, which is nicely air conditioned and a good spot to pick up a quick lunch before continuing on to the next place I want to get to. I remember where the men’s room is, more or less, from when Esther took me here. Today the line for the men’s room is prohibitively long, though, so blah. Food. Then a taxi to my storage locker. I use the restroom there. My key card doesn’t convince the elevator to take me to the correct floor, so I go the desk where the same guy who was there the last time is helping another customer. I leave because I’m running out of time and don’t want to be late for my orientation. Yet another taxi ride, then—this time to the 28th Street subway stop, and a subway ride uptown to Columbia University, which I don’t think my mom has ever heard of and whose location Rosalyn shockingly did not know (“What city is that in?” she asked). But I am so excited to be attending there. Some kids dream of being famous actors, but I dreamed, especially after dropping out of high school, of finding my way somehow to college at a world-class institution. It was one of those recurring fantasies that I told myself at the time was such a pipe dream I should not even bother thinking about it. But it showed something important to my character, I think, because it was a fantasy of something that would mean more to me than success. I knew from a young age, after all, that success meant different things to different people. But if I could get myself by virtue of merit, persistence, and creativity into one of those magical universities—an MIT or a Princeton or a Columbia—it would mean that the mechanisms rigging society were not as perfect as they seemed. In other words, there might be hope for me, but also for others as well, if I could become Smart through smarts alone. That I am in fact remaining true to myself while receiving access to an experience at Columbia feels like a huge validation of my optimistic tendencies. There is a line in front of the building we’ve been told by email this orientation will be at. The orientation is for all incoming Masters of Science students within the School of Continuing Education. I wait in line, step inside the refreshingly air conditioned building, and the fire alarm goes off. At this point I walk over to the table with a piece of paper reading “Narrative Medicine” on it and grab my Columbia University student ID. Then I go outside and hurry across the street to Starbucks. I’m no fool; I know the Starbucks will be a much more comfortable place than the sidewalk to wait for the go-ahead to re-enter the orientation. It doesn’t take long for us to get the all clear, though. By the time I have my coffee and water it’s already time for me to follow the line into the auditorium. People fill in, sitting in the chairs. I still have not just my tote bag but also the heavy one that I was planning to drop off at my storage locker. The first speaker gives us a general welcome and introduction to the School of Continuing Education, whose largest program is Actuarial Science and which also has such programs as (if I am remembering them correctly) Bioethics and Conflict Resolution. Next up are several speakers who go over at quite some length topics of gender-based violence, partner abuse, sexual assault, and discrimination against protected classes (e. g. , racial, religious, or based on sexual orientation). Then there is a breakout session. All the incoming Narrative Medicine students walk, following each other in a long line and impressively not getting lost as we cross the crowded campus. Then we’re in a classroom, where forty-ish seats have been arranged into a circle. We are the largest incoming class so far, by far, we are told before we each briefly introduce who we are and what our background is. I’m impressed by all the students. I was expecting more med school hopefuls just looking to pad their resumés but not actually having much of a humanities background. It seems that I was underestimating the program’s screening process. Many of the students are med school hopefuls, but generally they are also artists with MFAs or people who did English or Comparative Literature degrees in undergrad. The faculty, too, come across really well in my view, and I find myself wanting to take all the classes they talk about. Then we walk to the reception. The itinerary for this day, as described on a web site somewhere, was vague about this, and I am not excited for it. I’m more hoping to show up, ensure that it is indeed something I do not care about missing, and then head downtown to the open mic night at the Sidewalk Café. I’m the last in the caravan of students and faculty, because I’ve been poking at my iPad, attempting without success to register for my first classes before anyone else beats me to it. (I’m counting on being able to take two classes on Mondays. ) Wherever we’ve been led to is empty, I guess: we’re redirected to where we just walked from. I don’t understand it, but we enter a room full of students from other M. S. programs, where there is an open bar and musicians playing instrumental jazz and things like coconut shrimp being served on trays by smiling catering staff. Only two of the approximately seven windows is open to the view of the city… which shouldn’t be really that interesting at all from the second story, right? But I am in general just into city views, and this is my preview of a new period of my life in which I get to know the largest, most famous, most metropolitan of American cities—a city I never knew I would one day feel ready and eager for. I get wine, step around. Think to myself, Eh. This is why some students make a point of chatting with one of their peers in depth right off the bat, isn’t it? So that they know with whom they’ll be chatting once they’ve been led into a mixer like this. But there’s an empty table, so I stand at that. Two of the faculty approach me. Well, that’s nice of them to approach the guy who’s standing alone, I think. But then a funny thing happens: I don’t have to move from the table at all from that point in the evening on. The younger instructor, Danielle Spencer, sticks around and talks to me about her experiences as a student in the program, how she was associated with the university and so knew some of those already teaching and was inspired to apply to it that way, and how she actually has thought of becoming an OT herself. I tell my story about sitting at my laptop in a Chipotle Mexican Grill and seeing a banner ad for the program next to an unrelated New York Times article and saying aloud, “Shut up and take my application!” and she laughs an exaggerated mouth-full-of-wine laugh. Meanwhile the older professor comes and goes, and I get her to advise me on what parts of the world I should travel to, and the three of us all talk about our shared preference for colder weather over warmer weather, and then, when all the incoming students for one of the other programs is gathering together for a group photograph, I realize that the three of us are the only ones left from Narrative Medicine, and I thank them for the company and smile my way back to the subway. The key card problem at my storage place is taken care of. I stash my stuff and take a bus to the Sidewalk Café. I drink one glass of wine. I sit listening to music. I’ve already decided to become a regular at this open mic. It seems to be exactly what I was hoping it would be like. I step back out from the performance area to the front bar area to ask for a coffee and a beer. A gal sits down right next to me and looks in my direction until I acknowledge her. She’s young, made-up, pretty, hair tied into a bun at the top of her head. I prove to myself that I’ve still got it by taking her flirtation and turning it into a deep discussion of her fears and insecurities. (I am at my most confident in exactly this situation—where the more vulnerable party is the attractive person talking to me and there would be no ethical way for me to, like, just start making out with her. So I simply express genuine interest in her, ask personal questions, and eventually she is alluding to her ongoing mental health concerns, which turns into a talk about mental health care more broadly and then also about my profession. In the end she’s asking if she can give me her Facebook information, or something like that, and I say yes, but she is too drunk and insecure, I guess, to hear it as a yes when I add, “And you’ll also be here anyway when I come back another week, right?” So I don’t actually get her contact information. My last words to her are, “See you at the Sidewalk, then!” even though we are at the Sidewalk as I am saying it. But, whatever. Then I reply to Rosalyn’s invitation to call, which she posted on Facebook, and I talk to her until I am on the bus that takes me to the hotel where I wait for the shuttle that I have paid to take me to the airport that will take me to Dallas/Ft. Worth, where I will transfer to a plane that will take me to… 25 Reno, Nevada. Where, after sleeping very well on the first leg of my flight (with no one else in my aisle!) and less well on the second leg of my flight (squished next to a couple, who also looked like they were going to Burning Man) I see Julian. Hi, Julian! And he offers to wait for my luggage while I take a cab to the FedEx Office location where I need to pick up the bag I mailed in advance. I get into the first taxi cab I see. “Where to?” the driver asks me. I give him the address. “I thought maybe you were going to the Burning Man,” he says. “I am! I’m picking up a package full of supplies that I mailed. ” “It’s a wonderful thing,” he tells me about the event. He says that he went several times, years ago, and that it made him realize how “all the shit, the things you buy, the big house, it’s all bullshit. The only things you have at the end of your life? The experiences you’ve lived. ” He gives me a bit of his story, how he came from Greece, “And what people from Greece do when they come to the United States is open restaurants,” but how he found that in his case that was not profitable and so he became a cab driver, which he enjoys much more. He advises me not to buy or sell any drugs while on the playa, due to the prevalence of various types of law enforcement there. I quickly pick up my luggage and step back out into the parking lot. He loads my bag into the trunk and we drive back towards the airport. It’s then that I notice something dangling from the car ignition. “Oh, wow, you’ve got the Man on your keychain!” meaning the Burning Man logo. “Oh, yeah! I told you, I’m the real deal!” he says. He wishes me a good burn. I head back into the airport. "

    "title": "XXIII. The Inevitable Burn (26-33)",
    "body": "26 The Burner Express bus takes Julian and me into the desert, stopping at a supermarket for food and water along the way. Once we’re on the playa and the bus passengers are getting out—(this is the third year of the bus service, which, they have told us, has doubled in usage each year compared to the last)—virgin burners are called over for their ritual initiation, a roll in the dust. Julian does this, but I’m busy retrieving, gathering together, and standing watch over our bags. And I don’t much care for ritual initiations, anyway. We walk just across the way to the camp designated for Burner Express riders. Julian has never set up a tent before; I have only done so maybe twice? Like, there was the time I went on my “vision quest” in order to get my Associate’s degree—there was that time—and then there was the weekend before last, when I practiced setting up for this here burn. My plan was for Julian and I to each have separate tents. The problem that I encounter immediately relates to the tent that I didn’t practice setting up, which I’m not sure how to stake down with the various stakes I have. So, then, I go through the process of putting up the dome tent, and Julian takes the lead more once we’re securing the tarp that’s over it to provide shade. A few people come by and ask if we need help. I invite recommendations on how to engineer everything. One person says, “This’ll be a good shade structure; I’d just put two lines this way and secure them here,” which we do. The most common thing we hear, although it is too late to correct by the time we hear it, is that we have set it up facing the prevailing winds. It’s sunset when we get everything inside the tent. We walk to Center Camp. I get a coffee, plus something that is not a coffee for Julian. Then, walking out onto the open playa—the open space of the u-shaped city design, where the Man stands and where mutant vehicles, many of them enlarged parade floats, with multiple levels of Burners dancing to EDM on them, drive. Any one of a dozen lit up art installations within our immediate view would in another context be startling, ridiculous, and worth telling lots of people about the following day. But we can just keep walking and in a hundred yards it’s a different dozen of equally intricate projects that various groups have put months of effort into building specifically for the Burn. And because, as I said before, much of this art moves, and because the people walking and cycling by are themselves art, with all of us lit up, the view in each moment is unique, fantastic, and impossible to hold on to. We try stopping at a few camps that have set themselves up as bars… but none of that seems to work out. No one welcomes us in. It’s all sort of weird vibes. We have both had long days, anyway, and so we go to sleep in our cramped little tent at around nine or ten o’clock. That’s the end of our Tuesday. We’re not planning to leave until Monday. 27 Wednesday is too hot, although it isn’t actually all that hot. It’s still better camping weather than one would be likely to find anywhere along the east coast at the start of September. Julian and I split up for a time; I doubt being alone is really his preference, but he knows me. While he is out I nap, I write into a journal book, and I try to get my unwashed hair into something like a style despite my not knowing where the hand-held mirror I packed is. Somehow, when I dig through my bags, I can only find things like the jar of vegemite that I packed just in case I happen to come across an Australian looking for some. I walk to Center Camp, but I’m learning that it gets too crowded at certain points in the day, especially after the dust has been blowing and people have come in to get away from it. The port-o-potties are conveniently located right next to where our tent is set up, but they are inconveniently over-utilized ones. It’s late afternoon when Julian returns to find what has happened to our tent, which I am sitting inside: the zipper has come off its track and the fabric around it has ripped. After futile attempts to secure the opening with duct tape, the solution turned out to be those clasp things that, like, will be used in an office environment to secure a bunch of papers together. It hadn’t even been my idea to pack these; my mom had handed me a plastic bag of them after we tested out the tent. Anyway, Julian is unconcerned with the state of the tent. He collapses into it, shirtless, and says that he needs a nap. I tell him to drink water. He tells me that he got two portraits taken today—one posed picture, taken by a professional photographer, and one picture of his genitals printed out onto a “genital I. D. badge” taken (in Julian’s words) “by presumably not a professional photographer. ” He drinks a little bit of water and starts falling asleep. I get my things together and walk out. I write at the Center Camp Café for a while. I walk a bit. I’m happier as the sun sets. Back at the tent, Julian is still asleep, but my return wakes him up. He recognizes that he gave himself mild heat exhaustion. He drinks more water. He takes some time pulling himself together, then comes out with me, out onto the playa. We walk in the direction of the Man. People in tutus and furry leg warmers dance on animal-shaped cars. The platform for the Man has a bunch of carnival-themed stuff around it. A marionette of a skeleton, maybe thirty or forty feet tall, which people running and pulling chains are able to control. Stand in front of a wall that has a camera mounted on it, see a colored and pixelated visualization of yourself that moves in real time in front of you. Get your fortune from someone standing in a box and dressed in the fashion of a character from an old-timey mechanical fortune-giving machine. A mock Apple store: see the shiny front, then walk around to the back to see the less shiny conditions of where the products are manufactured. In the base of the Man itself, a maze. Find your way through and you can get up to the upper level, stand at the legs of the Man, look out over the playa and see the half-circle, lights everywhere like at a county fair, but the largest you’ve seen for sure, and flames shooting into the air over here and over there. But eventually we have crawled back into that tiny tent and slept and it’s Thursday and I’m glad to sleep in and to let Julian just go about and do his burn again, and while kneeling and moving bags from where they are stacked on top of each other at the sides of the tent and cleaning my body with baby wipes in lieu of showering and searching for and searching for and finally finding the fan/water mister that I can use to wet my hair, although of course I still can’t wash it—and oh, good, finally I found that mirror, too. Yesterday was dusty, very dusty, with lots of short dust storms, and someone I overheard said that it was the dustiest day she had ever seen on the playa, and Burning Man has its origins in San Francisco, some thing some guy did on a beach, burning his old self down or something like that, and that annual ritual combined with this group and that group and that attitude and this. To the bus depot on Rod’s Road. Mostly the roads are just based around the times of a clock, with the open playa being what’s in this shape, almost like a C, but if you’re on the Esplanade (where the camps meet the open playa) at any point you’re just as close to the Man as you would be anywhere else along the Esplanade. But Rod’s Road is an exception, for some reason. There’s a shuttle that runs to the nearby towns of Gerlach and Empire a few times every day. Ten dollars, although otherwise at Burning Man only ice and the drinks at the Center Camp Cafe cost money. Get a wristband, make sure you have your ticket stub on you, ride past the side gate where one of the volunteer Burning Man staff gets on the bus and says, “So, how many people on this bus? And you’ve all got wristbands? Show me how tight the wristbands are on, everybody. And your ticket stubs? You’ll need them to get back in. Okay, it looks like you all have tickets. ” And the dust blows and settles, blows and settles, and mountains on all sides. Playa a beige-white color, the consistency of baby powder. Gerlach is just a few places of business, restaurants, but no general store. I walk into the smoothie place run by a very nice family, but instead of getting a smoothie I buy six of the bottles of water they have there (which, they don’t have many). Then I walk next door to the pizza place, get a slice of pizza and a bag of chips and a can of Dr. Pepper. I leave my cell phones plugged in, but I don’t have long, because the bus will be back from its trip out to Empire in about twenty-five minutes or something like that. So I get back to the desert with some water and also an extra can of soda for Julian. We still will need more water before the burn is over. Another afternoon dust storm happens. Julian comes back to the tent just after I myself have arrived there. Nightfall, and we get it into our heads to follow the event guidebook after all, to pursue the Planet Earth nightclub and their fun-sounding events. So, we get there and it’s all The Cure and The Smiths being played, and I dance it up, and Julian kind of does, too, but then he asks if I want to move on, and I don’t, actually, but I agree to leave. I really liked that place, I’m thinking to myself as we step out, el wire wrapped around us and blinking, each length of light connected to a battery pack that is pocket-sized. Goth dancing always felt like dancing at the end of the world to me, and there I just was, dancing in a space that would in fact be torn down in several days, in a city that would be torn down in several days. I drink from the absinthe I have mixed with water and sugar and taken in a bottle to carry with me. And when the absinthe I’ve brought for the night is gone I move on to red wine. And if you keep walking across the playa away from all the lights and into the dark spaces you come upon unexpected installations. And maybe you’ll understand what they are supposed to mean, and maybe you won’t. But then you’ll try to look back to determine which direction you were trying to walk, but you’ll find that the thing you were looking for is gone. Was it on wheels? Maybe it was on wheels. Or is it on fire now, intentionally immolated? It’s gone to somewhere, to somewhen, while your back has been turned. 28 The next day, when I take the bus out I take it with Julian, and we go all the way to Empire. We’re given about fifteen minutes to pick up some stuff, grab a little bit of food and water and some Gatorade for Julian. At the Gerlach stop on the way back, a woman runs up and says she would like a ride to the gate. To my surprise the driver says he can drop her off at the front gate as we drive toward the side gate. And the young woman sits down and immediately begins talking to the young man in front of me—the young white man with dreadlocks—but I don’t hear what they’re saying, and by the time Julian and I are back at our tent we are in whiteout conditions, the wind is blowing against our tent harder than it has done yet, and the clasps are getting blown off sometimes, and we and everything we have with us is coated with a substantial layer of dust. But finally it does in fact die down. The guide book tells us that there’s a night of musical mash-ups happening at the camp called Automatic Subconscious. We walk our way there. It’s unusual for people to navigate Burning Man without bikes, but I find that it really isn’t bad at all. The biggest problem is cyclists behaving toward pedestrians the way drivers often behave toward cyclists. Also difficult is having to put up with the strangers who behave obnoxiously toward me, like the guy who sees me trying to walk around him who then moves to get in my way, then moves to get in my way yet again when I move again to get out of his way, then stares blankly and does not step away when I shine my flashlight repeatedly into his face. Finally he hugs me and allows me to walk on. Another example: a guy walks up to me. “You! Yeah, you! Do you like girls?” I wait a few seconds, look him in the eye. “Yes,” I say. And he leaves. There are times when the Burning Man principle of “radical self-expression” starts to look like my experiences of being accosted in middle school by kids I didn’t know. But anyway, the mash-up thing is happening in a dome. People are dancing in it. People are climbing the outside to sit at the top of the dome, and also to rest in the hammock nets that hang between the top sections of the skeleton of the dome. Julian and I sit on cushions next to a couple of guys who, lying down, explain that they are “melting”. Julian loves to listen to this music, but he finds it stressful to try to dance in public. We walk on. We fail to find a karaoke-and-pizza event that is listed in the event guide. Walk to Planet Earth again, where I dance for a good long while. A Seth-Rogan-y guy taps me on the shoulder. “This could be you!” he exclaims, pointing to the wild hair of a member of the band Flock of Seagulls on a poster for another New Wave dance event. “Oh?” I say, because, I don’t know, what does one say to that? And he looks a bit embarrassed, holds a thermos out to me, asks, “Want some vodka?” I decline and resume my dancing to New Order or Depeche Mode or whatever happens to be playing. So, yes, there is some obnoxiousness here, and that has been outweighing the good when it comes to how interactions with other folks have gone. I prefer Black Rock City at night by far: during the day is when I hear (or think I hear) comments from passersby, like, “Interesting way to dress—don’t dress for the event at all” or just otherwise see that people think—and yes, it really feels this way-that I am a weirdo for being fully dressed in a basic all-black outfit. Well, and I’ve also tried wearing skirts, too, but that’s when I get people being weird toward me in other ways, as with the guy who asked me if I liked girls. I’m surprised. I’ve liked most of the Burners I’ve encountered over the years, and I’ve found them to be curious and interesting characters… but being at the event itself I’ve found myself thinking that this a place made much more for extroverts, for people who enjoy yelling and being yelled at by strangers (with and without megaphones) than for people like me, whose happiest state of being is a more autonomous one. We go back to that mash-up event again, and we sit on the floor again for a bit, before returning to our tent and sleeping through a cold, cold night. The next night will be when the Man burns. 29 As always, I try to sleep through as much of the day as I can—after my morning coffee, lying down in the tent, battery-operated fan blowing close to my face. Although it has been a dusty week, today everything is still. I leave the top of the still-zipperless tent door unclasped to let some of the hot air out. Julian has been trying to figure out how he will get back to Reno on Monday. I have a ticket on the 6 AM Burner Express bus, but he forgot to buy his ticket for the return trip, and the purchase deadline passed before he realized this. At around 6 PM we find ourselves walking out onto the open playa, seeing things we haven’t seen yet, like the statue of a woman whose base reads, in repeated words, something like, “I am you are me and we are everywhere,” which, viewed in the same frame as the man, just as the sun moved behind the mountains that surround the desert on all sides, was pretty rad. And before long, Black Rock City rangers were keeping people outside the circumference of a circle set by lights in the sand. Julian wants to be as close as we can be, so we sit down at a spot just outside of the circle. I walk to get one last coffee, come back, get waved to by Julian, sit down next to my backpack with the “TEXT AND DRIVE! YOU’LL PROBABLY BE FINE!” sticker I got custom-printed specifically for Burning Man. I overhear a conversation taking place among the people sitting just next to us, and I can’t believe my luck. An Australian. is trying to describe. Vegemite. to some Americans. I reach into my bag and manifest the jar for them. “Are you from Australia?” asks the Australian gal. “Why do you have a jar of vegemite?” “I’m not Australian,” I said. “I just had a feeling somebody would want it. ” 30 I’ve never cared especially much about fire spinning, but by now the desert has gone dark; art cars are parked in a semicircle behind where the people are standing—not blasting music now, but lighting up and shooting the occasional burst of fire. The people? Forget about the people. People get stupid when they’re trying to interact with each other. But here are ten of the best fire-twirling shows that you’ll ever see, happening simultaneously at different points around the circle, so that any direction you faced the Man from would allow you an excellent view of a performance. Two men with flaming swords mock fight with each other. Several women twirl around blazing items around their arms, necks, ankles. The performers step in and out. It seems like different routines have different leaders, who stand in front and call out to the others but then stand back and have less involvement in the other routines. Then there are fireworks. So many fireworks. So, so many fireworks. I am kneeling in the desert on a cold, still night, watching a lengthy fireworks display. And although these past several days have been a mixed bag, and although I am not sure I will feel motivated enough to put in the effort of being a return Burner… and although I have been seeing various smaller things burning all week, well… It’s not that the Man burns. It’s the inevitability of the Burn. What will you do in the lead-up to this? How will you decorate the simple experience of being born, living, and dying? You can’t control it all. Forces beyond your control can and will cancel your plans. Does that mean you will hide inside your tent for all of your life, dreading the potential of a dust storm? Of course not. Of course not. This year the Man actually has to be pulled down because he keeps standing for so long, flames at his base reaching up, bits of his arms and head and torso falling off on occasion but his frame remaining intact. I need to pee quite urgently when that is all done, and in my rush to find a porta-potty I lose Julian. I walk far away, find a porta-potty to pee in, head back to camp, quickly cook a self-cooking ready-made meal of emergency rations, and leave a note saying that I will either be here at the tent or at Center Camp or at the Planet Earth nightclub. He finds me in line for a coffee after I’ve been listening to a girl with a guitar playing on stage for a while. He was scared, he says, and waited at the same place for about an hour before giving up and finding his way back to the tent. I had no idea he would react that way. Unsure how I feel like our night should go, I lead us back to the tent. We rearrange the blankets and such a little bit, so that we’re not as cold as we were the previous night, and we snuggle up to each other to sleep. 31 Things are being pulled apart. Loaded into vans. A fair amount of the population of Black Rock City has already left. I go to write at Center Camp, leaving Julian to arrange his things a bit before he wanders about to try to secure a ride to Reno. (He has left a request on some sort of community board. No responses yet. ) He has also confirmed that there is no back up way for him to take the Burner Express out. I have slightly less food than I would prefer to have. I may sort of just need to live on trail mix today. “Want some water?” asks a man of about fifty, with a white beard, as I walk one of the back roads. “Uhh…” I consider this. “No, thank you! I should have enough water. ” “How about a small can of Perrier sparkling water, then?” “Oh, sure! That sounds tasty. ” “And here,” he says, also handing me a can of Dos Equis beer. “It’s not water, but it’s close to water. ” “I’ll try that, too,” I smile. I continue along to the playa info booth, to see if the shuttle to Gerlach and Empire runs today. As I suspected, it does not. Trail mix it is. Back to Center Camp. A guy is doing a storytelling show about working at Disneyland. I sit, dressed in a dust-covered black tee shirt, dust-covered black pants, dust-covered black socks, and dust-covered black leather shoes. After writing for a bit, I put my journal back into my bag and get ready to leave. “Excuse me,” says the woman who has sat across from me, on another one of the benches, while I was writing. “Do you have any chap stick?” “Let me check,” I say. “I don’t think so, but we’ll see. ” I’m ninety-five percent sure that I have no chap stick; ninety-nine percent sure that I have no chap stick that has not already been all over my lips. She made strong, casual, confident eye contact. She was beautiful, probably about my age, dressed modestly by Burning Man standards, in dark clothing caked with white. She looked familiar. “I like that we’re both sitting here, journaling,” she says. I see that she has a blank book, much like the one I am writing in now, open on her lap, resting on the long skirt she is wearing. She is journaling. And she uses the word “journaling”. And journaling is what I do. And she is not a child. She is my peer. She composes herself as an adult. The Man burned yesterday. I allow a piece of my present self to float from my eyes and land on her lips. Just a soul-kiss; nothing more. And the rest of me—the physical me, the me that can be seen by anyone in the vicinity—says, “Oh, yeah! You’re doing that, too! Nice! I like that we have our little journaling corner here. ” Then I pick up my bag and walk away from the woman I suddenly recognize as Carrie, who drunkenly one night years ago said to me, “I think we would be good together,” although all that happened was she took me to a dance where I met one of my best friends. My prior self, I think, fell in love with siblings I never had. The love that I let myself feel would develop with that kinship. It never, oh, dear, it just never worked out with the ones who stirred my insides. And while most of my present self walks back to the tent, that important part of me deepens the soul-kiss into a soul-hug. And then the woman, whatever her name was, maybe it was Carrie, walks away, and that piece of my soul—we’ll call that piece of my soul “you,” Reader—is conveyed along with her initially, yes, but still falls off before she leaves the Center Camp Cafe at Burning Man, in the middle of the Black Rock Desert, in Nevada, in the United States, in the year 2015, in who knows what permutation, in who knows what possibility. And later in the night, after the Temple has been burned—(did I not mention the Temple? Which would make just about anyone cry, with all the photographs and letters and memories of recently deceased loved ones people have left)—I will see someone at Center Camp look strangely at me, and I will think that they remind me of an even more minor character from my story, a basketball player, I think, and I believe she wore tinted contact lenses? But this detail won’t matter to me, because it is almost time to fall in love in the city of New York. For reasons of national security I am unable to tell you how I know, Reader, but after I move to New York City I am falling in love! 32 A musician called Sorne sits on the stage. He hits drum pads and manipulates loops while singing dark songs in a soaring voice. I sit, interested, drinking absinthe from single-glass plastic wine bottles, while behind me rich Silicon Valley douchebags say shitty things about women. So. This was Burning Man. 33 In the morning I’m checking in for the Burner Express bus, and it’s leaving sooner than I was expecting, and I’m leaving Julian with the tasks of getting the tent out of the ground and finding someone who’ll take it. Then I’m at the Reno Airport, where security panics as I leave a couple of my bags, then walk a bit, then walk back for the others. My cab driver this time is far from a Burner, complains about the dust, says he is surprised “they don’t have something there to blow the dust off people before you leave”. At a Motel 6 I shower, barely realizing I am sinking to the floor, washing my lower body at first but then just leaning against the shower wall during my first time washing myself in a week. Julian comes back, having managed to get a ride. We walk a couple of blocks to Denny’s. I get coffee. He gets a milkshake. I hug him goodbye. This cab driver is a bit older, so I lift my own bags.

Seeing patients. Filling out the Express Entry profile to enter the system for Canada’s immigration process. My score is lower than I thought it would be. I think I’ll have to re-take that test of my English, amazingly enough, because I didn’t test well enough. Busy work days Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. American Airlines again cancels my flight without stating a reason, within twelve hours of departure. I have to get on the Metro at 2 in the morning to get to the train station to board a train that leaves at 3:15 for New York. In New York at around 8:40 I take the 1 train uptown to the 168th Street station, stop at a restaurant and eat there, because I don’t want to rely on whatever the free food will be at today’s Narrative Medicine thing. 35 The Narrative Medicine classes are a delight. This weekend they’re held at the campus up at the 168th Street campus, where the med school classes are held. This weekend is technically part of the class that all new students need to take. There are different sections of the class on different days and at different times, but everyone does this introductory weekend together, listening to lectures all together in a large room and then splitting off into seminar groups that happen inside the small classrooms. My classmates are pretty friendly. More than usual I’ll find myself speaking up to break the silence before classes start. I’m realizing, bizarrely enough, that I have less to prove than many of my classmates. I am an actual health care practitioner. (A lot of my fellow students are still in medical school or are applying to medical schools. ) I have lots of experience with creative writing in an academic context. Add to this the fact that I am slightly older than a lot of them, too, and also the fact that I have given a lot of thought to the role narrative plays in people’s lives, and I am in the surreal position of feeling exceptionally prepared for a graduate program at Columbia University in the City of New York. 36 I’m staying at a bed and breakfast type place, but minus the breakfast, called the Harlem Flophouse. I have let the place know my estimated arrival time. When I have walked up the stairs to the brownstone and am standing at the door, I see a woman through the glass. She disappears for a moment, then comes back. “Sorry,” she says. “I saw you, but I was carrying some things. I had to set them down. ” She immediately starts showing me how to unlock the entry doors by punching buttons in the right combination. I’m not sure what’s happening. “I’m checking in,” I say. “I know. I’m checking you in. You’re Levi, right? This will be your key. I’m sorry. I’m stoned. ” Inside the creatively designed space, whose main floor living area has both a drum set and piano set up, she quickly clicks a few times at a desktop computer and says, “Oh, you have the garden room. ” She leads me downstairs to a room with a queen-sized canopy bed, an extra cot, a desk, a private bathroom, and a door which, as she shows me, leads out to a small garden area with a table, chairs, and a bench. “Just let the cat in and out if you hear him meowing,” I’m told. Above the desk in the room are Burning Man ticket stubs from various past years. 37 FROM: [Harlem flophouse owner] did you leave the Carnival of Mirrors burning man ticket behind at the 	harlem flophouse? 38 TO: [Harlem flophouse owner] It was still in my wallet. I saw the others. It amused me for a moment. So, yes, I did. :) 39 Work in Virginia, and more thesis class in Baltimore, and more days of work, and another Monday in New York for my classes at Columbia. It’s a nice campus. Bright students. I feel safe there. For two weeks in a row the 7:00 bus I bought a ticket to travel on actually leaves at 8:30. Another thesis class in Baltimore, and more work in Virginia, and a morning flight to Hartford so that I can make it to my cousin Chris’s wedding in western Massachusetts. 40 Then eventually I’m at Tom’s Restaurant, New York, New York. Angry at Gloria, one of the administrative people from my job in Virginia who had already proven herself eager to send me email written in a chiding tone, but who today called up to berate me for not setting as high an average frequency of patient visits as the company wants. She said this was “almost neglect”, which is a hell of a thing to say while it sounds like you’re trying to bully someone into Medicare waste. I just ate a quick turkey wrap and fries, and now I’m going to walk around for a bit and think about what to do with my work life next. 41 Port Authority Bus Terminal. I just grabbed myself some food at the Times Square McDonald’s, late into the night, and I was charmed by the experience: a security guard pulled back the orange cones to let me into the seating area after I got my food, and then I was in a world of loud music blasting through a quality sound system. This was after some time sitting and watching the performers at the Sidewalk Café open mic again, which was after a ride downtown on the 1, which was after some walking south on Broadway and thinking all the while and stopping at a Starbucks and staring at my 2016 planner and filling out paperwork that I’ve been carrying around with me (two things, specifically—the application for a New York state occupational therapy license and also the application for the Nova Scotia Demand stream of the Nova Scotia Provincial Nominee Program within the Citizenship and Immigration Canada Express Entry system for applying for permanent residency). Which was after the class at Columbia that is basically a philosophy class, which today was a discussion of Plato’s Symposium. Which was after my other class, which this week was discussing Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home. Which was after a bus ride from Hartford after being dropped off at the Hartford Union Station by Bruce on this Monday morning. Which was after a weekend spent in Massachusetts. And that weekend in Massachusetts? I arrived on Friday morning by plane—to my surprise and delight, the last of the American Airlines tickets I so regret purchasing this summer did prove valid for transportation at the time agreed upon. And that Friday I met with Salma at the Dirty Truth and discovered that holy shit, Ballast Point Brewing Company makes a habañero version of their famously great Sculpin IPA. Allison came by, too, which was lovely. The three of us went to the surprisingly empty Northampton Brewery, to their surprisingly empty roof, on this September night, when it was really pleasant to be outside. Then we were going to go to Hugo’s, but once she was at her car Salma’s back was bothering her so much (and she was tired anyway) that she decided to go home… …leaving me and Allison. Hugo’s was actually too crowded. So was Ye Olde Watering Hole. The Deuce wasn’t the environment we were going for, so we went back to Allison’s porch. I told her about Burning Man, which she didn’t know I had gone to. I finally get two of her zines. One of the two is an argument about Medea as a feminist figure. Allison drives me home. She turns off the ignition in the driveway of my mother’s home—not the house I grew up in (at Sunset and Dawn) but the one my mother and Bruce and I moved to in the year 2000. In the dark on a September night. I am thirty-four years old. Allison is thirty-one years old. And Allison is an only child, like me. And of course there will be the next day, when I see Salma again, and it will be another beautiful day, another one of those oh so very very very rare comfortable New England days. And I will go and eat with Salma at Riff’s Joint in the Eastworks building, just downstairs from Alice’s place, although I will not get in touch with Alice or mention to Salma that she lives here, because time is limited and I will feel like I want to catch up and Salma has been seeming really happy, not as beaten down and exhausted as some of the other mothers I have known in the months after their first birth. And Salma and I will walk briefly, her carrying little Elena in a baby sling of whatever variety, and breastfeeding. And then I will go from Easthampton to Northampton to meet up with Allison again, and she and I will end up at Hugo’s—much more quiet on this night—and she will talk to me more about my dating life. I will talk to her, as I have talked to her tonight, about wanting to find a way to communicate into the far reaches of the future, past the time of the angels. And when the other people at Hugo’s will all be finished watching the latest new episode of The Walking Dead they’ll step out and look at the lunar eclipse, and Allison and I will step out, too, and she’ll say, “Let’s go around here” and in the alleyway she’ll say, “Let’s do a mini-decode. Where are you in your narrative?” “About to fall in love. Probably once I’m full time in New York,” I’ll say. “Your narrative tells you that?” she’ll ask, literally raising an eyebrow, which is something I have never been able to do. “Maybe that’s not my narrative. I guess I know that through, yeah, other means. Man. Narrative is supposed to be my specialty. I don’t even think about decoding the essence anymore. When it was a trend I always just thought it was for everybody else. ” “Well,” she’ll say, “I’m on the run. That’s my narrative. I’m here in Massachusetts because I was running away from New York. So, what I should expect is that I’ll be haunted by people and situations that will feel dangerous to me. I’ll need to remember what’s really a danger and what just seems scary. And if I can accept the things that only seem scary, that’ll be the resolution to a coherent narrative, and I’ll move on. ” We’ll talk a little more about writing for the future. I’ll feel like she’s weary of all the future talk after a while, probably because it’s all so speculative and it seems there’s so little chance we’ll ever know for sure whether we’ve circumvented the fates, or whether we should even have been trying to do so in the first place. You are my love as I sit in Allison’s passenger seat. You are somewhere out there, Reader, but you continue to explore. Because you need to move. You need to never stop running. The other zine Allison has given me is about dating. “That’s not what I would consider my best work,” she has told me about that zine, adding, “I feel a little weird knowing that there are a couple hundred copies floating around out there. That’s the one people keep buying, for whatever reason. ” Returning to New York City, then, on the morning of the twenty-eighth day of September, after Bruce in his large vehicle gives me a ride so I can take the Greyhound from Hartford. Hi, Manhattan! And I am discussing Plato in an Ivy League classroom and purchasing coffee from street carts that put my coffee into brown disposable bags and the air quality in the city is much better than in previous decades and the crime rate is low and everyone is dancing except the ones who are sleeping in, on, and around cardboard in front of churches. From Tom’s Restaurant and Starbucks I go to the Sidewalk and then the Port Authority, which was after the class at Columbia that is basically a philosophy class. 42 A couple of visits for work. I’ve returned to my apartment in Arlington, Virginia with a note saying (as I knew was going to happen) how much I might owe for things like minor carpet stains, six broken door blinds [What? I used them about ten times total, and these are the only door blinds I’ve ever had that didn’t break] and for, most embarrassingly, the “odor”. (I didn’t take the trash out before I left for the weekend. ) But, anyway. I’ve been busy, and I’m glad about what I’ve been deciding I want to spend my time on in the upcoming months. I text my contact at Synergy Medical Staffing, the travel company that is technically my employer. I let them know that I would prefer not to renew the contract here in Virginia, after all. Then, I bring with me to my class in Baltimore copies of the I am a Jelly Doughnut excerpt I am submitting to the journal of thesis students’ works that gets put together every fall and spring semester. I am busy, busy, busy, overall. I have been having lots of patients thrown at me on this, a week that is already condensed because of my having been away for the weekend. After not quite getting around to it all week I finally dedicate some time on Sunday, October 4 to completing the application for an OT license in the state of New York. I already have paid, applied, and met most of the requirements for a Pennsylvania license—I previously thought that I would be working in Philadelphia next—but now I’m thinking of crashing in Chicopee for a couple of weeks or whatever, just going to New York for classes and as needed for apartment-seeking stuff, this November, after the end of my contracted work period (October 23) and my trip to California (October 28-November 2) and then Alaska (November 2-8). Then, I’m in New York again. I attend two classes. Then I take the 1 downtown, the L to Williamsburg, and among a lovely and very queer crowd I see a local songwriter I like, Mal Blum. The show doesn’t go very late at all, but I decide that inside Penn Station is as good a place as any to spend a few hours before the 3 AM train comes to take me south again. 43 I forget to write it down until more than a week later, but it’s important. To Allison I said, “I’m pretty good at not going down those roads of self-destructive thought patterns. I don’t make situations worse for myself. ” “It shows,” she said. “It always seems that way. ” “My anxiety comes up in certain situations,” I said. “And that happens a lot—like, on a daily basis for sure. But when the situation is over, I’m fine. ” 44 A couple of days later, Wednesday, I feel like I’m coming down with a cold or something. And I come home after work, collapse into that little bed-sized room. I wake up at I don’t know what time on Thursday morning, but feeling in terrible shape. Sick. Aching all over. I notify work. This might really be a problem. They’ve overburdened me with patients to evaluate this week as it is. The time passes bizarrely, as I lose track of how many times I nap, or what was a nap and what should qualify as a real sleep. Finally, on Friday morning, I drive down the street to the urgent care clinic. I wanted to do this yesterday, but it was all I could do just to sit up, most of the day. I don’t have a fever, so it’s not the flu. The physician’s assistant says it’s a virus, and he writes me a note that says I shouldn’t go back to work before Tuesday. Tissues all over an apartment already littered with notebook pages, printouts about how to format a fiction thesis, copies of pages of my personal information that I will give to the province of Nova Scotia once I have the dates-of-employment letters and Canadian-sized passport photos I need. It’s a miserable time. A miserable day. By the end of work hours on Friday I’ve been notified by my contact at Synergy Medical Staffing that the home health care company I’ve been working for wants to give the thirty day notice that they need to cancel their contract with me. I text back that I thought I only had two weeks left, anyway. (In other words, what I’m trying to say is: “They can’t fire me; I quit! But no, really: I quit earlier this week. Or was it last week? I don’t know. ”) I also ask for the letter I need with the dates of my employment. No response. And Monday will be the Columbus Day holiday (although, this year it is in the news that multiple jurisdictions are changing the holiday to Indigenous Peoples’ Day), so I suppose I can’t expect a response until at least Tuesday. A long weekend, long also in the sense that I’m going to be blowing snot into toilet paper and rolling around moaning. Trying to sit upright and focus long enough to catch up on all that paperwork I am behind on for work. Written responses submitted online by Friday at midnight for the philosophy course, and by Sunday at noon-ish for the other course. But mostly it’s typing information about patients: patient will benefit from skilled OT to teach compensatory strategies, develop an upper body strengthening home exercise program and zzz, sorry, but it’s time to sleep again, or maybe I’m awake again and lying on my back and checking my phone and Facebook is such shit, showing me the same posts and advertisements over and over, and what else is there to look at? I miss LiveJournal, always want to go back to it, but it has never been well-designed for mobile devices. I need to do dishes, while listening to Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go as an audiobook that I have downloaded to my phone. I must multi-task. Not a lot of discretionary time. In a few days maybe I’ll take an hour or so and write about these days. Maybe I will do it at a Starbucks on a day when I will forget that I am still recovering, when I will forget and wonder, Why am I so tired? And that will be Friday… oh, what is the date today, again? And Liberty Mutual, my car insurance company, keeps calling, because some kid backed up into my car, what, a few weeks ago? While he was I guess trying to back up to parallel park and I was just stopped in the lane behind him. And I forgot what to do in those situations but didn’t want to wait there for a cop to come, so I just took pics, including of the kid’s driver’s license, but I didn’t get the name of the insurance company. I called Liberty Mutual and they had me start a claim, but really what I want to do is figure out how to contact the kid and find out who his insurance company was. But that is such low priority. I’ve booked a moving van; I’ve reserved the elevator at my apartment complex. I’ll be getting the van for two days, no extra price, I guess because I booked it over a weekend. I’ll be driving it from Arlington to Chicopee, but then I’ll be dropping it off in the Bronx on a Monday morning before my classes. It looks like most of my things will be getting thrown into large, industrial-strength garbage bags, thrown over my shoulder, tossed into the moving van… which I’ve been calling a van, though it will actually be more of a truck. Even though I don’t have much stuff to move. I’ll be picking up Rosalyn’s things that day, too, and moving them to Chicopee. When I move to New York I’m thinking of staying at the 92nd Street Y and living away from New York when the summer comes. Friday, October 16: that’s the date today. I’m at Starbucks, Tysons Corner, Virginia, by the Greensboro Metro station. 45 I wasn’t hearing back from my usual contact at Synergy, and I needed confirmation about the status of my work contract (and I needed the letter with my employment dates to send to Canada), so I emailed a different contact at the company about it. This apparently was a problem for my usual contact, who wrote me an angry email about how I “complained” after only two days and how that was “not very professional”. 46 As I pull out of the parking lot of the Starbucks, having written my response to the angry email, I call Rosalyn. I raise the point that since I’ve been working in health care, I’ve basically averaged to make one new enemy every three months. “That’s normal, right?” I joke. “Not even remotely,” she says. “Like I’ve said before, I think you should just change your last name to Changeling. You get the most intense reactions out of people. ” The new, pretty-looking Metro station, with its pedestrian overcrossing, passes over me, and I pass under it. In this moment, looking up, I could be forgiven for feeling small or low. But instead, I just feel quick—because I am the one who moves, while the other is stuck in place. "

    "body": "47 Patients as far away as Woodstock and Front Royal. A man who has told me more than once that he hopes he dies soon, who is actually not all that old, and who doesn’t look very old, but has chronic pain and digestive problems. Another man, this one a little more frail, who actually gets up and does things on his own fairly well for me but then most of the time, when I’m not there, gets his daughter to do things for him. A woman my age, perhaps slightly younger, with a wild hairstyle, tells me I have beautiful eyes. She says to me, “It’s about quality of life. I may not have control over the quantity, but I can still do things to try to improve the quality. ” 48 Waking up at 2:30 in the morning on Monday. Sitting on the floor with my laptop, documenting, since I need to have all my visits documented, too, before the end of the business day on Friday, when I stop working this job, stop working in Virginia. It’s amazing how quickly the hours pass, and before I know it I’m rushing to catch the orange line to the red line to the Amtrak to Penn Station and then to follow the signs, walking underground, to the 1 uptown to 50th Street, where I get out and walk the three blocks to a place I scoped out online that looks like it’ll be able to take the Canadian passport sized photo I need to have taken of myself. And yes, there, across the street from Radio City Music Hall, I find the business, which shares a small space with a florist. The guy waves me over to the stool and asks me to wait. I wait about forty-five seconds. He takes the photo, then I stand around for about three minutes, then I pay the fee, then I wait around for another two minutes, take the envelope he gives me with the photos inside, put the envelope in my bag, step outside to where I am as usual the fastest pedestrian walking the streets of Manhattan. Back to the subway, taking thirty seconds to buy a pretzel from a street cart. Back to the 1. I ride in the first car—less busy there. I get a seat, sometimes have someone sitting right next next to me, sometimes do not. To Columbia University again. Wait. The midterm for one of my classes is due in two days? I’m really sorry. This isn’t like me. I won’t be able to get it finished in time. Back to Virginia. Everything I need for that Nova Scotia provincial nomination application, I have. But their response time, I see online, has been long. So, I’m going to register for another English test. A different one, this time: I think I’ll probably do better at a computerized test than sitting in a room with a guy at the front of the room barking at us all. I like the privacy of a cubicle, of retreating away from human interaction. If I get a slightly better score on that than I got on the other test, I should qualify to get a (more quickly processed?) nomination from Ontario, instead. I’ll move to whatever province will invite me away from the United States. I’m giving this my all. The time is now for this thing. There’s also Australia. They’re actually easier to relocate to than Canada. Australia would be preferable to staying here, for sure. I finish my work week, including all my documentation, and on Friday before 5 PM I drop off the iPad they gave me, plus all my signature sheets. I sleep, wake up before midnight, start cleaning and packing. I pack most of my things. Nap again. Waking up to my alarm. I walk to the car rental place, the one I went to a couple of times back when my car was being repaired after I hit that deer coming back from Frederick. I have to learn quickly how to reverse the truck into the dock at my apartment complex. The maintenance guy or whatever says the elevator is all set, that I just push and hold the button for the floor I want to go to and the door will stay open on that floor. I’ll be back on Tuesday, and I’ll be able to finish cleaning at that time, I think, hopefully, maybe, and I will squeeze the rest of my things into my car then. So, okay. I drive and it’s fine, although I have nothing to listen to except the radio. That’s a weird experience for me. I listen to the alternative rock station. Songs that were new when I was fifteen years old. I could not bear to be a person who just keeps reliving the same decade over and over. How is that pleasurable? Why is that so common? I stop for pizza in Gettysburg. A little before two o’clock, I’ve pulled into the driveway at my mom’s place. She got approved for disability benefits, she tells me, but she’ll stick around in Chicopee for another year. Then, she thinks, she might go stay with Brenda. I sleep with Kaylee. In the morning, no sooner have I drunk most of a crappy Keurig coffee than Bruce has come down, taken the keys, backed up my rental truck and lowered the ramp to the top of the front stairs. So, it’s time to load boxes and bags, I guess. Most of these things go downstairs, into the basement. Then I nap. Then I drive to Amherst to write my paper about Never Let Me Go in light of the little bit of Paul Ricouer’s writing we were assigned. 49 Ricoeur defines emplotment as “a synthesis of heterogeneous elements”. In his view, “the plot serves to make one story out of the multiple incidents or, if you prefer, transforms the many incidents into one story. ” Any given incident in a person’s life appears differently after it has been synthesized into his or her life story: a failed job interview might seem less tragic in light of later successes, while a high school sweetheart, considered in retrospect, might not look all that sweet. The story a culture tells about itself is also a synthesis. Perhaps the boldest thing about Ishiguro’s novel is not that it calls to mind the cliches of science fiction, but that it uses those clichés as a proxy for our own. It is, after all, easier for us as readers to see injustice when we are not directly implicated. In a globalized economy, for example, we all benefit from the labors of those who experience a lower standard of living than we do. Most of us do not do all we could to work against conditions of inequality in our day-to-day lives. But none of us has ever exploited a clone. 50 The instruction at Hailsham is thought of as a more moral way of raising clones—one that demonstrates the humanity and unseen potential of those children who are bred for the sole purpose of organ donation. Yet, even the school’s staff never equip their students with the ability to tell their own stories. The curriculum promotes a utilitarian idea of creativity—one that is narrow in its scope and primarily visual, so that the thought of poetry even being on the same level as painting feels absurd to the students. This “creativity” presumably bears a passing resemblance to art that is meaningful to the people outside of Hailsham’s campus, but it does nothing to bridge the gap between clones and non-clones when they have occasion to interact with each other. It is art that has been made after a prescription of life, rather than after an experience of it. Moreover, by failing to discuss in any substantial way exactly what awaits the clone children after they leave Hailsham, the guardians supply a false impression that the world is safer, more just, and more full of opportunity than it actually is. When a false impression like this persists for long enough, its impressions can never disappear completely: a lie lives on in the symbolism it has attributed. Because the context through which the children have created their self-understanding is built on lies of omission, their adult identities can only ultimately end up out of sync with the dire stakes of their lot. After years spent in a culture of compliance and conformity—one in which defiance appears to be the very height of foolishness—there is little chance that any of the students could conceive of fleeing their obligations, let alone mounting any sort of rebellion. Instead of a fence around the facilities, Hailsham has effectively built a fence around the students’ ability to perceive their own self-interest. However well-intentioned, and however less cruel than its alternatives, it is an institution leading its children calmly to their deaths. 51 I am clearly writing about more than just the world of Never Let Me Go in that paper. 52 I drive the Jetta to a new Starbucks that has opened up across from the Barnes and Noble in Hadley. I write some there. I wait at a stoplight next to one of the “Vermont State Troopers” prop cars for the movie Super Troopers 2, which is filming nearby. I write some more at the Applebee’s. Then I sleep next to Kaylee Puppy again. I write more of the essay. I shower. I drive to the Bronx. I’m running late, so I pay an insane amount of money to just drop off the truck instead of filling it up with gasoline, and I take an Uber to the Columbia campus. Discussing Toni Morrison’s Beloved in one class and Immanuel Kant in the other. I was planning to play at the Sidewalk Café for the first time tonight (again), but I have to finish writing that paper, so I sit at a coffee shop to write, then stop at a place called World of Beer, where I get some beer and finish the midterm and submit it via email. Then by bus to the Sidewalk. I watch. I love. I leave. My phone leads me in various directions—first, I think I’m going to catch a bus, then I think I’m walking, then I think I’m looking for one 24-hour diner, then I end up at a different 24-hour diner, at 4th Street and 6th Avenue. I get pancakes, because it has been far too long since I have eaten pancakes. I finish eating at about 3:30. My bus ticket is for a scheduled 5:00 departure on a Megabus to D. C. "

    "body": "53 Last Friday: My last day working in VA. Saturday: I packed up most of my things into a truck and drove them to MA, where I’ll technically be living during the month of November. Sunday: Unpacked those things, did Narrative Medicine coursework. Monday: Drove the rented truck to NY, where I dropped it off. Went to classes. More coursework. A late night open mic, a 24 hour diner. Tue: 5 AM bus to D. C. Slept on the bus, and 2-3 hours more on my floor of my now mostly empty apartment. Drove to Baltimore for my thesis course for Johns Hopkins. Sat in the car reading aloud one of my stories to time how long it would take during that night’s practice for the thesis reading. Went to class. Drove back to VA to clean and pack the last of my things into my car. Slept one hour. This morning: Dropped off my car at a pre-arranged spot in Columbia, MD. Took a taxi to a bus that broke down. Was about to split the fare for another taxi with a very talkative woman when a replacement bus came. Got to BWI on time to take the Amtrak to D. C. so I can then Metro to DCA, which is where I’m actually flying to Orange County from. This is how one vacations, yes? 54 A Southwest Airlines flight, stopping in Dallas. I and the other passengers continuing on to Orange County simply stay on the plane and wait for it to depart again. This is yet another thing that Southwest does differently from other airlines; it’s nothing I have seen before. Then we’re landed at John Wayne Airport, Santa Ana, California. I turn on my phone. Rosalyn has messaged to request that I meet her outside the International House of Pancakes across the street from the airport. Okay, then. I’ve left airports by car, taxi, or rail before, but never just on foot. I have to ask someone how to get out to the street. He points his finger and tells me that I have to walk through the parking garage, that there’s a door there. It is a nice, clear, still night. A comfortable temperature. Everything is lit directly. Everything is lit ambiently. Light pollution from all sides. Palm trees. Not an actual movie set, but a movie set nonetheless. I push the button to walk. I wait for the little white light in the shape of a human, and the beep-beep sounds, and then I cross the street. Cross the street again. Walk some more. Rosalyn is standing in front of the IHOP. I’m not in the mood for eating there, so we go to the Mexican food place across the street. It’s a little bit dark. Mostly empty. The waitress is friendly to us. I am starting to grow a beard. After we have eaten, she walks me to her school—Stanbridge College, which I found out about and encouraged her to apply to last year. The campus was obviously just a business park before the college bought it. She takes me to the student lounge area, from which she had regularly chatted with me on the phone back when she was still living in her trailer, before she had to move out and stay with her friend Lisa and her conservative Korean parents. Then we’re back in that BMW she bought from her father for 10k, which she was still paying him for in installments when we first met. I have her purse by my feet; her TomTom GPS in my hand. I have already made a reservation for us, at the Ramada in Costa Mesa. I punch in the address and there we are, and I tell Rosalyn that it has been crazy, that I haven’t slept on a mattress for more than a total of like three hours in the past four days or something crazy like that. And zzz oh I guess we have slept and woken up already. I have a big day of entertainment planned for us in Los Angeles. I haven’t told Rosalyn what to expect. She is being brave by city driving. She would never drive in L. A. on her own, and even with me there it is quite a big deal for her, putting her on edge. First on our agenda is a taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live. It’s the Halloween episode. Harrison Ford is on, in a hot dog costume, discussing the plane crash he survived and the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Later, Rosalyn and I keep coming back to a discussion of all that seemed odd in his posture and behaviors, and how as therapists we both felt like we wanted to treat him. Then to Largo, where tonight it’s Judd Apatow and Friends. After we park, we check in. (I like that system: we’re given our seat numbers and wristbands and then are free to walk away and come back at any time before the show begins. ) We go down the street and find a Thai restaurant. We eat. Rosalyn wants to run inside the Trader Joe’s to grab a bunch of a particular kind of chocolate bar, so we do that. I accidentally lead us on foot a couple of blocks in the wrong direction, past Cedars-Sinai Hospital, but we make it back to Largo in time to use the restrooms and grab our seats (third row, center). Judd Apatow (who is known for being a big-time comedy producer/writer/director, but who also lately has been doing stand-up) is preparing for a show at Carnegie Hall, which will be a landmark gig for him. He does some material, then Natasha Leggero does a short set—a good deal of it about her being recently married and going to Burning Man with her husband, Moshe Kasher. Apatow then does another chunk of material before introducing special guest Adam Sandler. The two of them chat on stage for a bit, then Sandler (with an accompanying keyboardist) tries out a bunch of songs on guitar. Enjoying him requires one to accept that he is Adam Sandler and that he will therefore not be the most highbrow entertainment in town, but he’s good, and the songs about being a father work better with his style of comedy than I would have expected. I only wish that I could go back to middle school and cash in the coolness points that I would have earned from having been fifteen feet away from Adam Sandler. I next take us to the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre—Franklin, in case they’ll let us in to the last show of the night that is going on there. But we’re told it’s already the second half, close to finished, so instead I lead us into a bar down the street. I get red wine; Rosalyn gets a Shirley Temple; we each get a second round, then, as we sit outside at a table. Our hotel for the night is the Tangerine Hotel in Burbank. It’s a neat place, but I don’t remember why I thought it was worth paying so much more than a slightly less stylish place in a slightly more distant neighborhood would have cost. Probably I was worried about drive times. The next day, I use my phone to locate a Men’s Wearhouse in Santa Monica, because I want nice clothes, since I am hanging out in New York at a fancy college. We find the place, get some nice clothes measured for me, arrange for them to be tailored and shipped to the store location in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Renee pays (!) with money that she has inherited after her mother’s death. Then a drive up the Pacific Coast Highway to Ventura, where Rosalyn lived for a year as a child. We find the house that she lived in with her mother, her father, and her brother. The expectation had been that the family would stay there for good… Rosalyn had really liked it here, wanted to stay, was sad when circumstances made it so that the family had to move back to Maryland. Ventura is more likable than I was expecting. We walk through thrift stores, grab a coffee. It’s the night before Halloween, and the place Rosalyn leads me into because she wants to look at a few things is full of people actually taking advantage of the “FREE CORSET FITTING” advertised on the sandwich board in front. I really dig the aesthetic of the place, I realize, as everything I look at I appreciate after a few seconds, even though based on the storefront I would have just thought, “Eh, it’s some witchy, new age store, no big deal” and kept walking. Rosalyn and I compare our tastes in long skirts. She finds and purchases a replacement for what I now have her referring to as an arm sock, although there is a more apt term for it. (It’s a thing she wears to protect her fair skin from the southern California sun—not just something worn because she likes it, as it was years ago for Maurice. ) We watch online the episode of Kimmel we saw taped. Another night in a hotel… but I don’t mind it at all. In the morning we return to the Goodwill Store we stopped at the previous night. This is because I noticed a sign advertising the daily special, which was fifty cents for all CDs and books. I grab several, and so does Rosalyn. Once we’re in the car and driving we notice that two of the CDs I got are only cases, with the discs missing, but oh, well. It’s Halloween. Many months ago, from a Chili’s Restaurant in Philadelphia, I reserved a spot at a campground in Big Sur… but with so much else going on, after finding that the tent I took back from Burning Man would not be functional, I never got around to discussing the matter with Rosalyn to figure out what we could use for camping gear instead. We have therefore decided to forfeit the thirty-five bucks or whatever it is I paid for the reservation. But we don’t really know what we’ll be doing in place of camping, except that it will involve us traveling south from Ventura. We stop at Venice Beach—walking and grabbing some food and then returning the car. I find it sort of fun, but Rosalyn finds it repugnant. After that, what we do is about the same as what we might have done on an average weekend back when we were living together in Massachusetts. In Marina Del Rey we see a movie—Rock the Kasbah—which despite Bill Murray’s starring role is bad enough that we do not discuss it at all. Then we take our laptops out at a coffee place. I call to finally cancel my cable Internet subscription back in Virginia, and to cancel my old Android cell phone with the Massachusetts telephone number (which I have since replaced with an iPhone that has a New York number). Just before we get to our hotel room—the Comfort Inn in Hawthorne—Rosalyn spots a chihuahua in a crosswalk, crossing at a busy intersection. Soon we are out of the car, in a McDonald’s parking lot, with Rosalyn throwing pieces of fancy cheese she happens to have on hand, trying to keep the dog away from places where she would be likely to get run over. “Would you be willing to call the animal rescue while I keep her distracted?” she asks me. I do, but the police officer I’m connected with says there’s no animal rescue person working tonight and that it is an overall busy night for the officers on duty and that he would not want us to stay and wait when someone might not ever find the time to come by and check out the situation. So we frown as the collar-less, tag-less dog continues to walk away from us along the sidewalk. 55 In the morning I locate a decent-enough-looking breakfast spot in Manhattan Beach. The location is a combination of crowded sidewalks, overpriced shopping, and sun-worshipping exposed skin that many of the friends I have had over the years would find horrifically repulsive but which I think is pretty all right, charming in its foreignness, especially once Rosalyn and I make it down to the water, walk out onto the pier, and watch the surfers: “It looks like the better waves are on this side. ” “Oh, he rode that crest for a while!” “I can see how it would be meditative, not boring, because you’re always watching the waves, because you never know when the next good wave might come along. ” Then to see another movie—Steve Jobs this time—at one of the cinemas along Santa Monica’s 3rd Street promenade. This is a better movie than the one we saw yesterday, although I’m retreating into myself from a lack of alone time and although Rosalyn—presumably due to some combination of continuing mourning over the death of her mother, stress from school, and fear of driving in unfamiliar places—is still acting anxious, talking quickly and listening poorly, smiling rarely. After the movie we eat at Johnny Rocket’s, because the sign advertising malts was calling out to Rosalyn. Then we go to the Westside Comedy Club, where we get to be two in an audience of like ten people for a night of comics once again working out material. This time it’s Neal Brennan (co-creator of Chappelle’s Show) and Friends. Other than Brennan, the one guy I remember having heard of is Greg Fitzsimmons. But everyone’s pretty good. At Rosalyn’s request our hotel for the night is just down the street from her school, so we’ll be able to do breakfast in the morning and won’t need to rush. In the morning, at the IHOP, I have my planner open on the table, so that I can be sure I know all her plans for travel to the east coast for the next several months. (She’ll be flying to D. C. for the holidays, then to New England in late January to visit me and Chris. ) (My planner already looks old and worn, even though it says “2016” on its cover. ) 56 Stanbridge is a little too crowded for my tastes, for such a small space. So, when Rosalyn is going to class, I tell her I’ll be wandering off to find somewhere else to work on whatever business I’ll be working on. So, a Starbucks. Then a Peet’s. Then the airport. Mostly I spend my time figuring out hotels and hostels for the next couple of months—in Fairbanks, in Anchorage, in New York City—and figuring out things like when I’ll drive that carful of my things up from Maryland, and how I will later get a different carful of things—Rosalyn’s things—from there to Massachusetts. And on a Southwest flight from Santa Ana to Seattle I once again have a row all to myself. Actually, I am several rows away from the next passenger, not counting the flight attendants who occasionally sit across from me. I write about myself and my experiences in a black book of papers glued to hard binding. I wonder if this will all one day be known as a novel. Then, from Seattle, an Alaska Airlines flight. Amazing but true: once again there is no one sitting next to me. Although, there is someone in the aisle seat of this, the back row. A man. But I am not paying attention to him. I am looking out the window. No headphones. No anything. Just three hours and forty-five minutes looking out the window—although, mostly through the dark I can’t tell what is clouds and what is snowy wilderness. It’s just blurs. "

    "body": "57 Nov. 3, 2015. Fairbanks, Alaska. State number fifty. “Taxi?” A man with a ponytail gets out of his cab. “Yeah,” I say. My breath is visible. There is snow on the ground. He sees that I don’t need help with my luggage; I only have one backpack and one tote bag. “Super 8 Motel,” I tell him. Then I’m home—by which I mean alone in a rented room in a place I have never been before. I take off my coat, my hoodie. I take off another layer below that, too, after a brief battle against static electricity. Sitting on the bed of room 127 I plan what I will say to my classmate at Columbia University, Rosalie, whom I have arranged to call at 4 AM Alaska time (8 AM her time, and the most convenient of the times when she said she would be available to take a call. ) I actually nap for ten minutes before calling her and elaborating on our plans to co-lead a discussion next Monday in New York City on Toni Morrison’s Beloved. 58 I don’t really like the lady who waits on me at the northernmost Denny’s in the world. And there’s not really time to take the bus to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (whose MFA program I once applied to), because I wouldn’t get to spend much time there before the bus stops running. And… what? It’s dark already? Quiet. Everything is quiet. That is what I didn’t know I was in for: so much silence in Alaska. Big, aggressive silence. I walk into the cinemas. Nothing good playing. I walk into an indoor shopping center. Like the airport and my motel, it appears to have been built at the exact same time as my earliest childhood memories. Brown wood in weird places. Dull, solid colors that were probably selected so that they would not be drastically altered by years of tobacco smoke, back when indoor smoking was ubiquitous. (The airport in Honolulu was like this too, I remember. ) I spend a long time in the liquor store, trying to decide between beer and wine, but in the end I choose nothing. I walk back along Airport Road, over snow. Not a lot of it—maybe four inches where it isn’t plowed. Most surfaces, sidewalk included, look like they were cleared of snow after an initial snowfall, then were covered up by another half inch or so, which no one thought was worth responding to. In my hotel room I finish a brief assignment for one of my classes. Then I go across the street to an Asian fusion restaurant that turns out to have some of the worst meat I have ever eaten in my life, although the noodles and sauce are fine and the people who work there seem nice. Snow comes down lightly outside, but only for a brief time. 59 Then I’m in a cab again. Another old, beaten up car. There is a giant crack across the entire width of the windshield. It really does look precarious. The driver says nothing about it. She asks me what I’m doing in Fairbanks, though, just as the last driver did. Also just as he did, she falls silent when I say that I’ve been on the move between D. C. , Massachusetts, and New York City. On the topic of Anchorage she has more to say, though: “I don’t mean to scare you, but it’s much bigger there. It’s like a Chicago or someplace like that. I’m not trying to scare you, but it’s a lot different from Fairbanks. ” 60 Then I’m at the Ted Stevens International Airport. I take the People Mover to the edge of what is known as Midtown Anchorage. The sky is dark, but it’s not late. “Oh, Arlington, Virginia!” says the guy at the midtown location of the Bent Prop Inn and Hostel when I arrive to check in for the night. “I lived for many years in…” and then he names a locality. He gets my key out, steps out from behind the counter in the office area, then tells me to follow him. “Are you planning to go out anywhere tonight?” he asks me. “Oh, I don’t know,” I reply. “I might do some Googling on my phone and see what’s around, once I’m in my room. ” “Well, the other guy knows what’s around really well. He works up on the North Slope. He comes back here and stays for a while every so often. ” When we enter the room—which is actually a full one-bedroom apartment, really, but with two bunk beds in the bedroom—the guy he is talking about is stretched out on the couch, simultaneously blasting Family Guy on the television and also playing assorted videos on his tablet. He never talks to me. “I’ll have to get you a towel,” says the innkeeper. He never does. After some time Googling, I talk myself out of walking to any of the bars I have found information on. Instead I walk about a half mile to where Google Maps shows me there are a couple of different chain restaurants. At the Outback Steakhouse I am seated across from a birthday party, a family event. Maybe eight to twelve people. Children getting up, running in one direction, turning, then running in the other direction. Adults raising their voices in contests to see who can be the most conspicuously, vacuously innocuous. And so many pictures, with flashes going off in many directions, that I could have thought myself on the red carpet at the Academy Awards or something. The waitress’s name is Daisy. She quite impressively manages to make me remember this fact so that I will fill out a survey and compliment her in exchange for a discount in my check. It helps that she sits down across from me in my booth while she takes the order. I eat some food, drink some coffee, and maybe I have a lone beer as well, as then I’m back outside, in a temperature that is about thirty degrees, with my hands in the pockets of my long coat, with a hoodie under the coat, wearing no hat. (I don’t like messing up my hair, and I have a hard time not losing hats, anyway. ) I cross the street and step into a movie theater that feels a little differently set up, a little older, with slightly weirder patrons than most cinemas I have been to. I see the movie Goosebumps, based on the scary books for young readers by author R. L. Stine, starring Jack Black as a fantastical version of that author. Then it is the morning, and I am checking out of the hotel. “Where are you going next?” asks the guy. “Somewhere else,” I rudely reply, having not had coffee yet. Daisy didn’t trouble me with small talk. 61 Then I’m walking to the downtown. The weather is still not too bad, and the walk is only, like, a couple of miles. I find the hotel I booked a reservation at. It wasn’t the place that I meant to book a reservation at; my brain got confused at the multiple browser tabs open on my laptop while I sipped on a Pike Place Roast with a splash of soy milk at the Barnes and Noble I stopped at along the way. It’s a tiny room. To heat it I need to plug in a space heater that has no thermostat, only “low”, “medium”, and “high” levels of heat. After I start scattering the contents of my red McDonald’s tote bag and standard black backpack onto the carpeting of what walking space there is between the bed, the door, the entrance to the bathroom, and the gigantic flatscreen television (I guess pretty much all televisions have been flat screen for some time now, haven’t they?) I go to brush my teeth and discover that there is no running water. “I have no running water,” I say to the woman in the office. “Oh! I’m sorry. I forgot to tell you. They’re fixing something in the plumbing. It should be back up within fifteen minutes. ” And it is. And I nap. And I awake. It is pressing that I should get to work on the midterm for the philosophy class, but I have also been doing things like applying to live in student dorms at the 92nd Street Y in New York City starting in January and making sure my bills are paid, and I wake up in the dark and walk the downtown, looking for a place to eat. I can’t get work done at the place where I eat a burger, so I move on to a place called the Glacier Alehouse, or something like that… but it’s packed full of people and so I don’t even try to sit down there. Instead I walk across the street to the empty bar and restaurant at some hotel. When I place my order, the waitress gives me an expression of disbelief. “You want a beer and a coffee and nothing else?” but then she seems to worry that she said this too sharply: “I think I’ve probably done that myself at some point, too. ” And although it is like pulling teeth, I get two-thirds of a page written about Descartes. Two-thirds of a page is better than nothing. I’m woken up at five in the morning by an earthquake that Twitter tells me was a 4. 7. I eventually get back to sleep but am still not feeling great when I check out and walk to the indoor mall. I need to get my iPad fixed; I dropped it before I could get around to buying a protective case for it. I go to the Apple Store, make an appointment. Walk down the street to one place, but it’s clear I wouldn’t be able to focus on paper-writing there. I sit at some pizza place that is mostly empty instead. The woman who processes the replacement of my iPad is nice, but then I’m waiting for someone else to help me set it up and that message doesn’t get communicated and as the tablet starts up the prompts are in Spanish. I’m reminded that my Spanish language comprehension is close to non-existent. The man I then talk to—I think he was the one who was supposed to come and help me—isn’t helpful. I ask him if there are any cases available I could buy, and he says, “Yeah, over on that wall” and so I get up and stand there until someone else helps me. After this I walk down the street to the Enterprise Rent-a-Car. “Oh, Virginia. I used to live in…” and then the guy helping me names a locality. 62 Then I’m in an eleventh floor hotel room, listening to streaming music through my iPhone through ear buds, swaying with the room lights off, looking out over nighttime Anchorage. Inlet Tower, the hotel is called. I like this place. I drive and get Mexican food for a meal. Write a bunch of my midterm paper. Get pizza delivered. Write more. Sway in the darkness some more. Sleep. 63 Then I am deciding not to eat at one place—a dark, crowded-together place full of locals in white beards and flannel shirts—because this is another location that would not be conducive for paper-writing. Also, they might kill me. So, I end up at Denny’s, and go to drop off the car. Aw, man. I’m leaving Alaska. I’ve done nothing, basically, but I’m liking Anchorage. But the branch I made reservations to drop my car off at—a different one, not the one I picked the car up at—is closed, closed hours before my reservation said I was to drop off the car. So I sit in the parking lot, think it through, and decide that that’s the business’s error and it is now all the same to them if I keep the car until the evening: they will find the keys in the box at the same time the next morning either way. My flight is not until like 2 AM. I get another room at Inlet Tower, nap, write a bunch more of that paper, then drop the car off in earnest and call to get picked up by a taxi. I fly and sleep and fly. I was hoping, because it was so clear, so beautiful, the mountains so amazing, that maybe some aurora borealis would be visible. I switched seats so that I would be on the left side of the plane, so that, I thought, I would be facing in a direction closer to north for more of the flight, so maybe I would be able to see some pretty colors in the sky, but… my window seat had no window. I didn’t know that was a possibility! I thought all the aisles on all commercial airplanes had windows. It’s six something in the morning when I land in Seattle. I gave myself time here so that I wouldn’t have to spend like ten hours straight on planes, and because I had a thought that maybe I would want to take a bus from Seatac to the city or something, go for a walk and recall how long it has been since I lived in Washington state. But what happens is that I sleep in a chair in the airport as the sun rises. Tall glass windows are all, like, Hey. I’m fucking impressive, right?! And I’m like, Yeah, man. Yeah, man. You’re impressive. Zzz gotta write a zzz paper and eat a stromboli. "

    "body": "64 Laguardia to the M80 bus. Standing with my bags, leaning into the turns like a skateboarder. About midnight, Sunday becoming Monday, heading into Manhattan, south until Broadway and 106th, where I get off and grab a slice of pizza, walk and eat it, walk to the Broadway Hotel and Hostel at 101st Street. I go up in a tiny little elevator straight out of the year 1955 up to the seventh floor. A shirtless guy named Giovanni wakes up when I use the key to open the door. I sit in the common area for a bit, chat online with Rosalyn, plan when to wake up in the morning. Wake up in the morning. I’m able to have the people at the hostel hold my tote bag of clothes behind the counter. I go eat at some little diner, which is not crowded at all. I go to the Butler Library at Columbia—a good place to get paper-writing done, unlike anywhere in the city of Anchorage. I finish the midterm and email it. I realize that I left my copy of Beloved in the wrong bag, the one being kept behind the counter at the hostel. I don’t really have the time to go back and get it, so I talk to someone at the library’s circulation desk to try to find a copy that I might check out. This person shows me how to use the catalog search on one of the computers, then shows me the door to the stacks. Despite going where I think the call letters have told me to go I find no copy of Beloved and so end up buying a new copy from the bookstore, mostly just so that I don’t look like a fool while I and my much better prepared classmate, Rosalie, lead the class in a discussion and exercise related to the book. That class goes fine. The philosophy class is as usual pretty much just conversation. I think I’m going to get my guitar from storage so that I can play some songs at the Sidewalk, but then I remember that Marina and the Diamonds is playing at Terminal 5 and the show sold out the day tickets went on sale, but maybe? And I see that on StubHub—the largest ticket reselling web site these days—I can get a single ticket to this $40 show for only $17. I go back to the hostel, ask if they’ll hold my other bag, too, until later in the night. They agree, which actually sort of surprises me. I go to the show. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go—I was going to so many shows in D. C. and Baltimore, and maybe it would be better to focus on my own endeavors instead of spending so much time as an audience member now that I’m on my way to living in New York. But I look around at the kids—all the girls looking for examples of confident womanhood, all the gay boys looking for a safe space in which to have fun—and it’s just like, yay for humans getting together like this. Y’know? And a diner to hang out in, then sitting on the floor in the always sad Port Authority Greyhound waiting area for a bus departing at 3:45 in the morning and arriving at 9:05 in Washington. But I actually get off at the Baltimore stop instead. I walk, then, carrying the same backpack and tote bag that I brought with me to California and Alaska, through the gray morning rain. I hide under the awning in front of a hotel, checking the map on my phone, making sure I’m walking in the right direction to get from the bus station to the light rail station that’s next to the stadium. Encountering no one, I climb up and down an absurd set of concrete stairs, then walk a quarter of the way around the stadium’s circumference, then cross a bridge, remember how to get a ticket for Baltimore’s light rail, and rush to board the train that has arrived. I ride this to BWI. How many airports have I been inside these past two weeks? I get a cup of soup and a sandwich from the Subway. I wait for a bus, this one another hour’s ride, to the Mall in Columbia. At the mall, the next bus is already waiting. This one takes me to the hospital where Rosalyn was born. I call a cab, which picks me up within about five minutes and takes me to my white Chevy Cruze, parked in front of the house Rosalyn grew up in, on a cul de sac. My hope is to drive all the way to Massachusetts, but I’m starting to poop out already by the time I’ve left the state of Maryland. I pull off in the parking lot of a gas station, use my phone to find a good deal on a hotel next to the Philly airport, check in there, and sleep. I wake up in the evening, use the time to take care of various types of business (such as planning more crazy transit logistics), and also I drive to the nearest Wawa twice, because Wawas are the best convenience stores anywhere. I check out early in the morning and drive to the Burlington Coat Factory in Pennsauken, New Jersey. This seems like the most reasonable way to buy a professional outfit that I can wear to my “clinical witnessing”, which is planned to be between 1 and 3 in the afternoon today in New York. I buy a jacket, pants, shirt, socks, and shoes. I do the clinical witnessing thing. Back to Chicopee, then the next day a drive to Alix’s place in Watertown. “When did you move in here?” I ask once we’re inside. Her place is rather empty and unfurnished. “About two weeks ago,” she says. “Before that we had a temporary place we found on AirBnB, because the apartment we tried moving into before that was no good. ” Alix and I climb a narrow spiral staircase from the basement level to the first floor. Most of the dumb things that are supposed to happen to a person when they are no longer in their twenties have not really happened to me. I still spend late nights out quite enthusiastically. I do not think I have really become set in my ways. What I do feel sad about, though, is that the time I get to spend with people I haven’t seen in a while feels insanely brief in almost all cases. There is always another errand to run, a pre-existing plan that cannot be backed out on, or a bedtime to attend to, or something. I convince Alix to at least come with me down the street to her neighborhood Starbucks, though. She is one of those people who can drink coffee at any hour without it impairing her sleep. She leads me outside to the edge of the parking lot. “I’ll take you to where I always sit on the parking curb thing,” she says. “I used to look at this building and think it would be a great place to live in, until I saw rats running inside, like, on a bunch of different nights. Huge rats, too. Gigantic, sewer-type rats. ” “Where do the rats run into the house?” I ask. I still sometimes find myself wondering if she’s exaggerating or making things up, even—no, especially—about trivial things like this. “I don’t know,” she says. “They get in somehow. ” I nod. The night is a New England autumn, mostly clear, with a visible moon and fast-moving clouds high above us. The kind of night that I remember from childhood Halloweens. She says, “I keep thinking about your life now and comparing it to how you were before. When you would just keep saying, ‘How am I going to survive! I don’t know how I’m going to survive!’ pretty much every day. ” I laugh. “I’m glad you remember that,” I say. She continues. “And I’d just be, meanwhile, working at that fucking pizza place, worried that my psychotic ex-boyfriend was about to come after me, and I was like, ‘I dunno, Levi. You’ve just gotta do it. You survive today, and then you survive tomorrow, and you keep doing that. ” “I think there’s probably something to be said for both our methods,” I say. “There’s something to be said for your way of just, like, just fucking doing it. And there’s something to be said for me spending time every day worrying and staring at the Internet, researching, until I can come up with a plan. ” She asks me, “Did you ever meet my friend Isaiah?” “No,” I say. I definitely remember hearing about him, how he lived in Massachusetts at one time long ago but then moved back Los Angeles, where he was originally from. “He used to always remind me. He’d ask, ‘What do you think the odds are that you’d be alive today if you had lived the life you did, but on the streets of, like, Compton, or the Bronx, or… somewhere that wasn’t Northampton, the little college town where I could sleep in the park and not be disturbed. And the answer is, none. I couldn’t have made the choices I made and ended up all right. ” “And now,” I say, “You’re doing great. I’m so excited for you, with this job, and moving out here. We’re both doing so well, and I don’t think anyone was actually expecting it from either of us. But I think there’s a value to that perspective, like what you were saying. Being able to see both what you had and what you didn’t have. I mean, that’s a skill. You can really use that. And I think it helps people to succeed. Like, it’s really useful. If you make it out of the trenches and can bring that awareness into, like, a career. And…” A rat. “…there’s a rat running into that house,” I say. “Was it huge?” Said casual and deadpan, like so much of what she says, in between puffs of her Marlboro Light. “It was pretty big rat, yeah. ” “See? I wasn’t lying. ” “No. You weren’t. ” 65 I stay up all night at Alix’s place, doing homework, being my own personal assistant, watching a music video here and there, feeling pretty celebratory in fact, and I drive all the way to Jamaica Plain to get pad thai from the Wok n’ Talk, and I get an egg thrown onto my car’s windshield from an overpass as I’m driving back, and in the morning on top of Alix’s mattress—(not under the blanket, because I tried that and was quite comfortable until I noticed the extensive menstrual stains)—I’m scrolling again and again through Facebook posts and even Metafilter and eventually Reddit. I hear Alix getting up before I’m asleep. But eventually I’m asleep. Then it’s the next day, and I pick Alix up around Fenway. I drive with her to the Prudential Center, where she buys some makeup at an impressively efficient Sephora store, and we get some food at the Panera Bread, and then it’s time for us to part ways, her to be picked up by Peter and me to take the Pearson Test of English or whatever it’s called, at a testing center there in Boston. This test will not help me to get into Canada, but it will help me to do the same in Australia, if I end up going that route. Then I drive to a hotel South Burlington, Vermont. 66 I get up. I check out of the hotel room, but I leave my car in the parking lot. I leave my car there because I have realized something: I still have a bunch of boxes of my possessions from the apartment in Arlington, stacked up in the back seat and trunk of my car, and a border crossing might well be complicated by this fact. A one-day car rental off-season in Vermont is not an expensive proposition, relatively speaking, so I’ve planned to walk the couple of blocks to the Enterprise car rental place, just in time for my first-thing-after-they-open-at-9-AM advance booking. And so that happens, and I drive into the province of Quebec, and I stop for coffee once I am in Montreal, but my debit card does not work when the woman at the counter tries to run it. I cross the street, grab Canadian dollars at a TD Bank ATM, then go back and get the coffee. Where I parked the rental car is two hour parking only, and that won’t do because I have a three-hour-long English exam to take, but I look down the block and there is a parking lot. I think at first that my parking is only going to cost five dollars, but that’s only with validation from certain shops. I have to pay ten. Right on time, then, I enter the building that is, like, part of one of those colleges you might not know the name of even if you walked past it every day. I demonstrate quite well, I think, to the computerized test that I am proficient in English. I walk rue Sainte-Catherine and that area for like twenty minutes, grab a slice of pizza, throw the paper plate in the trash, walk the sidewalk eating it. But then I have to be going, because it’s a long drive back to drop off the rental car in Burlington, and then another long drive in my own car back down to Chicopee. 67 I go to the UMass library because I hope I can borrow a copy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception, which I’m supposed to be reading. But the library catalog shows it as “on hold”, so it’s a wasted drive. In the morning I drive to New York. Awesomely, I have found parking up by Waterfront Park, around 125th Street, for the duration of my classes (12-6 PM) for just about twelve bucks by paying online. After class I make the drive to a hotel in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, while sipping on some green tea from a place I walked by on the way back to my car from the Columbia campus. My throat has that slight tickle that often is prologue to an illness, although it would seem bizarre to think I could be getting sick again after so short a time. Once again I sleep early. I wake up at an hour when many are going to bed and I run to a Wawa. I try to get some work done, then sleep again, then wake up at a normal person time. In the morning I hand my key card to the guy downstairs to check out. I think about North Wales and how driving past where I used to live there would only add like a half hour to my day but no, this will be the time when I pass through this part of Pennsylvania and do not stop to peek at the building next to the train station, the building where Arden took me in. I have nothing to gain from doing that anymore. I drive to Columbia, Maryland, to Mary’s house, because I have arranged to have her leave out on her porch Rosalyn’s possessions, which originally I was supposed to have driven up to Massachusetts in that truck I rented and drove from Virginia. (The last of my possessions I just unloaded from my car last night, piling them mostly in the room in Chicopee where I’ve been sleeping when I’m there. ) Rosalyn’s things are easy to lift and easy to fit into my vehicle. I text her and Mary both to communicate the fact that I have been successful in doing this. As I pull out of Mary’s driveway, who do I find waiting there in a car at the end of it but Mary herself! But I only see that it’s her as I’m accelerating away. And Rosalyn is calling. “Hello?” I try to say, but my voice is the hoarsest I have ever heard it in my life. She is just calling to say thank you and to chat, but I am finding that my voice keeps cutting out when I try to use it. She and I end our conversation quickly. I pull off the highway. I was originally going to drive to Baltimore to finish formatting on my thesis and print it and leave it for the review committee, but now I’m just worried about my voice. I do my best to give my information over the phone to a woman at my insurance company. (My insurance is the Columbia University student plan now. ) She eventually gives me the address of an in-network urgent care place in Columbia, Maryland. At the urgent care place, a guy with a full tattoo sleeve is my nurse. That’s acceptable now? I mean, that’s great that you can be openly super-tattooed as a nurse now. I just didn’t know. But he doesn’t know what he’s doing, I’m pretty sure. I don’t think he swabs where he’s supposed to be swabbing for the strep tests. I am also underwhelmed by the physician’s assistant who sees me and basically just says, “You have laryngitis. ” Thanks, Doc. I could have told you that. Er. Whispered it, at least. I pay the required co-pay at the front. I have been told that I will be notified of the results of the strep tests. I never am. I drive all the way back to Chicopee. The next day I have planned to go to New York City again. The author Mary Gaitskill is doing a reading, and then the following day I’m supposed to meet with my professor, and then in the morning I have a flight to Toronto that departs from Washington Dulles Airport (since I bought it when I expected I would still be living in the D. C. area now). But now my throat is hurting, and my voice is limited to only the slightest whisper. I sleep lots next to Kaylee, who can tell that something is wrong and who sticks more closely to me than usual. And I read and write for my classes. And on Thursday, Nov. 19, I need to leave the house for a couple of reasons. First, I still haven’t picked up the fancy clothes that were shipped for me from the Santa Monica Men’s Wearhouse to the Holyoke one. So I do that. I turn pages in a small notebook: “I have laryngitis at the moment. ” “I’m here to pick up an order. ” Et cetera. I won’t lie: doing this is fun. Next I have to finish formatting that fiction thesis for Johns Hopkins. The problem is, I can’t do it on my computer, because I can’t seem to find the power plug for it, and the battery has died at this point. So I go to the UMass library again, to use the public access computers there. (I tried borrowing my mom’s laptop, but its Word software’s trial subscription was up and I didn’t want to try to install new software on her computer. ) The process of getting everything formatted takes longer than I was expecting it to take, but that’s fine. And I sleep, and I am awake all night again, and Bruce gives me a ride to the Springfield bus station. I’ve lied and said that I have school things to do this weekend, when in truth I’m going to Canada again. But those tickets, bought so long ago, require me to take a Greyhound to New York. So, there go a few hours. Then on foot from the Port Authority to the Megabus stop, and a ride (but in the reserved seating up in front on the top level of the bus, fortunately, in one of those seats where I never have anyone next to me because few people would choose to pay an extra seven dollars to get a single reserved seat that they know will be next to a stranger) to Washington, so there go a few more hours, and then the Metro to the Rosslyn stop, then a dinner break before an hour-long bus to Dulles Airport, all for a one hour flight to Canada. At the Toronto airport I disable cellular data. I don’t want to mess with roaming charges while outside the country, and I also don’t want to mess with my mom, who shares a family cell phone plan with me, finding out by looking at the bill that I have been in Canada. I ride a nice train downtown. I check in at this city’s Hostelling International location. I sit down at about 1:30 for a beer, and to write in my black notebook. I have only slept for a few hours when I wake up in the smelly darkness of the hostel room. Pulling myself together is difficult. By the time I’ve gone downstairs for the free bag lunch, walked out the door, and make it to the nearest Starbucks, I’m running short on time before the Canadian OT exam. I summon an Uber. While waiting for the car I spill my coffee. When I ask, the driver says he is willing to stop at the next Starbucks he sees. That happens. Then I’m at the Exam Centre building at the University of Toronto, presenting my passport, being told to sit at a desk. And the test is in two two-hour-long sections, with one forty-five minute break. And when I’m done I’m feeling wide awake again, although I was tired earlier. So I walk around for a bit, buy some candy, and see the latest and final Hunger Games movie at the Rainbow Cinemas. I sit at some restaurant and have a glass of wine. I dunno. I should be sleeping, and so eventually I am back in bed and doing exactly that, but then it’s after midnight and I am walking a good long time trying to find a place that I saw on Yelp or whatever, but away from the hostel’s wifi I’m not able to look things up. I end up at a Tim Horton’s for a while, writing for school. Then I’m doing more work while sitting at a table in the common area of the hostel (where everyone has been great to me). Then I’m walking, a little past nine in the morning, to the Enterprise car rental place there in downtown Toronto, where they’re even more pleasant to me. Stop it, Canada; I don’t know if I can take all this kindness! I’m surprised that when one of the women (the one not speaking in a Francophone accent) says to me, “Virginia! I grew up in South Carolina, so I’ve been to Virginia many times,” I am not annoyed but am in fact happy to chat. I don’t know if it’s because I am thinking ahead to hopefully living in this country and so I am quick to appreciate anything that looks like socializing with Canadians? Maybe? Or maybe it’s because my voice, which was almost completely gone so recently, is now capable of conversation again, so I have a renewed appreciation even of small talk? Then I’m driving to the city of Niagara Falls. I drop off the car. Enterprise offers free transportation to and from their rental centers, so I have them drop me off where there are some various restaurants and where I am near the Rainbow Bridge. (I have already driven slowly and looked at the falls before dropping off the car. ) I put two quarters into a turnstile and walk to America. I enjoy—more than I thought I would—walking the paths by the American side of the falls. I walk under mists. I walk accidentally through mud. I walk to where hundreds of seagulls all stand on some rocks and I am because it is the off-season the only human watching them. Although I still will be commuting from Massachusetts to Manhattan on Mondays for the rest of the semester, I at least am done with most of the wild traveling I have been doing other than that. The thousands of dollars it has all cost! But at no point was I really being irresponsible. The only thing I almost wish I didn’t spend the money on this year was Burning Man. All the stuff I’m doing toward applying for permanent resident status in Canada (and Australia)? I stand by that stuff. (And the Alaska trip was incited by Rosalyn’s giving me a voucher for Alaska Airlines, and I booked the flights months ago, so the whole thing wasn’t that expensive, and it was worth it to now know that I have completed America. ) 68 A flight from Buffalo to New York. 69 I can’t get on board with discussions of politics as I see them happening in my Facebook feed and on the television. Righteous, condescending hyperbole is the popular flavor of article, so every day people are sharing (or Facebook is recommending) these articles with headlines that will be something like “Comedian Destroys Trump on Registering of Muslims” or “Democratic Congresswoman Schools Fox News Hosts on Why Black Lives Matter Movement is Needed”. How can I feel triumphant about things any reasonable human being could see are true being expressed in the media? It is not really for fear of things getting worse in this country that I am trying to leave it: it is for distaste with what I already think is wrong. But truly, if politicians begin to discuss the notion of internment camps for citizens as if it is a suggestion that a reasonable human being might make, the country is at a precipice, and the danger of remaining in it is real. And anyway, we effectively do not have a health care system in place in this country, nor do we have any willingness to institute one. I can no longer believe that Americans are more good than bad. To stay hopeful, I need to look elsewhere. "

    "body": "1 On New Year’s Eve my mother drops me off at the Hampshire Mall, where I board a Megabus bound for New York City. I sit near an actress (this fact I overhear her discussing), a magician chanting, a woman reading Foucault, and someone I think I maybe remember from years ago at HCC. I make my way to the Hostelling International—slowly, because I’m carrying both a backpack and a large duffel bag. Rosalyn calls. I say I’ll call her back in a few minutes. I put my things in the locker (which I remembered to bring a lock for this time) and step out onto Amsterdam Avenue. Our conversation doesn’t last long—just long enough to remind me that I’m worried about about how depressed she has been sounding. She sounds just as depleted visiting her friends in Maryland over the holidays as she did while we were in California. I keep walking, walking, walking, all the way to the East Village and the EastVille Comedy Club. I’m seated. I meet the two drink minimum through a whiskey and a beer. I watch comedy, all by white men who come across as having sane attitudes about everything except women. Then I walk, walk, walk even more, towards Brooklyn. While I’m crossing the Williamsburg Bridge a guy stops me to ask, “Hey, do you know if the Brooklyn Bridge has all this fencing around it, too?” I don’t know, and I tell him this. After walking on, I think about the question. He was with a friend and did not appear ready to jump off any bridges, so I decide that he was probably just hoping to take some photographs of the nighttime cityscape. Outside the Music Hall of Williamsburg I wait in line for the They Might Be Giants show. I watch the security people ask the woman and man in front of me to step aside and calm down after they start being weirdly aggressive in their drunkenness. I feel like this is a validation of my instincts, which led me a few minutes before to brush off the woman’s sloppy attempts to make conversation with me. The show—which is by a band I have seen live multiple times, the first time probably something like eighteen or nineteen years ago—opens with the song “New York City”, from their 1996 release Factory Showroom. As accidental welcomings to a city go, this is a pleasant one. I time my restroom break to happen during the countdown. The moment itself is not what’s important, at least not this year. Then it’s 2016. To the sounds of the band playing “Aud Lang Syne” I step up to the bar in the downstairs lounge. The bartender gives me the beer I ordered, then slides over a champagne toast, too. “Happy New Year,” she says. Back upstairs in the entrance lobby (the only area in the venue where I get cell phone reception) the man and woman from outside get even more aggressive with I don’t know if it’s staff or someone else this time, but the guy is apparently genuinely ready to throw down at a They Might Be Giants concert at 12:30 in the morning on the first of January. He is held back and whatever. I assume he is ejected from the venue. Then the show goes on for a long time more, and hurray! Rah! And places are still open and selling food, so I buy and eat some Mexican food before heading back to the hostel via the subway, where I am somehow surprised to find myself older than almost everyone I am squished on the train next to. Getting up in time for the 11 AM checkout the next morning is an inconvenience, but I am not horrifically hung over or anything. The most difficult part is carrying the duffel bag as I walk to a restaurant and then to where I will be catching a bus from Manhattan’s Upper West Side to its Upper East Side. I drink a coffee and get a doughnut nearby to kill time before the officially declared move-in time of 3 PM. But when I get to the entrance of the 92nd Street Y (a. k. a. the 92nd Street Young Men’s and Young Women’s Hebrew Association, a. k. a. 92Y) I am just given a key to my room by the front desk attendant and told that since the residence office is closed for New Year’s Day I should go the following day or at my earliest convenience to get my ID photo taken and things like that. My room is on the eleventh floor. This makes me happy: I like being high up. I sit next to the window and look out over Manhattan. Like all good decisions, my choice to live here is ludicrous. 2 I nap. They Might Be Giants are playing again at the same venue, so I go. They play a set of songs from their album Flood as well as another set. 3 I am up all night, working on my mad plans for life. I sleep in. I see They Might Be Giants for the third and final of this series of shows. It’s a “horn spectacular”, with almost all of the songs featuring horn arrangements. Then I go to the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, where I have bought a ticket for their midnight comedy show. It’s an overall better show than the one I went to on New Year’s Eve. I walk again through late-night Times Square, where the ground is littered with remnants of streamers and the like from the New Year’s Eve celebration. Enjoying my walk, I extend it to the 51st Street station before catching the 4 train uptown. 4 Bradley seems pretty cool. At a Venezualan restaurant in the East Village the waiter pulls out the table for him. He wears black clothing and a pentagram around his neck. Runs with a nerdy crowd. Has lived in New York before, but is just recently back after living in Califorinia for a couple of years. The two of us go to the nearby location of Big Gay Ice Cream after dinner, then we sit at Starbucks for a while. The conversation flows well. Things only start feeling slightly off after we have sat and had a glass of wine each. Perhaps my suggestion of moving on to a second place (once the first is closing) and getting a second drink is not a great idea, but we end up at a fairly classy place where we sit at the bar and I get another glass of wine and he gets gin and he becomes increasingly visibly drunk to the point of saying so—“I’m drunk. ” And he’s a little embarrassingly loud with things, then, such as talking about a woman who is seated only a few feet away from us at the bar. He’s stumbling outside, almost falling. Eventually he decides that he is not eager to take the subway all the back to his place in Brooklyn, so I hail a cab for him. We hug goodbye. He looks like he’d want a kiss, but with him being drunk I just smile and touch his cheek. Then I stay up all night, amending up my page on Bandcamp. 5 My father made me touch him in ways I didn’t want to, and it didn’t matter. No more than it mattered when he hit me. He didn’t feel emotion, and there was nothing sexual, so it was okay. One cannot complain about these things. I am on the downtown 5 train, standing, thinking about these things. He kept me isolated from the other children. My stop is Bowling Green, by Battery Park. It still isn’t really cold, but it’s night, and the population is sparse. I look south to the Statue of Liberty; north to One World Trade Center. I meet this James for the first time at the Museum of Jewish Heritage. He avoids eye contact from the outset. I’m not sure what he was expecting. I believe my pictures are representative. My profile said that my body type was average. I am dressed well. My date last night would have kissed me. The date I met before him did kiss me. I am not entirely unlikable. But not everyone is going to like me. “Thanks for agreeing to this weird suggestion of a place to go,” he says, pushing the “up” button of the elevator. After we have walked through the museum for about a half hour—it is closing—and I have told him some of the basics of my New York existence, we walk outside and toward Hudson Eats, an eatery in an office building by the… can we just call it the World Trade Center? Let me google that and check how people are referring to it. Oh, thank God. One World Trade Center is just the skyscraper; the larger complex is still known as the World Trade Center. Anyway. On the walk along the waterfront, James, who works in publishing, has asked me about my writing. “Someone just yesterday was actually trying to convince me that I write spec fic, although I’ve usually called it literary,” I say. I prompt him to talk a little bit about genre distinctions. I ask whether he has noted any substantial changes in attitude around the use of things like fantasy and sci-fi tropes. He gives a couple of specific examples of writers with this tendency and tells anecdotes about how they or their publishing houses went about representing the nature of the work. He mentions literary writers who trend speculative and speculative writers who trend literary. Inside the office building, then, we continue talking. When he says that he has been working for the same company for years now, I say, “Well, congratulations—you seem like you still have your soul. I think it can be hard to find something to do for that long that doesn’t end up soul-sucking. ” Perhaps finding this premise too intimate from a stranger he doesn’t like, he won’t accept it. “Well,” he says, ascending the escalator. “What makes you think I’m not just fooling you? I read something by a woman who went on a Tinder date with Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceuticals douchebag?” “Yeah,” I say. I recognize the name of the young CEO, whose braggardly use of social media recently made him a face of rich person villainy to an America still unwilling to accept that the sort of evil profiteering he engaged in—purchasing the rights to AIDS drugs and then raising their prices astronomically—is a feature, not a bug of the extreme form of capitalism our institutions enforce. “That woman said that actually, he was one of the better dates he went on. ” We get to the bougie food court. “Here,” he says. “You said you wanted coffee? I’m going to go to a different place, over there. ” I stand in line alone. The kiosk has an espresso machine, no drip coffee, but an americano will serve me just fine. It occurs to me, then, surrounded by the dull wealth of the lowest of lower Manhattan, that this is exactly the sort of place Martin Shkreli might have taken his online dates. Once we’re seated, I ask him some first date sort of questions. James usually looks past me, answers the question in what sounds like a fairly earnest way, then turns the question back on me. I answer inarticulately, trying to smile and be relaxed but presumably instead forgetting to breathe and demonstrating befuddling sequences of microexpressions. This goes on for maybe thirty minutes. I’m thinking in advance that I might apologize good-naturely when we part ways. I’m thinking that I might say to him, “Thanks for meeting up with me, James. I’m sorry you got the awkward Levi. ” But he isn’t exactly helping me not be the awkward Levi, is he? Maybe it just is what it is. For some bizarre reason, I bring up the topic of money. I ask him about his relationship to money. After he has finished answering he turns the question back on me. I think for a moment, then say that I am just so happy to be able to not only meet my basic needs, now, but be productive in designing a life for myself… because I never had money when I was younger, because I didn’t grow up with the expectation that I would have a career, and I therefore never assumed that I would reach that point in my life. “Well,” he says as soon as I have finished my monologue. “I think we should get going. ” When we part at the train station, I start to extend my hand for a handshake at the exact movement he vaguely opens his arms. It is a general principle of mine that I do not deny hugs unless they are offered in a rude fashion or I have reason to distrust the person who is offering. So I go with a quick hug instead of a handshake—maybe it’s ritual for him? And I get the sort of hug you get from a person who knows you’re sick and doesn’t want to catch what you have. I am unsettled enough by my poor performance on this date that I get on the wrong train. I end up in Park Slope, then, drinking alone at a taqueria, and then at a sports bar—actually beginning to feel, in my distress, as sick as it seemed he thought I was. 6 I’m unexpectedly texting quite a lot with Leslie, someone who doesn’t have anything written in her profile on OKCupid but whose match percentage with me was high and who messaged me talking about Aimee Bender. Like everyone in New York City, she is twenty-five years old. She grew up in Harlem, lives with her mother and sister, and for work walks dogs downtown. She’s sharp. She comes across as assertive in text. 7 After getting in touch with the recruiter for this region I schedule a time to talk with the rehab director at a skilled nursing facility in the Bronx. 8 I have made plans to meet with Zelig again, for another night of karaoke. We go to the Cobra Club in Bushwick. It’s already busy in the front part of the bar when we arrive. I loom over him; we are finding that this is necessary in order to have a conversation. A large screen plays the music videos for the ’90s alt-rock songs that are making it so hard to hear human speech. “I don’t know how much I told you about me and my roommate,” he says at one point. “I remember you said something about shipping Hannibal with your roommate, but I wasn’t sure exactly what that meant. ” “Well. ” He looks down, smiles, and has a little laugh. “We have use of a van pretty soon, because we’re moving some stuff. So… we’re going to… use that. Yeah. I’m responsible for coming up with a scenario that would have us in the van. ” “How did you meet your roommate?” I ask. “We’ve been friends since college. ” “Wow. That sure is a happy coincidence that he wants to be involved in this stuff. ” A former co-worker of Zelig’s comes up and greets him enthusiastically. This co-worker is excited when I tell her about the karaoke that is going to happen in the other room; she came here simply to hang out at the bar. I keep apologizing for it—it usually is not my way to ask probing questions about things that are considered unusual about people, much less their kinky proclivities—but I also know that he’s public about these things, so I continue to inquire about his sadistic tendencies. “When did you realize you were into knives?” I ask. “Only once I learned that it was a thing you could do. ” “So, when you read about it on the Internet?” “Yeah. ” But his sadism predates that. He describes beginning to play scenes as a harmless way to fulfill his urges. Meaning to intentionally exaggerate, I ask, “So, this way you don’t have to be afraid you’re going to actually kill people?” “Yeah,” he answers, casually. Eventually a guy climbs up on a stool or something and yells at the entire crowded, dark bar full of hipsters that karaoke is about to start. Back there, the night continues. He sings. I sing. His former co-worker dances closely with one or more faceless-to-me other women. Then Zelig wants to move on. We’re both hungry. Oh, cool, there’s a place. Over a couple of burgers, then, we talk about her family and childhood. On the subway I try to talk to him, but he closes his eyes and says he’s tired. He tells me when his stop is coming up. He gets up and just leaves when we get to his stop. No goodbye. No hug. No looking back. Across from me, in that brightly-lit subway car, a man who looks homeless. He notices nothing. At an angle from me, a guy who looks like a homeowner, drunk and wearing clean, new sneakers. He notices nothing, either. I have just a couple of more stops to go. I don’t see Zelig again. 9 My Saturday night date, Brian, and I were supposed to meet at the Barcade. But, oops—he meant the one in Williamsburg, and I’m looking up at the Empire State Building when I get the message clarifying this. Don’t worry, he says. He’ll come find me at the Midtown location. The place is packed, awful, full of young urban professionals. I feel uncomfortable. I stand at the door. Brian comes in when I am about two-thirds of my way through an IPA. I get his okay to finish my drink so we can move on to somewhere a little less dense. We walk, then, and refresh our memories of each other’s stories. He’s in the process of applying to Master’s in Social Work programs. We find a nice and much more quiet place to grab drinks, a sit-down restaurant. I feel (although I have no way to gauge the accuracy of this feeling) that both he and the waitress who brings us the next round are more relaxed around us than I would expect if I were being seen as a straight man of my age. Am I making this up? Does it matter? (I have been feeling like the world increasingly fears me, now that I am seen less as a young man and more as just a man. ) I’m not sure how to read Brian as we walk to the subway where we will part ways. Fortunately, he takes the cue when I ask him, “So what did you learn tonight?” by answering: “Well, I learned that there’s someone else in Manhattan who…” something something something. I’m not really paying attention; I’m distracted by my happiness at being liked. Which means that I’m not on as solid footing emotionally as I usually like to think I am. But he’s inviting me to come over to his place in a few days, so hey. "

    "body": "10 David Bowie is dead, two days after the release of his album Blackstar, from a cancer that the public did not know he had. I pick up the Zipcar from a parking garage (although it’s a bit of a challenge for me to figure out how to get inside the garage in the middle of the night). I drive to my storage space down beautiful avenues populated with only a few vehicles at a time. I’m listening to that new Bowie album, which is excellent. Back in my neighborhood, I find parking on 3rd Avenue. I carry a few bags at a time inside, up the elevator, into my room. It’s not the full contents of my storage space that I bring—at some point I’ll go back and take more—but it’s all the work I feel like doing right now. Of course I’m planning to go to the Sidewalk on the day we all learn of the death of David Bowie. Who ever pioneered a more inclusive queer aesthetic? Who more than that musician lay a groundwork for the acceptance of genderfluidity, of changing identities in parts of the mainstream culture? Thinking about David Bowie reminds me, too, about when I first met Charlie, way back in the year 2000. Meeting him was a pivotal moment in my life. He introduced me to a social life in western Massachusetts, just as I got a LiveJournal. Did I ever mention in this Life Story that V. And Charlie added each other as friends on LiveJournal, coincidentally, from their home states on opposite coasts of the United States, the night before I met the latter? Well. Charlie, when I first met him, had also just recently returned to Massachusetts after, as he put it, he “went crazy” and traveled to New York City in an attempt to find David Bowie. Now I am no longer in Massachusetts. I have arrived in New York City, and David Bowie is gone. This is the only kind of sense anything makes, if you look at it with enough intention. Like the colors of the rainbow: was that a shade of pink, or was it an orange color that you misunderstood? Was there even a coincidence there, or just vaguely related facts stored in adjacent synapses? I get back to my place and watch his last music video, “Lazarus”:  By the time I got to New York  I was living like a king  Then I used up all my money  I was looking for your ass     This way or no way  You know, I’ll be free  Just like that bluebird  Now ain’t that just like me&lt;/i&gt; 11 Leslie texts in the morning. First I’m sitting at my desk under the pretense of multi-tasking, then I’m just lying on my bed with the morning light creeping in, responding to her always-quick responses to responses to responses. I sleep from late morning until mid-afternoon. Allison calls out of nowhere. I’m glad to hear from her. She asks me about the dates I’ve been going on—oh, that’s right, I tried texting her from Park Slope that night after the shitty date with the publisher guy. I’ve actually been reflecting to myself, from time to time, that I wish I had someone in my life to talk about this sort of thing with. But sitting in my room, on the phone, I nonetheless find myself sort of avoiding the topic. So we talk about her writing instead. She says, “I’ve been thinking about it, now that I started working on my book, and I want to try to get Misterio back together in some form. ” I tell her that I would be into that, in any form it might take. I also talk to the director of the facility in the Bronx. She says we’ll move forward with PRN work, for 3 or 4 days per week, at $50 an hour. Then I take my guitar with me down to Avenue A, set it down along with my coat at a table, and join the sign-up line at Sidewalk. Several Bowie tributes: a woman sings “Changes” while playing piano, a man performs “Jump They Say” while playing guitar, and another man carries a candle, wearing paint on half of his face and one of his arms, lip-syncing and swaying around the stage to “Blackstar”. The pair of sad songs I perform, “Another Great Depression” and “Bird and Raccoon”, do not steal the show, but oh well. It is not as though I am trying very hard to do that. The woman I happen to sit next to, who is visiting from Cleveland, carries on conversation throughout the night. She has me take pictures and video, and she reciprocates by capturing a couple of shots of me, too, and sending them through Facebook. I leave Sidewalk before the night has finished—maybe a bit before one in the morning—and as I am walking back to the subway I am moved to check out a place I have been wanting to stop in, a place that has a poster in its window appearing to be decades old and advertising soft serve. Through the window I’m not able to see anyone tending the store, but the door opens when I pull on it, so I step inside. There is fresh coffee on a burner at the counter, so I pour a cup. “Hello!” I then hear a voice say, from… the floor on the other side of the counter? An old man who looks to be in his seventies begins the gradual process of pulling himself up to stand. “Hello!” I say. “I didn’t see you there!” “Well,” he says, smiling widely, “I work a long shift. I start at seven in the evening and end at about four. ” “I was wondering,” I say, “If you’re still selling ice cream at this hour. ” “Oh, yes!” he says. “I like this ice cream very much. There is chocolate, vanilla, pistachio…” “Pistachio,” I say, “With sprinkles, please. ” As I walk back outside into a late January night, then, I feel happy about this exchange. I feel happy about the coffee and ice cream in my hands. I feel happy at the thought of the old man smiling in the way I think I tend to smile—in an uncontrolled, sometimes uncomfortably prolonged way. 12 I walk through Central Park in the morning. I sit at bakeries and write. Things are nice. 13 After Leslie postpones her and my plans on account of some weather-related moodiness, my date for Tuesday night is Ronnie, a forty-three-year-old attorney. She has invited me to a quiet bar in the Village—nowhere she has been before, but a place she found on Yelp. We talk mostly about work. I especially have a lot of questions for her regarding what her day-to-day job is like (“It’s paperwork, mostly,” she says. ) I was actually a little wary of meeting with her, and I didn’t have high hopes… but I’m finding myself involved and rather interested in the conversation we’re having. She seems passionate about justice. We don’t stay out for long before she checks her phone, though—she’s going back to Brooklyn—and says she wants to get to the train while she can still take the express instead of the local. I’m feeling pretty nonchalant as we wait for the train. Probably I’ll never see her again, right? But if I do, that’s cool. Then, out of nowhere, as we’re standing on the subway platform and waiting for the first train that we both need to take, she asks me if I’ve heard of a particular organization. “No,” I say. “If you want to look it up sometime, I know there’s a video…” “Should we look this up on one of our phones?” I’m feeling fairly energetic and playful, pulling out my phone with alacrity to help her share information on whatever this thing she’s talking about is. I ask her to repeat what I should be searching for. Google’s auto-fill suggestions add the word “cult”. She pulls up her own phone and goes on YouTube. “I don’t think this is the video I’m thinking of, but here,” she says, handing the phone to me. I plug in the ear buds that I have in my pocket. It’s some sort of a skit that doesn’t actually explain anything. “I don’t think that was the video you were looking for, no. Are you able to explain it?” “Well,” she says, “It’s this group. They get together, and there’ll be one woman and one other person, usually a man, but it can also be another woman. Basically, the woman takes off her pants, so she’s naked from the waist down, and the man keeps his clothes on, and he strokes her in an exact sort of way…” The strangers waiting next to us stare at the walls. I ask a couple of questions for clarification. She’s pretty matter of fact, while I maintain my nonchalance. She says, “I’ve known about it for a while, and my friend was telling me about it, but it took me a while to actually go. I was skeptical, in part because the strokers wear gloves, and that reminds me a little of going to the doctor’s office. ” I ask, “So what makes you bring this up?” “Oh. ” She pauses. “I figure it’s a way to meet people, with you being new in town. ” “Oh. Okay,” I say. We both use the same station for our connection. She walks me to where I need to catch my train, and we hug goodbye, and we don’t see each other again. 14 I get to Brian’s apartment in Bushwick later than planned. I’m not sure if that’s disapproval I sense when he comes downstairs and meets me at the door to his building. “FYI, my roommate may watch the movie with us. I’m not sure. And I told you about the dogs, right? He has two. I’m sorry. This is probably sounding worse and worse,” he has messaged me as I have made various navigational missteps in getting to Brooklyn. Up two flights of stairs to the front door. There is a little bit of barking by one of the dogs in particular. His roommate is there, says hi, seems nice. Brian hangs up my coat—a formality I’ve never cared for. I forget to take my phone from its pocket before he does that, and as a true denizen of the twenty-first century I feel weird throughout the night not having it on hand. Brian’s roommate does stick around as we watch Brazil, which I haven’t seen in years, and which makes more sense than I remember it making. Then he goes to bed and it’s just Brian and me sitting on the couch, talking and talking. It’s pleasant but feels a little forced. The conversation keeps dying, and we keep needing to pick it up. I learn more about his past, his years spent working at Barnes &amp; Noble, his process of coming out as gay. It’s 1:30 in the morning when I finally check the train schedule and decide that I am sick of crossing my legs demurely and leaning back relaxedly on the couch and waiting for him to edge forward or say something suggestive or something. So I say that I should go. He gives me an uncomfortable look at the door. I walk to the train. I go back to Manhattan. We don’t see each other again. "

    "body": "15 Casey is thirty-nine years old with a wife, two children, and a love of running. I meet him at Julius’, a historically significant gay bar in the Village. We sit at a table in the back. We have good, free-flowing conversation over drinks, laughing and commiserating. It all feels less forced than maybe any of the other dates I have been on in New York. He is more impressed than I would have guessed about my having been to all fifty states—folks are generally seeming to think that that’s a pretty cool fact—and we talk about dating (and it’s like, I say, “As a thirty-four-year-old in New York open to all genders, I can sort of theoretically date just about anyone. The dating pool is so big,” and then he’s saying, “But my cutoff is if someone is so young that I have to explain to them what life was like before cell phones,” and we laugh and I say, “Yeah, and it’s like, I grew up using a typewriter—like, as an actual, practical tool, as the thing that you typed with. Although that’s one of those things that sort of makes me sound older than I am, too. Like New Year’s Eve 2000, when I was celebrating on the streets of San Francisco and drinking from a bottle of wine. I mean, I wasn’t even legal to be drinking at that point, but that’s what I was doing,”) and we part ways and don’t text each other after, and the next night I see Bradley again and actually, that goes well, even though I start off a little bit nervous. I’m a neurologically funny person, and it seems like he keeps covering his pentagram necklace, and it makes no sense but I start to feel like his fidgeting and hand placement are a response to my glances, and we get some good pad thai there at whatsitcalled, near Astor Place, and then walk a couple of streets down and go for beer at Burp Castle, which is a beer bar intentionally meant to be a place for quiet conversation—the bartender shushes everyone when things get to a certain volume. I, cleanly-shaven and with a haircut that’s less long on the sides than it was and which I was sort of angry about initially but am sort of maybe feeling that I like now, and I get a lot of personal stories from Bradley about (among other topics and among other stories from other times) when he was young, a flirt, inclined to see any dating or seduction or anything like that as transactional. The time comes for another meal. We walk to try to find one particular place, but is it reserved for something else? Is it closed? Or maybe this is the wrong building that we have walked into and this is not actually the restaurant. Oh, there is the restaurant, but it looks too crowded and loud. There should be an IHOP down the street, Bradley tells me, although he is not someone who usually likes to eat at chain restaurants. He has asked me some questions: who was the first trans person you were with? And I say that I had dated someone who then came out as trans but then, no, wait, first there was a trans woman, one particular night, and, let’s see. Trans of course means a lot of things. He gets to the point where he is coming up with question after question to ask me, and I am neither trying to turn the questions back on him nor to ask him other ones, because when he appears to be in thought and I ask him what he is thinking about it tends to be that he is trying to figure me out, and it’s true—he has told me more significant stories about himself than I have told him about myself. At the end of the night, saying goodbye when he needs to catch one train and I need to catch a different one, a hug and two or three quick lip-kisses, and the next day I’m waking up early in the morning—it seems I’m always up in the morning, now, even though I’m always up late at night, also—and I’m walking in Central Park for a little bit again, and I’m sending Salma a message on Facebook to say that Rosalyn and I are going to be up there in western Massachusetts soon, and I’m also calling my mom to ask about getting picked up so that I will know which bus ticket to buy, and then I nap in the afternoon, which is a typical thing, and maybe the reason I keep waking up in the morning is something about the sunlight coming in through the blinds, the blinds which I don’t like, I mean, why don’t these things ever work as far as going up and down, ugh, but I don’t know, because I had a different sort of weird thing in my place in Arlington, where it was pretty consistent that if I went to sleep before midnight I would only end up napping for a couple of hours but if I went to sleep after midnight then my body would not object to the prospect of sleeping in, and then I take the subway to meet Leslie, finally, at the Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. She has a dog, Bryce, with her. Bryce belongs to one of Leslie’s regular dog-walking clients, for whom she is house-sitting this weekend. “I did not know it would be this cold,” says Leslie, “So now I’m thinking we should just wait on line, get our food, and then get inside as quickly as possible. ” I agree. I ask her how today went. She tells me that it went well—she has the keys to a famous actor-person’s place after meeting him and his dog and signing a non-disclosure agreement and whatever. So she’s a dog-walker to the stars now, apparently. But Bryce belongs to a non-famous (albeit able to afford a condo in Flatiron/Gramercy) couple, and it is to their place we go. There, Leslie and I sit on the couch (often with Bryce up on the couch also) and we watch old episodes of 30 Rock followed by old episodes of Frasier. We talk about the settings on my iPhone—why aren’t her texts sending as iMessages to me? I should update the software—and eat ice cream under a blanket and slouch with our feet up on whatever it is we have our feet up on. She says something about being ADD; I try to ask if that’s a serious problem for her, but she gets distracted by something on the television and begins talking at the characters, which I take to mean “yes”. We talk about the differences between city versus suburban versus rural life, a topic she has what I think is a curious perspective on. Having grown up in Harlem, obviously she is best acquainted with urban life. Interestingly, though, when she goes down the list of places she has visited I realize that she has seen rather little of rural America—that when she thinks of rural places she thinks instead of the Dominican Republic, the one other country she has been to. When we talk about gun control, it is clear that the status quo in states with lax gun laws seems about as foreign and absurd to her as it would to someone from, like, the UK or wherever. Eventually it’s time for me to leave, and we share a decent hug. She says, “Thanks for coming and hanging out. So, we’ll meet again?” and I say, “Yeah! That would be good. Although I’m going away for a bit next week, but after that, yes,” and I’m starting to feel nervous as she gives me unnecessary directions to the subway, and I get downstairs and the doorman holds the door and I thank him. Are you not supposed to thank a doorman? It feels weird enough to have someone open a door for me, and it’s even weirder when he doesn’t speak. Before I go down into the 23rd Street subway station that is just across the street, I lean against the wall and remind myself to breathe. Then I check my “likes” on OKCupid, and then I go home and I am tired and in the morning I am walking and sitting in one of the few different spots along Madison Avenue around the East 90s that I have been beginning to frequent, and I am writing in my planner all the events around the city I can find listed on the Internet that I am interested in, and normally in the morning Leslie would have texted, but now we have met and she hasn’t, yet. Referring to the various dog pictures she has sent me (including one that she sent while sitting next to me the previous night), I text, and she texts right back immediately, and we text back and forth a bit, and I say I wish I could have been a less anxious guest last night, and she says no worries, she didn’t realize I was anxious at all. I never used to worry about these things. It used to be—like, back when I was in my late teens and early twenties and hanging out on occasion with people I met at Haven or wherever. I just assumed, back then—and, you know what? I was right—that the reasons people had for wanting or not wanting to hang out with me were not something I could ever effectively gauge. And before that, when I was at Holyoke Community College, especially when I was still only seventeen and eighteen, leaving the area to take buses to California and then coming back and then repeating the process, I really didn’t know how to talk to people effectively. But this revealed itself in different ways, because I wasn’t pushing myself to try to talk to people effectively. So I didn’t get anxious. Instead I was just inward. There are moments I flash back to from around the year 2010, when I started to feel nervous about talking to people even in social contexts that before would have felt fairly safe. The anxiety was there for sure when I moved to Philadelphia, although it never seemed to be stopping me from being a quality date. I was nervous on my first date with Edith, I remember, but that then went away. I felt it a little with Allison when we first met for coffee, but her personality put me at ease, and I don’t think I felt it after that. Once I was living in Chicopee and going to OT school it was worse, and although I never talked about it to anyone I worried that my classmates and instructors picked up on it and limited their interactions with me as a result. In D. C. it was bad. But if it isn’t being read as anxiety in the people who are rejecting me, what is the problem? Oh, that’s right—I can never know. Nor, actually, is it my business. The quality in me that people are seeing is probably not interpreted in any consistent way. Probably I am coming across as too intense to one person, while another thinks I’m hiding something, while another wonders why we’re not having the same level of conversation we had in text, and yet another gets a creepy vibe from me, or is just like, “He’s just less attractive in person. ” We are clouds in the sky, watching each other’s shapes. Absolutely no pressure, Bradley says, texting me this morning, but he is going to be wandering to a few spots in lower Manhattan, and if at any point I would like to meet up, I should let him know. I text back in the affirmative. That’ll be good. I meet him at the pavilion thing at the Union Square subway entrance. It’s beginning to snow. We eat at Coffee Shop. Then, a subway ride to where David Bowie was living, here in New York, at the time of his death. A collection of candles, flowers, artwork, and letters, with several other fans standing there silently. The light snow was falling on everything. I already mentioned to Bradley that I wanted to grab coffee when we found the opportunity. “Let’s go this way,” I say, crossing the street. “I need a coffee; may as well get it where Bowie used to get his coffee. ” Once that is in my hand, we keep walking, until we see McNally Jackson Books—which is, for reasons I cannot at this moment diagnose, almost instantly my favorite bookstore on the east coast. From there we end up at an Au Bon Pain, eating some light fare, talking in the little seating area. “An idea I’ve had in mind lately,” I say to Bradley, after he has told me that the sort of historical book he would be interested in writing would probably be the story of one specific place and the different events that have happened there over time, “Is a project where a bunch of true stories that might have happened in different time periods and in different places would connect to each other, so it would be structured more like a piece of music, with repeating motifs, and… like, maybe there’s one story about one person in one place, and that segues into another story about that person meeting someone else who works in an industry that then gets big and becomes important to the town where that first story was set, et cetera, et cetera, and so the stories build on each other and are in conversation with each other, kind of, as more of them are told, and then that could continue basically forever as a book series or radio series or television series…” A guy who probably has an intellectual disability interrupts us. He asks us a question that does not entirely seem to make sense. We respond to him politely, and after he asks a couple of follow-up questions he apologizes and tells us to return to our conversation. I end up talking next about my nervousness/anxiety I sometimes get around certain people. Bradley asks, “Is it more around certain categories of person that you feel this way? Do you notice a trend?” and I say, “No. Sometimes I think that I see a pattern, but then the next instance just disproves it. ” He asks, “And how does your nervousness manifest?” and I say, “I find that I’m forgetting to breathe. So, like, I’ll have to stop and gasp for air suddenly. My eyes might dart around, and I might not be able to focus on keeping up my end of the conversation. Now, usually I think of myself as someone who doesn’t make things worse by thinking negative thoughts or whatever, but sort of without realizing it—it’s insidious—I started convincing myself, at some point, that people were noticing my nervousness. But here’s the thing, too: even if on some level a person is noticing, they can’t be sure of what they’re seeing. Like, if I’m talking to you, for example, and I see that you break eye contact at a certain moment or whatever, I might feel like that means something, but I’m not able to know for sure. So, for anyone I might be talking to, it’s going to be the same way. I can be naturally nervous, but it’s probably not going to be a big deal unless I start worrying about it to myself. So I’m hoping that now, by realizing that I’ve been making things worse for myself, I can sort of stop doing that. ” The same guy sitting next to us interrupts again, this time to recommend a late night radio program that he says stalks about things like what we’re talking about—“mysteries of the universe, and the supernatural. ” In the subway, when Bradley and I part, a few more kisses this time, with New Yorkers and tourists in transit hurrying past either side of us, getting to where they think they need to be. In Williamsburg I walk alone briefly, waiting for the doors to open at the event I’m going to. There’s Manhattan across the river. Me, I never want to live across the river from the place; I want to live in the place itself. In my black blazer with a black tee shirt underneath, my new standard outfit, which easily makes me a little bit fancy. It would look like trying too hard in most cities, but most of the people in Williamsburg, people who are young and into the arts and have never run from the approaching shadow of poverty because instead they could always just take a cab are wearing more money on their body than I am for sure. (Do not get me wrong, though; that doesn’t bother me. People wanting “nice things” and “new experiences” is not the cause of this era’s crimes. The actual cause is a thing that goes mostly unconsidered by the rich, the poor, and all of us in between—the fact that money’s potential impact on any given person cannot effectively be gauged by obsessing over its absolute value. It is not rich people buying a lot of things that causes poor people to go without: there would need to be a shortage of resources for that to be true, and this is not an age of shortage. What causes poor people to go without, then? An ethic in our society that says money should be conserved and managed thoughtfully and deliberately, but that nothing else should be. It is the belief that saving money is always the answer when in fact, especially for those people who do not have great earning potential at their fingertips, it is probably just as often the case that spending money would be better for them than stashing it in any account. When an average American talks about politics, they might talk about how much of their money gets taken out for taxes, but not about the overall quality of their life. If I have a basically good life, isn’t it my responsibility to start thinking of how to help my neighbor next? Isn’t anything else the very definition of greed?) I never want to live across the river, for so many reasons. It’s “The Tell, Vol. 4” at a venue called National Sawdust, just two doors down from the Music Hall of Williamsburg on N 6th Street. Storytelling shows have been a trend for a number of years now, with shows like The Moth inviting people to tell their most engaging personal anecdotes in front of an audience. This is an affordable little show that I just found out about this morning, and I’m interested in seeing what both Nellie McKay and Jeffrey Lewis do. The crowd especially loves Jeffrey tonight, cracking up at both the two songs he plays and the story he tells. I know and enjoy a few of his albums, but I haven’t seen him live before. The quality of his performance exceeds my expectations. Nellie as always has a personality that’s a joy to watch. Near the end of the night, the host, Michael Leviton, talks about when he first moved to New York. “My first night here,” he says, “It was a Monday night, and the friend I was staying with told me, ‘You should go down to the Sidewalk Café. ’ And on that night I met so many people, so many characters inside this one little place with an open mic. I literally don’t know what my life would look like today if I had not gone there. Even on that first night, Nellie was one of the first people I found myself talking with. ” I think back to seeing Kimya Dawson, one of the better known artists to come out of the Sidewalk. That was several years back, when I was living in Philadelphia. I went to that show with Brianna, who was nice and who I eventually pointed to the listing for that job at Planned Parenthood she had always wanted and which she ended up getting, and whom I kissed a little, I remember, one night, with us pressed up against each other horizontally on my couch in that sixteenth floor Center City apartment, although I was playing coy and then jumped up and said, Mmm, but okay! Let’s go where we were headed before all that! which is a sort of thing I am prone to do, but anyway. In Philadelphia I also saw that Frank Turner show, where the openers were Andrew Jackson Jihad, and I really initially bought tickets to that show to see the latter act, because I didn’t know Frank Turner’s work yet. And I was realizing (because at both of these shows I bought merch by handing money to the artists themselves as they sat waiting for business behind a table inside the venue) that in my life, as I began organically to get into more indie musical acts, being a fan of music was starting to feel more and more like just making friends with someone. It was a weird thought, because obviously I couldn’t and would not anyway be inclined to just hit up a singer I enjoy and be like, Hey, you want to grab some food and sit in the park? But it also felt like a true thought, true on some deep level. Like, you meet some people and you fall in love. You meet some people and you become fast friends. You meet some people and you enjoy each other, but you still only really hang out when other people are around, too. You meet some people and you get along, but you wouldn’t really interact with each other except in a certain environment. But there are also the people you don’t interact with directly, although you swim in the same general area of a much larger body of water. Your perspectives are similar. You probably face the same weather patterns when a storm passes over the water. You might interact with the same third party here and there. And eventually it becomes clear that what you are all swimming in, you human beings in this larger body of water, is the story of all humankind, which we will into existence, which we choose to share with the others who can hear, who are the others swimming in that same general area of that much larger ocean. This is another level of friendship—one that, if we truly appreciate it, can be a reminder of how very much alone we ultimately are unable to be. "

She has received some upsetting news about her health insurance: she no longer qualifies for the plan she has been paying for, and she can’t afford the next level of insurance that is available through the health connector. (As a dog walker, she doesn’t have insurance through any employer. ) This seems to have sent her spiraling. She talks about how unhappy she is to be living with her mother and sister. She talks about wanting to leave New York City, which is an expensive place and stressful to her. I try to help. She tells me repeatedly that I am not succeeding. Then I am on a train to Brooklyn, and Leslie seems to be settling down. I get off at the Barclays Center stop—the same stop I got off at when I accidentally took the wrong train that one night. The wind is making the cold feel rather awful, especially in comparison to the rather mild weather this city has otherwise been having so far this winter. I meet Chelsea at an Australian pub. Her printed sweatshirt is merch for the Welsh band Los Campesinos! (punctuation theirs). I have decided in advance that Chelsea would be laid back and easy to chat with. Actually, I decided that when I first saw her profile and considered messaging her. And I’m right! She’s shy, and she talks about her entertainment interests more than anything else, but she has decent tastes in everything, I think, and I like that I don’t need to keep prompting her conversationally. Our meals are soon finished, and the start time of the comedy show approaches. We step back out into the fucking cold night and walk down the street to the venue. We’re seeing Wyatt Cenac’s Night Train, a weekly event hosted by the former Daily Show correspondent. This week’s lineup includes Eugene Mirman and Marina Franklin. I didn’t know it was going to be the sort of event that requires most of the audience to stand, but it is. Wyatt has announced that there is going to be an afterparty at a nearby restaurant called Pork Slope. (The afterparty has been given some satirically offensive name relating to the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. ) Chelsea isn’t interested in going—she has work the next morning and says that she doesn’t do well without adequate sleep—so we casually hug goodbye and she descends into the subway as I walk to where Wyatt Cenac is going to be bartending. I arrive pretty early and get a seat at the bar. I eat nachos and drink beer. Eventually, lacking anyone to really interact with and sick of just poking at my phone, I’m ready to go. From behind the bar, another Daily Show alum, beloved humorist and writer John Hodgman, asks me if he can get me anything. “I don’t suppose you have the ability to get me my check, do you?” I ask. “I do not,” he says. “That’s what I figured. Don’t worry about it. Thanks, John. ” But he is clearly behind the counter less as a novelty for comedy fans and more just to help out at Wyatt’s event. I see him poking at the touch screen register, thinking, glancing over to where the regular bartender is, then touching the screen again. Aw, crap. He’s actually going to waste his time on this for me. I feel bad. “What is your name?” he asks. “They don’t have my credit card,” I say. “They just haven’t printed my check. ” “What did you have?” he asks. “Nachos, one six points IPA, and one Narragansett. ” “Nachos, and what?” I raise my voice and repeat. “Nachos and two beers?” “Yes. ” John Hodgman spends some more time at the register, prints out the receipt, needs a pen, looks for a pen, finds a pen. I write in a tip on the card, but I also hand over a cash tip. How much should one tip a television personality after somewhat drunkenly being an annoyance to him? 17 Visionary Medicine is my first class of the day. The classroom is packed full of twenty-something students, more than are supposed to be allowed. The full title of the course is Visionary Medicine: Racial Justice, Health, and Speculative Fictions. The class is being offered through the Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race as a 400-level undergraduate course, although there are several students from the Narrative Medicine program and other non-CSER students as well. The way the instructor, Sayantani Dasgupta, opens the class is by playing the video for Janelle Monae’s “Q. U. E. E. N. ”—which I know well, having watched it many times on the basis of it (and Janelle Monae more generally) being awesome. I take a train to a bus to the facility in Riverdale that’s ready to hire me. I get a tour of the place, pee into a cup for my drug test, then find my way back to campus. My second class is Illness and Disability Narratives. My only concern with this class is that it looks like we’re going to be writing each week in a different way about an experience we have had with illness, disability, or another condition, and it appears tonight, as I sit in this small classroom looking out at the lights in the windows of buildings on the other side of Broadway and beyond, that I am writing about being ten years old or however old I was and beginning to experience symptoms of a never to be diagnosed Tourette’s Syndrome, never to be diagnosed because no one involved had reason to care, because it was taken for granted in that time and place that if a condition did not have a demonstrably physical cause then it was all in your head and you were doing it intentionally and deserved to be punished and shamed for inconveniencing and more to the point being deviant from those around you. When I was finally bold enough, at the age of seventeen, in one of my first ever classes at Holyoke Community College, to say that I had Tourette’s Syndrome, the young instructor of the psychology course I was in, who was at that point probably still a graduate student, told me that actually I did not, because I had mostly been vocalizing sounds, rarely words, almost never obscenities. In the years that followed the Internet became more useful for researching things like this, and I could feel pretty confident in self-diagnosing. What I felt less confident in self-diagnosing was autism, and so every once in a while I would search and search and search for some other sort of condition that might result in strong impulses to engage in stimming (self-stimulatory behaviors, such as, in my case, bouncing up and down—either while kneeling or standing—or tapping my fingers rapidly and rhythmically against my palm, or drumming on myself, or simply nodding my head, for extended lengths of time, in order to feel better), because an autistic spectrum disorder is difficult to diagnose in adulthood, in many cases is not worth diagnosing, and because no one when I was younger ever seemed to consider that there was anything unusual about me that was not mo own fault. No one condescended to me; they just made school unbearable, so that I then quite understandably dropped out, then was required by capitalism to do things that terrified me or seemed unethical to me in exchange for money. (Think of something you used to have to psych yourself up to do when you were younger. Something that would make you shake just to think about doing. For me, that was making a telephone call. I would want to call a store to find out their hours, so I would pick up the phone, start dialing the number, then hang up. Then I would pause, pick up the phone, and start again. Then I would repeat until eventually I was able to make the phone call. Now consider that I went from this to working in a call center full-time. It was not that I was over my anxiety about talking on the phone by then; I just wanted to survive and could find no better alternative. ) Writing about anything directly related to this aspect of my life is the opening of a can of worms. I have been misdiagnosed by doctors more than I have been accurately diagnosed. The last time I tried to open up about my challenges in an academic setting was at Thomas Jefferson University, where they held onto and never returned my assignment that mentioned my having dropped out of high school, then called me in to tell me to dress better and act normal and made veiled comments about my being different from the others and needing to blend in so that I wouldn’t fail out of the program. Then I was told it was a very wise decision for me to drop out when I did. Class finishes. I walk out of the building and check my email on my phone. It looks like my enrollment in the Visionary Medicine class is secure. That’s good. I’m tired. The wind is cold. I shiver and wait for the bus, show my identification at the front door of the 92nd Street Y, take the elevator, put my key in the door, lie down, set my alarm, and go to sleep. 18 Work is much as it ever has been when working as an occupational therapist with long-term residents of a nursing facility. After a lot of waiting to resolve technical issues so that I can sit and get paid to watch videos for a while, I have a schedule and am taking the elevator to various places in order to find people. ADL and DME training, fine motor activities, stretching of fingers. I like that this facility is less busy than others I have worked in; there are fewer interruptions by nurses, less maneuvering around people to make it through the hallway, and so on. 19 Megabus. Listening to the audiobook of the very excellent H is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald. Up to Amherst—or, rather, the Hampshire Mall—since it’s my mother who needs to pick me up today and she is afraid to drive on the highway or to unfamiliar places. She drives me to Chicopee, and then without going inside the house I hop into the Volkswagen and drive to Bradley International Airport, where Rosalyn’s flight is about fifty minutes late but that’s okay because I’m one of those people who is willing to pay airport short-term parking rates in order to share a more pleasant and less rushed hello with the person whose flight has arrived. So, it’s not like I have to keep driving around in circles waiting for Rosalyn or anything; I just grab a seat and pull out my laptop and work on the Life Story until I get a text from her saying that her plane is on the ground. 20 Rosalyn wants to go to eat in Northampton. It’s cold out. She says Fitzwilly’s. I ask if the Northampton Brewery would be okay with her instead. We wait at the entrance. There’s a good amount of people inside, but I see no indication that we’re going to be led to a table. The kitchen is probably closed, I guess, leaving just the bar open. Would I mind if we walked? No, that’s fine, I say. She has been squished into a small seat on a United Airlines flight all day, so even if being back on the East Coast and outside in its cold winter weather is a bit of a shock, she would prefer to stretch her legs a little. She gets a lot of food. I just get the Noho onion straws, although that’s a large portion and I end up with a lot of leftovers. Sitting across from Rosalyn at a booth, I fidget with my glass of red wine, sloshing the liquid around. Then we head to Chicopee and cuddle Kaylee Puppy—Rosalyn hasn’t seen her since leaving to California. I’m tired. I sleep. 21 I drop Rosalyn off for her 10:30 appointment with a chiropractor in Hadley. I get a side of fried rice and write at the Hampshire Mall until she’s done. Then she has breakfast and I have a sundae at Friendly’s. Then we move on to Amherst. We go to what used to be Rao’s and is now Share Coffee—she has an assignment she needs to re-do for school. But she needs to wait and get some information from her friend Lisa, and she says that Lisa will probably not be awake until about noon Pacific time. To Amherst Cinemas to kill some time watching a movie, then. We see Anomalisa. She requests that we drive somewhere pretty, so I take us north through towns like Wendell, which I know nothing about. Instead of just occasional chunks of ice at the side of the road, we start seeing actual snow on the ground. “I don’t feel like you and I are in a relationship,” I say to her. “And I wonder how it is that you seem to be able to. ” She says she doesn’t mind that we see each other and it feels like we’re friends… but that there’s a partnership we have that is different than just being friends. We stop in Northampton. She wants to get tea at Dobra Teahouse, but the smell of that place overwhelms me, I find the chairs to be the least comfortable in the history of all mankind, and the way service is called is by ringing a hand bell that sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard to me, ugh, and also, every corner of this supposedly relaxing place seems designed to force me to be hyperaware and anxious about all the other people who are sitting nearby and talking with each other, ugh. Calming shit always stresses me out. So, once we’re seated, I say, “I think I might go somewhere else until you’re done,” but she doesn’t want us to do that, so we just leave, and we walk around the corner to Provisions because she wants to pick up some Ginger Libation. We drive back towards my mother’s place in Chicopee, but Rosalyn is beginning to cry, asking about our upcoming “anniversary” and what it means to me. I say that like I said last year, anniversaries are rarely more meaningful to me than any other day, especially if, like ours, it took work and deliberation just to determine what actually counted as an anniversary. I say also that if there is something I can do to make the day feel right, she can let me know. I add that I don’t have a sense of what would make it feel better to her, especially because I don’t want to be her boyfriend. “Do you want to keep driving?” I ask once we have pulled into the driveway but found ourselves continuing to talk. “I think that would be nice,” she says. I ask her if she wants to get any food or snack or anything else that I might drive us to. She says yes to frozen yogurt… but then she remembers that she needs to finish that assignment, so I recommend Pizzeria Uno, which is near the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield. At a table, Rosalyn pulls out her laptop and starts her assignment. I text with Leslie about podcasts and then read for class a little bit. Rosalyn ignores the food when it arrives and only starts eating it when she has finished the work. Something something sleep, I don’t know, I’ve been getting up early. 22 I hear Rosalyn come out of the bathroom after she has woken up. I walk over, hug her, and say, “Apparently, beginning just south of here, it’s all blizzard until, like, Virginia. We’re just barely north of where there’s supposed to be snow… What’s wrong? Are you sick?” “No, not sick,” she says, with her arms still around me. “Sad. ” I squeeze her more tightly. “Is it something Kaylee said?” “No… it’s not the Kaylee. ” 23 Rosalyn and I go over to Salma and Eric’s place in Easthampton. Sit for a bit in the living room. I make faces at Elena, set my cup of coffee aside and hold her a little, bouncing her on my knee, sticking out my tongue to make her smile. Rosalyn sits, chatting with Salma, glad that Elena is such a well-behaved baby but still not liking babies. “Let me see if there are any events going on,” says Salma, looking at her phone. “Well, there’s this. ” “Well, there are a lot of words I like on this flyer,” I say. “Beer, tacos, tropical, fiesta. So, that’s fine with me. ” Rosalyn remarks that I had never in my life eaten a taco before I met her. Oh, wow. That’s right. That is actually true. Before tacos and beers we go to Mount Tom’s Ice Cream. I just ate a sundae yesterday at Friendly’s and am not craving any more of that sort of thing, so I spend the change in my pocket on what I used to hear referred to as penny candy—small little portions, usually individually wrapped, sold nowadays for ten, fifteen, twenty-five cents. (I do remember at one point in my life purchasing candy for one penny—it was two individual Sixlets, sold somewhere on Cape Cod at some point in the late 1980s or early 1990s. ) Then we go to the New City Brewery for the aforementioned beer and tacos event. Basically it was just that someone from La Veracruzana was there with a hot plate, selling tacos. There aren’t enough available seats to allow me to sit, but that’s okay; I just stand next to Rosalyn and lean over, and I’m able to participate in conversation just fine. Driving back to Chicopee with Rosalyn, after Salma and Eric and Elena have left in their own vehicle, I say, “Well, that was nice. Although, I do wish that Eric weren’t such an angry person. ” “Yeah. But he is,” she says. It didn’t seem like he was angry at anything particular, but he did look like he was getting annoyed at every opportunity and seething in his thoughts about the wrongness of everything in the world. Rosalyn is still mourning something I don’t understand. I offer to cheer her up by going for that frozen yogurt we never got yesterday… but the place next to the Chicopee Chipotle that we used to go has closed, so we go to Friendly’s instead and get more ice cream. After eating the ice cream, basically all I remember is sleeping, first on the couch, then in a different position on the couch when Rosalyn wants to cuddle, then on the bed when Rosalyn suggests moving to the bed. Then the sun is rising, and she’s still asleep, and I’m up early again. 24 Rosalyn is sleeping in until about lunchtime in the mornings. She says it’s because her body is still on a West Coast sleeping schedule, three hours behind the time zone. Today I bring her lunch in bed—several slices of a large frozen pizza I have cooked in the oven. Among the days of this trip to Massachusetts, today (Sunday, Jan. 24, 2016) is the one that will seem to pass the most quickly and feel the most vague in my memory. I call to check up on my mother (who, after our arrival, disappeared up to Montague, in spite of the fact that when she had offered to do so I had kept telling her that no, Rosalyn and I did not need or want time alone with the house in Chicopee). I call while sitting behind the wheel of the car; Rosalyn is in the passenger’s seat, so she hears me ask into the phone, “Are you having fun avoiding us?” and after I’ve hung up she asks me, “Did your mom say she was trying to give us privacy?” and I respond, “No, she just called me a jerk. ” Then we go to Amherst Cinemas again and see Brooklyn, another good film. After that we go to the High Horse, where we get to talking (as we have a number of times) about one of the defining points of our relationship—how physical intimacy never worked for us—and I say that her touch could feel invasive when she didn’t look for any signals from me. She says, “That’s difficult, and I think that would be hard for most partners to understand. ” (I hear: “No one else would put up with you. ”) She continues: “Because usually if you’re in a relationship it’s expected that it’s okay to go in for a kiss or whatever else. ” (I hear: “People don’t get to choose their own boundaries; they’re socially dictated. ”) “And usually, when someone reacts like that, it’s because of some childhood trauma or abuse. ” (I hear: “You’re acting like some fucked up freak. ”) “Yes,” I say, “And I’ve just very recently realized that it does come from something like that, and it’s important to me that a person I’m with doesn’t just assume blanket consent. ” Her response surprises me: “Blanket consent—that’s a good term for it. That’s what a person usually expects in a relationship, and it can be confusing and hurtful if you don’t respond well to that. ” She explains that I should be more careful about this sort of thing in the future, with anyone else I might date. It seems like whenever I’m downstairs at the High Horse, it’s like this—so empty as to be lonely, but in a strange way exactly what I need it to be. "

    "body": "25 I’m thinking of finally going to Greenfield Coffee. I don’t remember if I’ve even been inside the place. Certainly I’ve never sat around inside. As I’m driving around to find a parking space, I’m stopped at the stoplight. Walking by the car is Sarah F. , I think, holding the hand of a small child. Is it? Still thin, but looking about the age she would be now. Was that what her face looked like, though? Am I just making this up? Where was she from? From up this way, wasn’t she? How did we even stop dating, if dating is in fact what we did? Was I kind to her? She and the child go into Greenfield Coffee. I decide to go elsewhere. I drive all the way to the Montague Bookmill, sit inside the Lady K. , watch videos about colonialism for class, then drive to Greenfield, where I park the car and walk—it’s not too uncomfortable while wearing a coat—along Main Street and the side streets off it. I text Allison so she knows I’ll be at her place soon. She comes out of her house and immediately starts asking me questions about my weekend. I say that Rosalyn has been feeling a little down and that overall this has been a bit more somber a visit than I was expecting. As soon as possible, I try to change the subject to her. She leads us to the People’s Pint. The woman taking our order for beer asks for our IDs, “So I can know everything about you,” and after looking at Allison’s license says, “Oh, you’re Allison! I live at the house on ___ Street. I’m sorry I didn’t recognize you. ” After they’ve chatted for a bit and the woman has left to get our drinks, I say, “You make so many friends wherever you go. It’s amazing. ” “I don’t make actual close friends that easily, though,” she says. “Maybe it’s easy to find people I can have a conversation with and who’ll say hi if they see me around, but that doesn’t mean we’ll seek each other out. ” There is a brief interruption as I’m brought my wine and Allison is brought a few samples of beer that she has asked for. She drinks the samples and decides what she wants, then I continue. “So, how do I really become friends with you?” “You are already there,” she says. “You’ve been there since you made a point of reaching out. You’ve been pretty… effusive… about wanting to be friends with me. ” “Effusive! Wow. I never hear that I seem that way from people. So, you should know that’s special. ” “Really?” “Yeah, I usually hear that it’s hard to tell if I…” The sentence continues, but I quickly decide to decrease the volume of its sentiment. What I usually hear is that it’s hard to tell if I have feelings for a person. Another woman comes by with Allison’s drink. She comments on what she thinks I’m drinking—a cider—but I say that it’s actually a rosé wine, and I hold it up to try to get it in a different light and show the color. She stands around and talks to us for a minute, too, before suddenly seeming to remember that she is at work and saying, “I don’t know why I just got so chatty all of a sudden. All right. Enjoy, guys!” You got chatty from being within Allison’s sphere of influence, I think to myself. It’s a good thing—enjoy it! She asks me what I’m doing next, and I tell her that I’m picking up Rosalyn in Northampton at around 8:00 PM, driving her to Boston to visit her boyfriend Chris… (Allison: “The married one?” Me: “Right. ”) …then driving back to the Valley alone and getting as much sleep as I can before my 7:00 AM bus to New York City. I add, “She didn’t want to just come to the bus station in the morning with me and take a bus from there because, I don’t know. She didn’t want to figure out the luggage situation. Something like that. ” “You know that’s weird, right?” she says. “Because that’s pretty weird. ” I drive to Northampton. For some reason, Rachel Z. comes outside for her goodbye. She waves at me and says hello when Rosalyn opens the passenger’s side door. I want coffee and food for the road. What’s convenient is Sam’s Pizza on Main Street. I pull into a parking spot as we’re passing by. Bob, who worked the door at Diva’s for years before starting work at Sam’s, asks if I’ll be going to Haven’s 20th anniversary night tomorrow. I say that no, I’ll be out of town. He says he’ll be working the door for the occasion. I drive Rosalyn to Boston—which is, in fact, pretty weird. 26 I mean, it was a few things. Tickling was the first thing I remember. He wouldn’t stop. My father wouldn’t stop. I tried everything in my power, and he wouldn’t stop. I told him not to. I told him I wasn’t joking. I said that he knew I didn’t want to be tickled, and I didn’t want him to keep doing it. So, I would yell. I would try to slap, but you know how that is. You know that they can hold you down. 27 The Greyhound bus to New York is extraordinarily late, so I miss my Visionary Medicine class. I notify Sayantani by email while still in traffic. I am also very tired. After lugging my bags from bus to train and back to my place, I nap until it’s time to get going for my night class. Then there is my night class. Then I sleep again. 28 Then it’s Wednesday. Once again I am not really dressed appropriately for work. I actually tried going to a Goodwill store before work, hoping to find some clothes, but the options there were slim and they didn’t have any appropriate belts. So, after I have seen all my patients for the day, I take a bus to a train to the UWS, and after getting coffee and frozen yogurt and pizza (in that order—I do adulthood right) I use my phone to reserve a Zipcar and walk to the parking garage where I need to pick it up. My plan is to get work-appropriate clothing from my storage locker. After I’ve handed my Zipcard to the person working at the garage, someone wanders in off the street to tell me his sad story and ask for change. Rather than acknowledge the man, I just keep doing what I was doing on my phone. Apparently my indifference to the man is read by the garage attendant as familiarity: he closes the entrance door behind us both, then takes the elevator to retrieve my Zipcar. Eventually the man stops talking about his time in prison and I look up from my phone and we realize that we have been shut inside a parking garage together. I point at the door that has an “exit” sign above it. “That door says ‘exit’,” I shrug. The man goes through it. Then my Zipcar pulls up. “Where is the other guy?” he asks, but through his accent, I don’t understand the question at first. “Where is the Black guy?” “Oh. He went out through that door,” I say. “I didn’t know him. He just came in asking for change. ” “Through that door?” he asks. He walks over to it quickly, opens the door, looks in all directions. I get into the Zipcar. The garage door opens. I drive to my storage space. Alone in the hot basement I push the rolling stairs, climb them, unlock the locks… …then accidentally let fall a bunch of ceramic bowls and mugs that Rosalyn gave me, plus that old reel-to-reel I bought off Mount Holyoke College for like five dollars at some kind of sidewalk sale they had. Everything breaks. I transfer a carload of stuff back to my place. I return the Zipcar. I take a bus back to my place. I sleep, although not for as long as I would have preferred. 29 Work, then a bus all the way down to Koreatown to meet with Bradley. He says he’s hungry; I’m staaarrrving. We talk about about his work, his roommates, his friends groups. “What part of Brooklyn is your apartment in?” I ask. “Lefferts Gardens. ” “I’ve never heard of that. Any relation to Carroll?” That doesn’t get a laugh. We ride on the Q train. He wants me to see the nice view, but I can’t from where we’re sitting, and the train is too crowded for me to be able to reposition. We go up the stairs to the apartment. He hears his roommate and that roommate’s fiancée, knocks on the door. They come out, shake hands, are fun, locate the cake in the fridge and spoon it out for us. Yay, cake! Then they’re gone, and it’s me and Bradley and the cat in his room. I choose Fraggle Rock to watch. We snuggle and kiss happily. He takes off his pants, turns off Fraggle Rock, and it is at this point that I basically just fall asleep on him instantly. 30 In the morning, riding the subway into Manhattan, to a Tim Horton’s for morning coffee and food. A kiss at the entrance to the office building where he works. Then I find my way way back up to Riverdale, and I work, and then I go back home, and zzz. 31 Leslie has canceled plans that we were trying to make for Saturday, saying that she is likely to be too tired to be good company. 32 Saturday night: Starbucks. A one-armed man falls on me as I sit and read for class. “Are you all right?” he asks. “Yes,” I say. “Are you all right? I want to be sure everyone is all right. ” “Yes, I’m fine,” I say. “You’re sure you’re all right?” Soon, a different man is standing near the door, asking loudly, “Why does everyone look like it’s the end of the world?! Everybody’s quiet and no one’s smiling! What’s so awful that you can’t smile?!” Sunday night: Meeting Bradley in Brooklyn. I am very hungry when I arrive, not interested in eating a cheese plate. I don’t think the guy serving us is very fond of us. Perhaps we’re under-dressed? Maybe our discussions of our personal histories seem too intimate, not wine-and-cheese-place-ish enough. Maybe it’s something else. “I trust everyone, but rely on no one,” I say to Bradley about my approach to life. We go back to his place and all of that. Monday: A subway ride with Bradley, who has to work in Midtown. Then I continue uptown, eventually making my way to the Bronx. I have agreed to work. I’m not happy about it. Five days this week? Ick. All I wanted was three days per week. Monday night: I meet Chelsea at Sidewalk. She leaves early, before I perform, but says that it’s the sort of thing she might be interested in going to again. Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton win the caucuses in Iowa. Tuesday: Wake up early and hurry to finish assignments for my noon. Eat lunch. Hurry to finish assignments for my night class. Go home tired. Wednesday: As I sit down to discuss something with the rehab director at my job, she says, “Oh, and I have to change your schedule today, Levi. This patient… [She looks at my schedule, then points to the name] doesn’t want to work with you again. She said it’s because you’re not from here and you don’t know New York City. I told her that that doesn’t have anything to do with your clinical skills. And then she tried to tell me that I don’t know New York City. And I wanted to tell her, I have lived here all my life. I have lived all around this city. She wants to tell me I don’t know New York City? What, because I haven’t heard about the one thing she wants to tell me about, that negates decades of my living here?!” My day goes later than it makes any sense that it should. It kind of seems like this is the case every day that I work. I’m nowhere close to getting out early enough to make it to this month’s “Narrative Medicine Rounds” event. Bradley and I get tickets to see the Smashing Pumpkins, with Liz Phair opening. Thursday: More work. Still work? Friday: I have messed up my cash situation. I expected to have my financial aid refund for this semester by now. I have a ticket to the second-to-last Chumped show at Suburbia in Brooklyn, but I can’t really do a night out at this point, so this plan gets cut. Saturday: Supposed to be a short work day. On paper it is. In practice it really isn’t. I’m remembering some more of the reasons why I keep almost swearing off nursing home work. Sunday: I meet Bradley at Tom’s Coney Island, where we get four different appetizers and split them between us. “She likes you,” he says of the waitress, who is chatty and keeps touching me. We walk out onto the pier. Bradley confesses that he gets intimidated walking out onto things like this, but as we stop and lean against the side and wait and he gets used to where he is, he keeps saying, “Okay, let’s go out a little farther. ” We talk about… well, it seems like he keeps asking me questions that I am unable to answer without getting really philosophical and wordy. As is usual in my life, I disagree with the premises of most of the choices I am asked to make. (“If you could be reincarnated as any living thing…” he asks, and we spend the next five minutes clarifying the details of this hypothetical reincarnation. What defines life? The category of “living things” is defined by the limits of our ability to see analogues for our identities within the physical states of matter. After we have agreed on a groundwork of rules, I say, “Hm,” for a couple of minutes before finally answering, “The Earth. ”) “Thank you for agreeing to come out here with me,” he says, as we walk the boardwalk. “You’re welcome!” I say. “Of course I wanted to come. The movie montage of our dating wouldn’t be complete without a visit to Coney Island. ” Monday I have set aside for reading. I walk across Central Park to Columbia, do some reading there, then walk back. I stop at places for food and coffee along the way. Tuesday of this week (Feb. 9, 2016) is pretty much identical to Tuesday of last week, except that I get a text from the rehab director at about 10:30 PM telling me that there were fewer admissions than expected and so I don’t need to work the following day after all. Wednesday is wonderful because I don’t have to get anything in particular finished or be anywhere at any particular time. In the evening, before it closes, I finally go to the gym in my building at the 92nd Street Y and go through the process of signing up there. It is an utterly ridiculous thing that I have been living at the 92nd Street Y, in a private room but with shared restrooms, with the other rooms all filled with studious nineteen-year-olds. I use the treadmill while listening for the first time to the entirety of the Dandy Warhols’ Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia. Thursday is a work day, but not as lengthy as a lot of other work days have been. The difference between working five or six treatment hours and working seven or so treatment hours is substantial, especially because it can mean, as it does today, that I leave and can catch the bus back into Manhattan before the facility’s dinnertime. I figure I’ll spend the evening looking at some ongoing projects that haven’t had my attention lately—like Australian and Canadian immigration stuff—and figure that I may as well do this downtown for a change of scenery. I think of going back to McNally Jackson Books, where I’ve seen there is also a free event of vague interest going on tonight. As the bus gets into Midtown, though—its final destination and my intended transfer point being Penn Station—I think of Bradley and wonder if he might still be in the neighborhood. He is, and so about fifteen minutes later we conveniently reach Macy’s at about the same time. It’s freezing cold, so we try the food court inside Macy’s. Macy’s doesn’t meet our needs, though, so we head across the street to an Irish restaurant where I get a chicken curry and he gets fish and chips. (“I’m surprised to see you get a curry,” he says. “You usually don’t like strong flavors. ” “That’s a common misconception,” I tell him. “Spicy food doesn’t actually tend to register as a strong flavor to me. When I eat this, I mostly just taste plain chicken. On the other hand, if I had anything with that vinegar you’re using on it, all I’d be able to taste would be the vinegar. ”) Then sitting in Starbucks for a little bit, talking about New York City. Then I see him to the subway. We kiss. I walk an avenue block to the E, which takes me to the 6, which takes me to 86th, and I walk back up to the 92Y, show my blue badge to the people at the front desk who probably know me by now anyway, then ride the elevator up to the eleventh floor. I go right to sleep, but wake up in the middle of the night, maybe around four o’clock. I get up and pee and have that awful feeling one gets when one realizes that one will not be able to fall back to sleep despite still being tired. I email one of my contacts at the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario, with whom I started the process of registering as an OT last year. I let them know that I passed the Canadian certification exam, but that I don’t expect to have legal work status in that country before my application expires in April. (This is complicated, because technically, after the April deadline, if I have not met all the requirements of registering in one of the Canadian provinces then I should need to go through a whole new, much more expensive application process before even getting to take that exam. ) I still need to fax Bay Path University, f. k. a. Bay Path College a request for a transcript so that I can then mail off the Application for Recognition of Occupational Therapy Qualification that I need to apply for an Australian Permanent Resident visa, which would give me the option to settle there. (Have you read about the twentieth century? Or any of the centuries before that? Specifics of the U. S. aside, I think keeping one’s residency options open seems wise given how frequently and rapidly states go to shit. ) Work the next day is not too difficult and not too long, but I’m still tired, and when I get back to my dorm room at the end of the day I sleep pretty much immediately (until waking at midnight). Then I’m up until like five in the morning. I nap for a couple of hours. I work. It is frigid outside—single degree temperatures and extreme wind chill. I run into the Astor Place Starbucks, get coffee. Then I get in line outside the EastVille Comedy Club, where I coincidentally arrive just before Bradley does. We see Janeane Garofalo do a set. Two of the other comics have sets I have already seen (presumably here on New Year’s Eve, although I do not clearly remember), and the other two are moderately enjoyable, even if they seem to follow the twenty-first century male comic trend of making jokes mostly about Internet porn. Bradley keeps turning to watch me after punchlines. I frown whenever he does this, but he doesn’t get the message. We try to find a place to eat after the show, because I’m feeling (as I describe it to Bradley) “grumpy” and don’t want to be that way when I get back to his place. He (a little tipsy after the two drinks required at the comedy club) has us take a cab to the Coffee Shop, because he loves that place. There, I never get the chance to tell him how I felt about him watching me inside the comedy club… because he has a lot to say about how inscrutable I am, how difficult it is for him to not be able to read me well. He says things cautiously, with prefaces to his prefaces, saying that sometimes people find him overwhelming. He pays for us to take a cab instead of the subway back to his place in Brooklyn. “It always feels so decadent to travel by cab,” he says. Which is a perfectly acceptable feeling to have, just as taking a cab home is a perfectly acceptable thing to do… although, I don’t necessarily agree with his suggestion that “decadence” is a desirable thing… and it reminds me of something I said the last time we were together that was meant only to be a passing witticism but seemed to hit a nerve: “I inherited through my French blood a love of autobiography… and wine… and hatred of the bourgeoisie. ” Back in his bed, I’m happy to cuddle and fall asleep. I’m exhausted. But then it’s the morning, maybe five hours later, and something’s happening and he’s staring at me. Then I wake up again, and he’s staring again. Then he’s climbing on top of me: “I’m pouncing on you!” “No,” I say, pushing him off. “Not while I’m asleep. What time is it?” “It’s after nine,” he says. “What are your plans?” “To leave and go study at some point. Which… I guess, I’m getting the impression, that’ll be soon. ” He keeps pushing me in gentle ways to accelerate the process of my getting up and leaving. I don’t understand. It is very hard to get myself up and to wet my hair and to get my shoes on and to go out the door. I have basically been kicked out of bed and forced onto a train in the middle of my sleep. I pointedly give him a sad hug and no kiss as he shows me the door. Once I’m gone—on my way to the campus of Columbia to print out some things and do some reading before heading home for a nap—he posts to Facebook: “That really didn’t go as planned. ” He texts me in the afternoon to recommend something to do next weekend. I wait before I reply. There are certain languages I do not enjoy speaking. He is not the one I fall in love with. "

    "body": "33 My sleep schedule is off this week. I’m napping in the evenings, then sleeping, then napping in the mornings, then going to work really tired. I see Mary Karr and Helen MacDonald in conversation at 92Y. It’s a pleasure. Helen MacDonald’s memoir was one of the best new books I’ve read in years—lyrical, insightful, and unexpected. In person she seems every bit the voice she seems on the page. Memorably, Mary Karr earns the one applause line of the night by shrugging off Knausgaard: “Does anyone really think the response would be the same if a woman wrote six volumes about changing diapers?” (Actually, she phrases it more obscenely than that. ) Then it’s Friday, and I’m cleaning in preparation for my weekend with Andy. 34 Andy is a little bit late, so I walk on this very nice day past the many folks in Union Square who are hanging out, playing instruments, holding out “FREE HUGS” signs, and advocating for political causes. I go up the escalators at the Barnes and Noble, browse for several books I am not able to find, get a coffee, then go to find them when they text to say that they’re standing near where the two of us made out on our first date. I have planned out this weekend. Sunday is meant to be the most dramatic day, but I have at least figured out what I think would be worthwhile spots for us to check out tonight. First, a record store, so they can find something to put on their new record player. Then to a restaurant I found, a place that serves burgers and beer. “I’m feeling sort of high-strung,” I say. “What does that mean?” they ask. “I mean, I’m feeling tense and sort of… hyper-vigilant, or something. I don’t know why. ” But before long some combination of Andy’s positive energy and my moderate alcohol consumption has relaxed me, and I’ve started again asking the sorts of questions about their past that get them going into details and keep me riveted, leaning in, rubbing my beard because I am still not really used to having a beard, liking more and more somebody I already rather quickly came to really, really like. “Telling my mother I didn’t believe in God was harder than coming out as queer,” they say. “Oh?” “Yeah. She was never the type of person who would have a problem with that. She was very socially, like, ‘Do whatever you want. ’ But as I think I told you before, religion became a really big thing for her after I was born. ” I ask about what serious relationships they’ve had. What it comes down to is two relationships, each lasting about five or six years. The first was with a woman. The second was with a man they left after they found out he was cheating on them. Since last summer they’ve been dating, trying out what they’ve been most comfortable calling “ethical non-monogamy”. (They are not yet sure about polyamory—multiple loves—and how they might deal with that as a paradigm. ) “This was good,” they say once we’ve finished our food and drink. The sun has set when we go outside and I say, “Okay, let’s just have one more drink at some other place. I picked out one spot, not because it’s anything special but because it’s somewhere I went by myself one time and it was pretty laid back then. ” When we get there, though, it’s crowded and does not look like a great time, so we turn the corner and keep looking for someplace. “You know,” they say, “This is where my ex’s family lived. Right on this block. ” “What?” I say. “Right here?” They point. “Just across the street, in one of these buildings. But I guess that’s just New York City. Wherever you go, the odds are pretty good that it’ll remind you of something else, of some other time. ” They open a tab for us at the place where we end up—a more apt spot, at least when we first walk in. They’ve asked me to do what they did for me earlier—to give the history of my relationships—and I’m doing my best. The issue I’m having is that it’s also turning into a detailed history of my misfortunes, failures, and equivocations. I guess we were due to have me go over all of this, but it leaves me feeling like I have come across as a person who is disinterested in and/or bad at having serious relationships. Andy and I are cute, compelled to be close to each other, sitting on stools, with our beers on the little shelf thing that’s along the wall. When they go to get us our second round they come back with a game of Connect Four that the bar happens to have; they remember that I mentioned I’m good at it now because I’ve used it as a therapeutic activity with patients so many times. As we play they get into talking about how they can slow down time by paying attention. I listen and watch and nod, probably wide-eyed, probably grinning ridiculously. I say I think the two of us are special to feel this way, that we both are able and know how to savor our time in this way and in fact, you know, it feels like it has been such a long time since I moved here to New York City but really it has only been two and a half months and that fact seems bonkers. They say that actually, they don’t think it’s that special, that whenever they’ve talked about this with anyone they’ve said that the statement resonated with them in some way, that they really wanted to try whatever strategies they could suggest, that they were really interested in slowing things down. And I’m like, Yeah, they’re interested, but they’re not actually going to do it. Their lives will still rush by. They’re still going to blink one day and then realize they’re older than they can appreciate being. They’ll wake up in a life they can’t stand, with all the magic they used to know having drifted away to some distant, impossible forest. We finish our drinks. The bartender from earlier is busy and so someone else cashes out our tab, but Andy writes a thank you note to him on the receipt, saying that he was nice. In the morning I direct us to a nearby diner—one that sells both breakfast and non-breakfast food in the morning, so I’m able to get a fish sandwich. Andy actually goes for a salad, which I’d say is just as curious-sounding a choice for the first meal of the day. They see me to the stop where I catch the express bus to Riverdale, then they go to pick up a much-needed replacement for their phone’s battery charger. I stay in touch via text message while I work a short shift at the nursing home and then catch a bus back into Manhattan. Taking the bus through Midtown is a good people-watching opportunity. I watch as the pedestrian traffic increases and the bus moves more slowly… and then, there’s Andy! I just happen to see them from the bus, still seven or eight blocks from where we’re planning to meet. So, once the bus has stopped, I strut in the direction of where I saw them. And there they are. A hug and a kiss, and walking, floating, what is this feeling, okay and here we are at the macaroni and cheese place and I’m gonna stare at the menu for a bit to decide and whoa I can’t believe it but I even told them again last night that the thing I wanted was for us to have sex with each other in all the five boroughs of New York City within a span of twenty-four hours on Easter Sunday, and they were certainly struck that I had actually made the arrangements and planned the day, but they were also definitely into it and my plans for that begin now, with the supper we’re having being the last thing we’re going to do before we make our way to Brooklyn and to the hotel I have there. “I wanted to take the sex matrix with us,” they say, referring to the chart of sexual acts that they and their roommates each have completed in the different boroughs. “But it wasn’t on the fridge, and I couldn’t find it anywhere. I think Bernette was jealous and took it down. ” “You told her what we were going to be doing?” “I did. I hope that doesn’t bother you. ” “Nah. That’s okay. But why do you think she’s jealous?” “She and I have both been single, but I’ve been having more success, I guess? And I think that in some way she’s limiting herself… but that’s not really my business. ” Then I get a coffee, and then we’re on the subway and walking to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Oh! That’s nice, just as I imagined it would be nice when I saw it on the map and figured it would be a pleasant walk as we made our way to the hotel. Along the way we stop at a bookstore. I get an old hardcover copy of Giles Goat-Boy by John Barth. In the hotel room Andy and I lie on the bed. It is the nighttime, but it’s not yet close to midnight. I ask them about the history of casual sex in their life. “Well,” they say, “The obvious problem there is saying what counts as casual sex. I mean, what you and I are doing, would you say that this is casual sex?” “Well,” I say, trying to avoid sidetracking from my question. “Really what I’m asking about is the times you alluded to when we were talking before about our relationships. You mentioned that you weren’t counting brief or one-time things. ” “Okay,” they say. “But just for the record, I wouldn’t refer to what you and I are doing as just casual. ” “No?” I say. “That’s good. I wouldn’t, either. ” I smile. We hug, resting on each other. We can’t really keep ourselves from encouraging each other’s hands, but I remind them that we still have another hotel room to check into, in Staten Island, where I’d like for us to begin this five-boroughs-in-one-day thing. We walk to the parking lot where I’ve reserved a Zipcar. Because my driver’s license is missing, Andy has agreed to drive. I haven’t been in the front seat of an automobile for a while. We go over the Verrazano Bridge. “I like that I have such a better sense of where I am geographically when I look at the New York skyline, these days,” I say. We check in, find our way to the room, and close the door. “It’s past midnight,” they say when we’re both on the bed. “It’s Easter. ” The sex matrix showed that Andy hadn’t done anything with anybody in Staten Island before. For this reason, I made it first in our plans. Still, I’ve made it clear that for my part it’s the “all five boroughs in one day” thing I’m most interested in. They agree that checking all the boxes of the sex matrix is not really important. So, we stay focused on our pleasure instead. “Do you want me to do the check-out?” they ask me some ninety minutes or so later, when we’ve left the room and taken the elevator back down to the lobby. I have expressed some slight embarrassment at checking out from this hotel only two hours after checking in. But no, I say, it’s no big deal, and I hand over the card keys to the woman behind the desk. I was expecting that we were going to cross Brooklyn off our list before going to sleep, but that isn’t what happens. We ride the elevator up to our room with a couple that expresses envy at the Domino’s Pizza we have picked up along the way from Staten Island. We shove the food into our mouths (especially I do). Then we recall suddenly how difficult it can be to move, let alone have satisfactory sexy times after eating a large helping of such foodstuff. But in the morning, of course, we’re back at it with much enthusiasm. “Borough number two!” Andy says enthusiastically after we’ve finished. “Where are we going next?” “Queens,” I say. “Okay. I’ll text my roommates to let them know we’ll be there. ” But before catching the train we go to get some coffee for me. There’s nothing substantial to be eaten at the place we go to, but I feel like sitting with my coffee for a bit. A bird passes outside the window. “Oh, a European starling,” says Andy. “And what should one know about European starlings?” Andy says they don’t really know much about birds, but they happen to be aware that the European starling is an invasive species here, introduced in New York City in a previous century for a terribly ill-conceived celebration in which every bird ever mentioned by William Shakespeare was released into Central Park, dooming most of them to death by inhospitable climate but allowing starlings, who tend to thrive in urban environments, the opportunity to proliferate in a new world. We follow our phones to a street that looks like it will give us several options for a real breakfast. We walk into one place. “They have tablecloths,” Andy says warily as we walk in. I worry that Andy is underestimating my tolerance for nice restaurants and just trying to make sure I’ll be comfortable, but it’s true that the place feels cramped and is not the vibe we’re looking for. I nod and we walk back out. The hostess darts out of the door after us. “I have two spots open at the bar!” she yells. We tell her that’s okay, thanks. Then we come upon another place, Le Petit Café. I only realize when we are seated in the back that I have been here before. Years ago, for breakfast. Because, oh, crap, I guess we’re not too far from the part of Brooklyn where Diane lived, and where Arden and I and Lorenzo stayed that one time. Once we’ve left and we’re walking to catch the train up to Sunnyside, Andy is whistling. “I find it so adorable to watch you walk with this spring in your step, whistling happily. ” “I guess it does say something about my relaxation level and comfort around you,” they say. “I always do this sort of thing when it’s just me walking by myself, but usually around other people I’ll hold that back. Oh, man. Three boroughs to go in our five borough challenge!” They say this last part in a sing-songy voice. “We’re going to make it happen!” I say, raising my hand for a high five. Their hand intentionally misses mine. I laugh. “Is that something you always do when someone goes to high five you? Do you never high five?” They nod. “Yup… But, you know…” (changing the subject) “We should make this a thing. Advertise it, put it on social media. Once people hear about it, everyone will want to do the five borough challenge!” “I can’t believe you’re calling it that,” I say, “A ‘challenge’, like it’s some dare that kids on YouTube would give each other. ” “#FBC. People will be using the hashtag to give each other advice and to tell their stories about trying to complete the five borough challenge. ” One of the amazing things about Andy is that if I jumped in with real plans to monetize the idea of having sex in all five boroughs of New York City in the course of a day, I am not certain that they wouldn’t be on board. It was my recognition in the potential of this part of their personality that made me plan this day, plan it in spite of the fact that ambitious sex romps are not anything most people who know me would expect me to initiate. We get to the subway station at Smith and 9th Street. “This is the tallest subway station in the world,” they say. “It was built to make sure there would be clearance for tall ships coming through, but it wasn’t long after it was built that the need for that clearance dried up pretty much completely. So, now it’s just a super-tall subway station. ” We ride up to Queens. I grab another coffee once we’re off the train, and we walk back to their place. Bernette is in the living room, in pajamas, in the early afternoon. I say hello and lean against the wall as she and Andy share an appropriate amount of light conversation. After this, when Bernette has made her way almost to her room (on one end of the apartment) and Andy and I have made our way almost to theirs (at the other end of the apartment), Andy yells, “Hey! By the way! Do you know what happened to the sex matrix?” Bernette’s response is, “…No,” with an emphasis on the “…”. Andy and I head into the bedroom. Naked on yet another bed, we’re… happy. This doesn’t feel repetitive. This is new again, still. Our next stop will be my room in Manhattan, but before we go there we need to eat. I take them to the Thai restaurant that’s closest to the Y, then we head to my room, and we really are doing this thing, it is clear now, as we get so lost in this. This is really not something I could do with just anyone. How are we making this happen? This idea! This silly, stupid idea! It’s happening! I just keep wanting to do it with them again. We just keep being ready for each other. It’s a story of compatibility that it might never feel entirely appropriate to tell. As I’ve said to them about this day we’re living: “This is a story we’ll tell to… well, we won’t have children, so we’ll have to tell other people’s children about it. Just at a birthday party for someone. People will be like, ‘No! Don’t start telling that story again. ’” Night falls. All that’s left is the Bronx. We take the subway up. We totally have time. Andy has their things with them, so the two of us will be able to spend the night in the hotel and then leave from there to our respective jobs in the morning. Staten Island felt like a hotel in the middle of an empty field, as if the borough surrounding it had gone to buy a pack of cigarettes and never returned. In Brooklyn, if you listened hard enough, you could hear the investment dollars making love to each other and discussing the beautiful children they were going to have. Queens felt the closest of all the boroughs to a community. Manhattan was the borough for people like me—people who take the unfocused wishes of others and direct them upward until they explode like fireworks above and upon a humanity that is tangled, always and irreversibly, out of necessity, into knots of identity. Lastly, the Bronx that we find ourselves in seems to us like shadows in shadows fighting shadows. We check in to our room and drop off our things. “Well, at least this is the largest of the hotel rooms we’ve rented,” I say. There is a bit of an unpleasant odor in the room, a hole in the ceiling, and no towels, but it’s large. As is usual when I enter a room where it is just Andy and me, I am less a person than a polarity: it is like my feet leave the ground and I float to them, fit around them, press against their pressing. We’re both tired, but my body, at least, has adapted to the day’s rhythm. I suggest we get beers along with the food we’re about to grab. “To celebrate,” I say. After walking to the McDonald’s and back, then, I’m sitting on the floor while they sit on the bed, and both of our meals are on the bed. At their suggestion we’re making a list of things we’ve said we’d like to do and places we’ve said we want to visit together. That list is as follows:   Things to Do -Each other -McDonald’s -Museum of Natural History -Transit Museum -Met -Mt Loretto (Staten Island) -Eat duck -Dead Horse Beach -The castle in Central Park (+ Shakespeare Garden) -Flushing (Chinese secret places) -Tattoo -Start FBC empire -Actually watch Broad City   And before we get down to what we have come to this hotel room to do we giddily cuddle and laugh as they talk about the tee shirt they want to make out of something I said earlier, something whose context I almost immediately forgot and which I didn’t find as funny as they did: “I didn’t ask for this boner”. They go on, coming up with more ridiculous shirt ideas based on things we’ve said and talked about over the course of the weekend. It feels like we’re already best friends. It has been four weeks to the day since the two of us met for the first time. Is what we’re doing wrong? I think we are quite good people. What could be wrong about it? When the five borough challenge has been completed, Andy lifts one hand and the two of us high five. Our hands connect. "

    "body": "35 Let’s not write about the morning, our minor issues with the hotel. I go to work, then back to Manhattan. I sleep and wake up and it’s still before midnight. Let’s not write about my scheduling myself forty-five minutes to reply to messages on OKCupid that I’m overdue to reply to. I finish up some of the documents I should have finished writing while I was still at work. I pack. I get to the airport and I transit and the travel is not the big deal this time, it’s not the nexus of my inspiration. Andy. How does this happen? I sit on a plane for many hours. Roll my luggage through the airport. Food and coffee during the layover. This is how it goes. This is how air travel always goes. But this is not how dating always goes. I get on another plane. It is still March and I am still thirty-four years old and I land in California, where the weather is thirty to forty degrees warmer than it has been in New York. Rosalyn has not been well in her mind, in her spirit, although the money she inherited when her mother died has often been going to paying for care of her body—massage, visits to a chiropractor, pool swims—and she says that her chronic pain is less than it once was. She has found someone else (her friend from OT school, whose family she is living with) to take care of; it’s a pattern, she has told me many times, at least in her relationships, that she tends to be the carer and the giver, finding people who need support, who need to be held up. And while I was in OT school she was able to be that to me. But she’s afraid of driving to Los Angeles alone, and she says she has oppressive amounts of homework to do, so she picks me up at the MetroLink station (not leaving the car to find me; staying inside it). She has been uncommunicative with me lately, and I’ve been feeling like I’m being treated as if I were a work colleague from some old job. She doesn’t touch me or want to talk about me, just says she wants to use the pool, so she swims while I read poolside for about fifteen minutes. We sleep, not touching, on a shared bed. In the morning she drops me off at the MetroLink commuter rail and I make the long journey to UCLA. I grab food, then go to the research library and their special collections and look through some boxes of Anaïs Nin’s original journals. I wasn’t sure what to expect from my time in the Special Collections reading room. It could have been an uncomfortable place, could have felt off in any number of ways, but in practice it is delightful. There is a person behind a desk who, when I request one of the boxes I have reserved, goes to another room, gets it, and puts it next to the boxes that the other researchers are going through. And it feels pretty amazing once I’ve pulled out one of the folders and taken it to the seat where I also have my laptop, and once I’ve opened up a journal just like the many I’ve written in over the course of my time on this planet so far and… and… all that I’m looking at is the diary of a life. There is nothing that is any more magical (or less magical) about Anaïs Nin’s diaries than about my diaries, Andy’s diaries, or any other of the diaries I have been privileged to hold in my hands and look through over the years. Nin is maybe not a writer whose works scream out to a wide cross-section of humanity, but she knew the power of narrative in life, in a time when it took vision to imagine one’s story as a book in progress (because actually seeing such a book in its intended form was usually an impossibility). I touch a paperjournal that Nin started, which she and Henry Miller conspired to make the first of a series of distributed diary volumes. There is even a list of subscribers—people who expressed interest in receiving copies of her handwritten diaries as they were written. And oh, the remarks on Marcel Proust. Proust’s novel, although it was not a diary, was an argument for a diary of movement. It is impossible to show respect for the revelations of Proust without setting pen to paper today. Marcel, in search of lost time, regained much, but lamented his absent future. Anaïs had the future, but her past belonged to others—to her father, to her analysts. Yet, if a subjectivity is divorced from time, it grows to its desired size; it lasts as long as we want it to, so that we are always here. After leaving the special collections I eat some food at the campus center. Then I sit at an outdoor table for a while, editing and re-editing a Facebook status update on my phone. As I’m doing this a young guy sits down unnecessarily next to me, wearing sunglasses, and stares at me. I look at him. He slowly starts to turn his head away, then snaps it back quickly. “Hi,” I say. He doesn’t answer. “Ah, I see,” I say. “You aren’t talking. You’re just going to keep staring at me. All right, then. Well. I just finished my Facebook post, so I think I’m going to get up and leave now. ” I imagine there was probably someone with a camera recording us while this happened; it seemed like the setup for someone’s YouTube prank video. That’s what I get for sitting outside in Los Angeles, I suppose. Then it’s a whole big thing getting back to Orange County. I try to Uber to Union Station, but it happens to be rush hour and the Uber driver basically says that it’s going to be at least an hour there no matter what way she drives. So I have her drop me off at the side of the road and I take a bus instead. Then I have to ask around at Union Station to figure out what I’m doing, and I make it to the train, and I’m on the train, and then it’s night and I’m at the Irvine Transit Center. My phone is dying. I wait for twenty minutes, send Rosalyn texts and Facebook messages and gchat messages using my iPad and the transit center’s wifi network. She didn’t confirm that she would be here at this time when I messaged earlier just before my phone died. And twenty minutes go by, with me sitting inside and then outside, and I hear nothing from her, so I take a cab, which costs like thirty-five dollars, and that takes me to the hotel that I got way out here in Orange County only because I thought I would be having quality time with her, and that’s the only reason I would be in Orange County at all, and that’s a long way from Los Angeles, and I waited too long to try to modify my reservations. And when I get to the hotel room Rosalyn texts and says that she’s at the place I just took the cab from. I tell her I’m at the hotel. I’m so annoyed, but whatever. I don’t want to dwell in it. I convince her to go for a walk with me, but we still don’t really talk about anything. It’s just a walk through empty California streets at night. Nowhere is as empty as a California city at night. 36 The next day, Rosalyn drops me off again at the MetroLink. I find my way to downtown Los Angeles, to the Convention Center, to the AWP Conference &amp; Bookfair. And unlike in New York City, the time is moving quickly for me out here in L. A. And I’m enjoying the conference, but I’m not speaking to anyone. Lori Desrosiers, whom I know through the Pioneer Valley, is here. I could easily track her down, but I don’t. My old instructor from Johns Hopkins, Susan Muaddi Darraj, does a reading, because she has won an award for her latest book. I attend, but I don’t stick around to talk to her after. Over the course of the next three days—(I don’t see Rosalyn again on this visit)—although I am having a great time sitting in the audience for various panels and readings, I don’t think I actually speak with anyone except Aimee Bender, the excellent short story author, whom I merely compliment and thank for her autograph when I get it at the bookfair. Over the course of three days I go to a lot, like a couple of panels on queer representation in literature; a panel about the working class in literature; a reading from Northampton’s own Small Beer press (whose Lady Churchill’s Rosebud Wristlet published me); a discussion about publishing in single-poem/single-story formats; a panel about writing education outside of academia; and a reading by Joyce Carol Oates and Peter Ho Davies. 37 I also make a trip out to Largo one night to see the “April Fool’s Day Eve” event by the cast of the now-defunct podcast The Thrilling Adventure Hour. Before the show starts I stand in line for the bathroom behind Adam Savage from the TV show Mythbusters, who also participates in a silly reading of old podcast scripts. 38 And then immediately I’m back in New York. It’s raining. I wake up from my nap and take the bus to the American Museum of Natural History. Andy meets me at the top of the stairs outside. “Come up here,” they say, leading me in through what I guess is the members only entrance. The room with the big, famous whale is blocked off. There isn’t much time before the museum closes. But while looking at placards that have descriptions of different ocean life I see that one is called “bubbleweed” and decide that this could be Andy’s new pet name. “I sort of love that,” they say, and so they are now Bubbleweed. We go to a Starbucks. “Really?” they ask, in disbelief. “The last time we saw each other was the FBC?” Time has sped up. We walk toward the Beacon Theatre. As we wait at a traffic island for the pedestrian light to change, we kiss. A woman who is crossing from the opposite side of the street says to us, “Excuse me! People need to cross. ” We look at where we’re standing—near to each other, appropriately out of the way of the crosswalk, obeying all traffic laws, with no place better we could move to. And since we’re in the right, we just stand there. Once the woman has passed, Andy voices an exaggerated impression of her mean-spirited comment—”Excuse me!”—and it becomes a running joke. I have never seen Liz Phair in concert before, but I have been listening to her since the nineties and even enjoyed the much-trashed self-titled album which spawned her biggest radio hit, “Why Can’t I?” My feeling is that her Girly-Sound tapes are timeless, even if they are now largely forgotten. The Smashing Pumpkins play a range of different songs, some of which I know very well and others of which I have only listened to once or twice. Andy and I ride the subway to their place and in the morning I have my morning class, then I do homework, then in the evening I go to my evening class, then it’s Wednesday and I’m working and I’m supposed to go to dinner with someone from OKCupid I would very clearly have no particular connection with, but when it becomes clear that my work day is going to be long I message her to say that I need to cancel, and she says that she didn’t think it was going to work out, anyway, and that she wishes me the best of luck, and then I go home and sleep, and then I work, and all throughout this work and sleep, I’m texting with Andy, and then it’s Tuesday, April 7, 2016 when they ask if they can call to talk about something. Yes, of course. “Hi,” they say. “Hi!” I say. “It’s nothing too serious, nothing dramatic,” they say, “But, you know how some things just feel better if you can talk about them over the phone?” They say that for these past eight months, or however long it has been since they broke up with their ex, they’ve been dating a certain way—usually “friends with benefits” types of situations—but things between them and me feel like they’re different from that. They have plans tomorrow to meet up with a guy they’ve been hanging out and doing sexual things with, and they’re planning to tell him they need to stop the physical things they’ve been doing while they figure out what they need to figure out. I don’t push for any more details while we’re on the phone; I just thank them for talking to me about this and say it’s assuring to hear that they’re looking out for themselves. I have realized that Cloud Cult would be a good show to suggest that Andy should come to. The band is, as I have described them in text, “a bunch of sweetheart environmentalists from Minnesota who have painters onstage as part of their band and record their albums on an organic farm. ” During the course of Friday, as I’m at work, Andy confirms that they’ll be able to meet up with me and attend the show. With it being at the Bowery Ballroom, they say that I should meet them at a noodle place at the edge of Chinatown. After talking the subway and walking down Bowery, I do. The restaurant is a hole in the wall that they’ve mentioned to me previously. The people waiting on us don’t understand that although both of us order the same thing we are in fact hoping for two meals, not just one. So, Andy’s plate arrives, but mine doesn’t. I say that’s okay and possibly for the best once I’ve tried the food. I’m still unable to tell the difference between freshly-made noodles and the kind one gets in a box and leaves in the pantry for a year; plus, I have a hard time getting the duck meat off the bone. (As a general rule I prefer food that is as easy to convey from the plate to my stomach as possible. ) Just as Andy is finishing their plate, another plate arrives for me. Presumably, someone noticed that I had no food in front of me and asked for the second plate to be made. I say no to it. Finally we’re outside. I apologize for my food weirdness and say that I’ll be more fun to be around now that we’re outside and I can move instead of being trapped in a chair. We’re cute. We’re looking for some quick food for me before the show. We sit at a bench across from the New Museum, which (as Andy needs to point out to me after ten minutes of our sitting across from it) has a big boat suspended in front of it. We decide to get me pizza, but then the line inside the pizza place is very long and Andy asks me if I want to keep looking for someplace else and I say sure and then we walk around and I see some possibilities but actually then realize I would rather go back to that pizza place. Andy gets serious for a moment. “Did you only leave because I suggested it? Levi, with that kind of thing, I don’t ever want you to think I’m trying to get you to change your mind. I just thought you wouldn’t want to wait, because I know you don’t like places where you have to wait in line. ” “I promise you don’t have to worry about that,” I say. “Remember the noodle place we were just at? If I were reluctant to say what I wanted, I would have just kept eating the food instead of saying that you should finish it yourself. ” Then we’re whimsical again, sitting on some sort of crate-looking thing against one of the closed storefronts as I eat the pizza. It’s a lovely night for the two of us, and it continues to be lovely as we get to the Bowery Ballroom and sit in the bar area with drinks until the opening act has finished and we hear that Cloud Cult has taken the stage. We stand next to each other, sometimes holding hands. Andy seems to enjoy the show. They confirm this to me once it’s over, as we sit in the bar area for a bit before leaving. “I’m really glad I didn’t find the time to listen to the band or really find out anything more about them before I came here with you,” they say. “This was amazing. ” And then the night continues forever. We are walking, and I don’t know if we really have any idea where we’re walking to at first, but then we’re in Chinatown. “Everything is shut down by this hour, just like in China,” they say. (They spent a year living in Beijing when they were in college. ) They’ve looked up things on their phone—”If you look in my search history, ‘quiet bar’ will be one of my most common searches,” they’ve said—and after pointing out some restaurants and the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory and a street that they say is “a lot of times, if a movie is going to film a scene set in Chinatown, the street they’ll use”, we walk by a place that came up on the map, but it’s overflowing with people, and so we keep walking. It feels like we might not find anywhere, but New York City rewards its persistent drink-seekers always: we end up at a bar that is perfect for our needs. We pull out a couple of stools and order a single round of drinks (because they’re about to stop serving, although not, they assure us, in a hurry to kick anyone out). And we talk about our relationship—without any discomfort or trepidation that I can sense, but with that combination of humor and candor which is probably the secret to all our compatibilities. Their talk with the other guy they’ve been sleeping with went well. “Levi’s a lucky guy,” the guy said. Andy and I agree that “partners” sounds wrong for us, and so instead, without deliberation, quickly and off-handedly, we decide that we are adventuremates. Things are winding down in this bar and we have finished our drinks, so we step outside. Andy is already on their phone to find our next spot. I smile to see their enthusiasm about continuing our talk. We end up in the back of some moderately busy but shadowy bar, sitting side to side. They tell me things about their past relationships. They say they’ve never told anyone some of these things. It keeps getting later and later. When we’ve been in the bar for a while and our glasses are empty they ask me what I want to do next. I say I get a thrill out of feeling like I’m younger than them, so let’s have one more round before we part ways. We’re usually touching. One hand on another hand, or something like that. It seems they have to stop themselves from saying too forthrightly that this feels—that we feel—like a revelation of what compatibility can be. Everything about us just feels so easy. “At least for now,” they always qualify. "

about here now, and i really can’t rant, but none of is being written as it comes into my head, even though i’m typing it out rather quickly. . it’s kind of like, there’s not as much crap to carry me on. . typing endlessly with the ideas that my stream of consciousness are giving me. .   I’ve always taken each new encounter with a human being as a new challenge for me to actually work on. someone will come into my life, and i’ll be sure that i can actually do something with them, something to help them. . and i’ll be sure that i’m just the thing this person needs to help them through the difficult times they’ve been having (and i kind of realize how really pointless it is to have different chapters in here when the writings are basically all the same, even though i usually plan for the writings to be completely different each time i sit down to type them out). . anyway, i’m also usually quite certain that any female could be a female for me to finally hold onto, for me to be able to comfort, to be comforted by the comforting and to be comforted directly by her. and beautiful is rarely a word that i won’t use within my own mind to destroy the latest one who has entered my life. . eventually i realize the reasons why they couldn’t handle a relationship with me, or why i wouldn’t even want a relationship with them. . but the reasons for that are always stupid reasons that take me back to the crap that is our modern civilization, what it says is right and what it says is wrong. . that it’s something different to have someone to hold onto and someone to love. . that love is something oh-so-difficult to achieve, that there is one person out there for you to love, that everyone else is just a piece of shit that shouldn’t matter to you anyway unless you’re going to donate your fake smiles and your child support to them (which of course you must do, because not doing that is yet another way to solidify your status as an evil hellspawn). i tell you now, that if you are lonely, and if you are tired, if you want peace or if you want disruption, i want to be here for you. . but i can only be here for you if i know that you want me here. if you think i’m a piece of shit, if you think i deserve nothing more than to be laughed at. . if you think my long hair makes me look like a fag, if you think that i’m nothing, that i’ll never accomplish anything, that my writings are so incredibly pointless because they don’t even tell a story, they don’t even have a cast of characters, they’re not even fiction, they’re not even about a typical family in a typical town disrupted by a force that they know nothing of, a force that is so greater than anything they could ever control… well, then, i suppose in that case i don’t want to help you at all. but if you can understand at all, or if you want to understand at all, i hear you, and i understand you, and i want to help you and i want to hold you and i want to love you. and i’ve never found a male whom i’ve desired to hold and i think it’s rather sad. but whether that’s a negative statement about males, females, gods or peasants. . at this point i just don’t know.   I’m not very smart.   I’ve kind of realized just now exactly how stupid i am, just how very… teenaged i am. i know it’s living by the standards set down in front of me, but first of all, i really have to weigh the different ideas that are coming into my head but somehow seem disorganized until i try to settle out their order on paper or on this computer. first of all, everything i’ve come to think and believe about the human race, how people think, how people should live. . all these things have come mostly from observation and careful consideration. i think about that, and i look at exactly how long mankind has been on the face of this planet, and i look at how little they’ve actually managed to determine about themselves, and i really begin to realize that i should find out a little more about others’ considerations before i even make a pathetic attempt to solidify any of my philosophies and ideas by writing them down here. first of all, i’ve tried the categorization of individuals i know, or knew, very little about. . only to find out through further reading and such that i was completely, 100% wrong in my simple assumptions about these people and what they were doing with their lives and what their errors could have been. the errors were truly errors that are often made by humans that i see everyday on the streets, so in the most. . spread out, anticoncentrated way, this was an observation of all. . a simple psychological evaluation, and a true one, simply not of the human being whom i’d initially thought it was applying to. i could try looking at myself and i could try to be unbiased about it, but i would come to the conclusion that i’m exactly the same as everyone else and that i’m not truly an original, that i only long for intelligent conversation with others so that i can listen to what they have to say that sounds reasonably intelligent, and comment on that with similar things i have heard or read about, and then steal the intelligent ideas that came from their mouths and use it the very next opportunity i happen to get to do so. i suppose that when i try to look at myself and describe the kind of person i am. . and i find that i’m so very different from one day to the next, i can look at it in a few different days- i can say that i’m striving to become the greatest adam ares that i can possibly be, i can say that i’m evolving, that all the silly mistakes i make because of my ignorance are corrected with each newfound enlightening thought or idea, or realization that just comes from nowhere because i’m such a damn creative fella. . but, um, i guess that doesn’t really make a lot of sense. because, again, i’m fooling myself…. . i can’t look at the people who really think that i have something to say, who think that what i want is right and that the way i think is right and that if i think others have more profound things to say simply because they’ve been building off of the principals of others (completely ignoring the futility of building off of an idea that appears sound, but has not been built from anything else within one’s mind, but rather being stolen from someone else, seeing that it appears to make sense, judging by the observations and prejudices that one holds as their own), that i’m demeaning myself and what i could possibly accomplish, that i could change this world and that i could make it better. . that the people who just stumble around everyday, the people i see shopping through the sacred halls of k-mart with their 4-year-old toddler on a leash like an inhuman mexican jumping bean that can’t be allowed to do anything but stay by their mother’s side, the people who come to my door and ask if my parents allow me to choose my own reading material before handing me a pamphlet about how we’re gonna rot in hell unless we worship a demystified version of hitler in the way that only their religion can do, are the very same ones who push the idea that building off of your own ideas and your own ideas only is a stupid, juvenile thing to do and makes you an egotistical bastard with no regard for the omnipotent skeleton of our modern day society. . that these people are silly weenies and that we are the power, we are the power. . we. . are. . the. . and then i look around for a moment and i see that i’m standing underneath an undetermined light source in an otherwise empty dance hall, dark as pitch, with the stench of bad cologne wreaking havoc on my olfactory nerves. i call out the name of anyone, of everyone, and there’s no response except for my own hoarse voice as it returns to me with a long-dead fig leaf that doesn’t effect me the way i might have previously predicted it would. i look at all the people who might agree with me, and come up to me in the mall and ask me sign their pet donkey so that they might sell him for the money to buy an antidote for my beliefs. and i look at all the people who were racing with forrest gump with such a determination, as they declare that forrest gump, in his silence, is the reborn messiah. and i decide to stop my running, and i decide to turn around, and i tell them all to go the fuck home…. and i walk on my own for a little as a small raincloud opens above my head. and i walk through a park that i’ve never seen before in my life, and it’s surrounded by forested areas, and i begin to feel soaked to the bone and i love it more than i’ve ever loved anything before in all the years of my existence. . and i sit down alone on a park bench and i think to myself and i wonder if i look as cool as trent reznor would as i sit here considering what might happen to my future, to my past, to my everything. . and i pull out a laptop computer that i don’t really have in real life, and i log onto america online but i don’t actually have any mail, and my buddylist is empty, and i throw the computer into a puddle and i look up at the raincloud but see somewhere above it a light that’s shining down on me, or attempting to, through the raincloud. i consider it for only a brief moment, however, before just deciding that it’s not worth it and walking around a bit around the children’s play area. i touch the wooden structures designed for young ones to climb on, and i feel the cold dampness of the rain-soaked see-saw… i see no children on the playground but i feel the lovely desolation and the wonderful misery. i smile for a second as i realize just how much i’m reveling in this nonsense and this crap. i walk into a nearby bookstore and i see my latest bestseller sitting next to “chicken soup for the soul part 10: chicken soup goes hip-hop”. and i play with my hair a little bit and i see the people i’m used to seeing in k-mart again. only this time they’re here, and they’re buying a couple dean koontz books for the only friend of theirs who didn’t get good grades in high school, who ironically is also the only friend who actually enjoys reading anything. and i suck on my thumb for a little before i walk back home and just go to sleep because i couldn’t find anything else to think about in any sort of a semi-meaningful fashion. and i hate it all again, because reality is such a curse when you try to avoid it by trying to find it.   i have some friends. but i can never truly respect them nearly as much as i can respect myself. because they like me. and i could never truly like myself. because i come so close to violating the sanctity. of what is. myself.   I used to think that i was a cynic, because i hated and despised most of the people around me. then i became enlightened to the fact that my self-glorification makes me an idealist.   I’m not writing with my muscles clenched, and i’m not having my train of thought interrupted every couple of seconds by someone asking another stupid question or dismissing everything that i could ever love and cherish and consider worth living my life for with a “pssh! whatever!” and that stupid hand gesture that you see everybody doing on ricki lake. i’m just. . alone. i only go to school for first period now. . and i’ve only started doing that because my mother got a phone call from the vice principal saying that if i didn’t start coming to school they would have to send a truant officer after me. . and i really don’t need that kind of garbage getting in the way of my life at this point. this is really the most stable i’ve been in awhile. . i don’t know what this is now. i really just have nothing to do and nothing to complain about, nothing to love and nothing to hate, and i’m not even bored with it. i don’t know what exists in my life now besides my vague impressions of the future that i see inside my head… and i could complain that perhaps living like this is just living for the future, something that isn’t now, and i could say that that makes me a horrible hypocrite and that i hate myself. . but, really, i don’t even feel that now. and if i can’t even criticize myself, then wow, what an interesting state that makes me in now. . well, not interesting for these writings, at all, but instead interesting for myself. . because it’s uncharted territory and it’s really a difficult thing for me to even guess where i might end up next. i mean, before there’d always been desire, there’d always been that silly pursuit of the child of beauty, sitting there on what i’d always perceived as the twilight. . but then what was supposed to be starlight instead just turned into a new dawn for myself… the same dawn that i’d experienced several times before. because i reached the child of beauty, and i saw that she wasn’t as beautiful as i’d imagined she would be. and i saw that the child of beauty was not what i wanted, what i needed to lead me away from what i’d been whining about in my repetitive rants about how it was everyone else and how darn stressful it was for me to stand up in front of the world with a romance novel in hand and declare that i was god. and then. . then i found the world that the child of beauty was but a shadow of. . and that was the greatest outlet i could ever have imagined. . and it helped me with a lot. . but left a huge, gaping hole in what i’d started with these writings. . because i can no longer sit here and write about how i want to kill maim slaughter and how i want to love hug hold dear. . because. . um. . i don’t really want anything now. it’s kind of neat when i look at the way life actually tends to hold onto the essential plot elements, if you look at it the right way.   I’ve known roxanne online for even longer than i’ve known sarah. she’s another friend left over from the good old days when everyone in the smashing pumpkins room knew each other and could laugh and just fool around, and if an idiot came in we could just laugh at them and get them pissed off enough so that they’d leave. . of course, now that there are so many more people on america online, the smashing pumpkins room has kind of become the last place to go to look for true, intelligent fans of the band. but anyway, roxanne somehow met up with steve, my friend in real life, and the two eventually hooked up. um, the only problem with this was that steve felt. . i don’t know. . embarrassed, i guess. . about the entire situation. and so they didn’t tell me about any of this. i just had to learn about it through word of mouth, mostly sarah. even when they arranged to meet in real life, and have roxanne spend a week over at steve’s house, they didn’t tell me. at all. on the second day when she was there, though, cathy and i were on our way walking to the mall, and decided to stop in to see steve. cathy knew that roxanne was there, but had been instructed not to tell me. i knew that she was there, but i didn’t feel that it would be a good idea to start a conversation about it, because i knew the fact that i wasn’t supposed to know she was over would come up. . and. . well. . i don’t know. anyway, we went over there, and steve stood at the door for a minute before reluctantly letting us into his room, where roxanne was sitting down, staring at the floor. steve sat down on the couch, and then we all just kind of. . sat there. roxanne refused to even look at me, and steve wouldn’t say a word. cathy made an effort to start some conversation, but nothing happened… eventually i just said “fine, thanks for the warm welcome”, and left with cathy. i don’t like the feeling of not being trusted. . i don’t know if steve felt that i wouldn’t… understand. . or that i felt that he should be incapable of actually caring for someone. . or that i would feel strangely about the fact that they’re both my friends. . if there’s one thing i’d like to think is obvious, it’s my understanding of other people. . so obviously i wouldn’t. . make fun of them or anything… anyway, i just felt kind of betrayed in this situation. . well, maybe not betrayed. . using the word “betrayed” kind of leads one to infer that i felt i could assume a certain level of trust from steve. . but it’s really not that. . it’s just that i’m disappointed, because this proves he doesn’t feel he can share at all with me. . which has kind of been one of the major things i’ve tried to help him with, throughout our friendship. . but still, how can one be taught to trust someone he doesn’t trust when he can’t trust them that they’re trustworthy?… the next day they apologized and invited me over… i said i would get them out of the house, since they hadn’t actually done anything. . we walked to the mall and they remained quiet. . steve seemed even quieter than usual… i think it’s sad that they both refuse to make their own little world a part of everything else…   My determination is gone, and yet so are my feelings of futility. i don’t feel that i’m so miserable now, that i actually have anything to gain from putting my all into any one thing, as i thought i had done with my ideals of accomplishing things in this world and making it a better place for myself to live in. i’m happy, but more importantly i’m content. and i suppose the different parts of myself shown in this book should feel bitter contempt for certain other parts, but i guess i’m not a hypocrite, even as i’m contradicting my previously stated claims that i am. i just. . i just change. a lot. and if i can change so much, i guess that kind of shows that maybe we should all just pack our things and go home. maybe the show’s all over and we have nothing to gain from continuing to toy around with the silly ideas that we once had. . but still i feel the child that’s within me, and i still feel the same way that i always have. i still refuse to live life the way that people will tell me to directly. . but maybe in that i’m just like most human beings anyway. maybe i’m just like the people who stormed the bastille but still believed in jesus christ. maybe i’m controlled by my hatred towards authority… but no. . no, it’s not that. . because i don’t try to contradict the rules set down upon me. . i simply refuse to live by them. but still, that’s nonetheless defiance. . no, that’s living life the way i want to, free of outside influence. . no, no. . it’s. . ah, screw it, i don’t know. and the sad fact of the matter is that i don’t care anymore. i’m like an addict who’s just had his fix. what am i now? what have i become?

    "body": "alice in wonderland. how do you get to wonderland? over the hill, or here or there? i wonder where… wouldn’t it be nice to visit wonderland? i think to myself as i sit in my room with the light turned off simply for the added effect of scary, all-encompassing darkness- a weak attempt that doesn’t work at all, thanks to the blinding whiteness of the computer screen in front of me- a whiteness i could change if only i really cared about it enough to do such a thing. i think back to my third grade play, when i played the white rabbit, and i was so incredibly certain that i was always doing a wonderful job and that i was really really talented and that i felt right at home onstage. i didn’t even think of myself as a pathetic nervous freak as i stood there on stage that day, but that’s exactly how i appeared. down my shirt was stuffed a pillow to give myself a belly, which i didn’t really understand, since the white rabbit, to the best of my knowledge, had never been portrayed as especially fat. this pillow kept slipping and falling, and every few seconds i would be playing with it, trying to keep it up. . other than that i just stood there, staring blankly into the audience, not actually paying any attention to what any of them were doing, but living in the odd haze that i was always living in back in those days- when i wouldn’t grow bored, when i wouldn’t be thinking of all the better things that i could be doing with my time… i simply existed as i stood there at the front of the stage, and the play went on behind me. . and i listened for when my next part would come up, and i would say my lines but not really care, and i never even thought for a second that i was doing anything wrong. i still remember a lot of the songs from that play… even a few of the parts that i spoke. it never held any significance for me then. . it was just a silly play. . based on a silly movie… right? i never would have suspected that i could ever write anything like this. . even though i’d always wanted to be a writer. . i think i always just pictured myself writing bestselling novels, instead of just sitting here in my room with nothing at all except my stupid, juvenile mind and a computer and all sorts of hyperactive energy that never seems to die down. of course, nothing like this has ever been written, to the best of my knowledge, and just when i become familiar with a style i always feel drawn to just crushing it and seeing what i have left over. i am not going to be a writer. i’m going to be a computer programmer, and i’m going to spend long nights working, and my life is going to be hell. . but i’m going to come home some time, and i’m still going to have the energy and the emotion and the humanity to type these things out. . if not things like this, they’ll be things… things. . things. . anything that i can put myself into. i don’t have to write about myself to write about myself…. because i don’t want to write about myself because it can be…. so. . painful. and my eyebrows sink to the floor and my face tightens up and it all concentrates itself into my brow and the area between my eyes. and again i’m reminded that i simply don’t know how to cry. but i don’t know how to let myself free, either. . free of all these voices that you, too, can now hear, free of all that which people can beg to me not to wish to destroy. . things that i can’t even convince myself i truly wish to destroy. i think i want a wonderland. i started my writing of this section with the assumption that i was ready to turn myself upside down and inside out and say that i’m really a lobster named misanthropic and that i’ve just had you fooled all along. . that like the young boy who i once was, who i will always be, that i’m just the greatest manipulator in the history of all mankind… i want to have. . i want to…. have. i’ve never really wanted. . much. cathy was over today and i began drifting off into sleep until she all of a sudden questioned me about the things i’ve said about antireason. and i tried telling her that it was for her to figure out herself, but she didn’t want to. . she wanted me to tell her. and i told her that it was nothing but just one of my pointless ways of looking at emotion. . and determination. but as i spoke about these things, and as i tried to make myself sound reasonably intelligent. . i fell into a rabbit hole. i fell into a rabbit hole hole and i fell for a mile for a mile for several thousand fucking miles. and i hit rock bottom and i suddenly decided that my fall was a metaphor for something greater, something that i’d have to figure out later on because i had some more meaningless things to give meaning to on the other side of the room. for on the other side of the room sat a table. and on that table was a naked girlie and she was dancing but she was falling several times and she didn’t have very large breasts but she was clutching a book whose title i couldn’t exactly make out and she was in danger and she was crying out for help but she was also simultaneously cooking bacon on a stove that didn’t actually exist. tied to her ankle was a tag reading, “do not open until xmas. ” christmas christmas christ was born and i wanted him to die a more painful death but that just wouldn’t make me happy enough because again i have no clue and again i have no dice and again i’m only just typing as catharsis of the stuff of life of the stuff of lap lap lap lick lick antireason. and i’m not baking a cake for anyone but myself, and sometimes i don’t feel that i’m up to the responsibility of sitting in front of the oven all day waiting for the fucking cake to be done when the oven’s not even on because the oven doesn’t even have an “on” switch. i really started thinking that i could cloud my mind with weenies, roast them on what’s burning up inside. burning up the inside of my own mind is the angst-ridden sanctuary of nothingness… i haven’t been disappointed by anything, and i’m not being overwhelmed by loneliness. . i’m only being overwhelmed by the fact that my only outlet, and the only thing that i really have to live for in the present right now are these writings. and i am hoping to visit soon, and as i lie there bleeding i will have my tongue in a nicer place, and a nicer home, and i will learn to love the… why can’t i have her and why do i want her (because you don’t want anything else. everything has become so monotonous and pointless that you fear you will become the 9 to 5 working scumbag whom you’ve always despised so much. you make yourself sick with your delusions of grandeur and your delusions of self-depreciation. being with her gives you something to take away the pain, while writing only brings it out as a manifestation, and you write these words until you tire yourself out and you collapse onto the floor writhing with the agony of being unconscious). . thank you, i was curious about that. how much of my life will be spared as i go onto college? will i become famous and have all these silly rants published, as i am the billy corgan of writing and as if i keep going at this rate i’ll have to get a bigger hard drive just to keep all of my writings about the same old nothing that i really shouldn’t be worried about at all. oh, such boring monotony is killing others. and i want to lick the soft fabric that is pieces, fragments, being held together as teresa repeats herself about how she’s leaving and how it disrupts the fabric the fabric the fabric that i’ve established, piecing together the things that people have complimented me on and using them as what i decide is important, because the only thing that’s important in my my life is everyone else because what the fuck do i have to offer to myself and i can only truly be independent as i rot in my early grave and cathy floats off into space on her hunk of granite screaming that i am forever lost forever lost everybody’s lost just waiting to be found but they don’t want to be found who wants to be found, because it’s so wonderful to hold a secret to oneself that no one else knows but i have no secrets i have no secrets and i have no why and the toasters don’t know what the fuck they’re doing now and they don’t know where their cords are and they don’t know what they’re in and they don’t know why they smell so badly but they do know that it’s love and they do know that they said that before but it doesn’t really matter anyway because this time it’s different this time it’s different this time it’s corrupted at the earliest age by the eternal conglomerate organic sheets with the fucking cuss words disrupting the flow of everything else which is oh so much fucking more civil because it’s so much better to contemplate suicide than it is to fuck on top of a washing machine at the nearing washing machine clean-o-mart thingie where they have for a quarter for a dollar for your eternal soul the happy liveyourlifebyme thingie that says “cleanliness is next to godliness”. she said, “i’m death and you are life. you are my everything, and i would be something if i wasn’t everything but i still can’t help but think of it as nothing now. ” and steve and roxanne are much nicer, cleaner children than sarah and i because they didn’t plan their visit behind the backs of their parents and they actually kept their clothes on because they’re better because they can’t even fucking talk to me because hell, what do i know anyway, all i would say would be that i think steve’s nothing because he’s so quiet and he’s just a cute little coathanger to carry around. . ack! how can i be thought of as being so shallow? oh well, i guess only time will tell as i get cussed at about how i keep talking about people in here and about how i make up my own stories about the way reality goes and the way others think even though i don’t really know any of this stuff for myself because i’m nothing but a dumbass punk teenager and fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck so fucking foul-mouthed because hey, you have nothing more profound to say, didn’t you just say you got sick of philosophy which you only liked because you were experiencing boredom which you were only experiencing because of ecstasy which you were only feeling because of misery which you were only feeling because of millions of years’ worth of evolution all coming together and falling apart in front of millions of people in their homes staring blankly at the television set, shoving tv dinners into their already-stuffed mouths and drinking milk because it does a body good. there is no such thing as contentedness. contentedness is only the lack of emotion, a natural result of getting rid of it all in one way or another. . and contentedness is boring, it’s just. . nothing, it’s just. . sitting there in your chair and being kind of happy-bouncy but then looking around and realizing that you have nothing to even accomplish with all that happy-bouncy energy. wow. i mean, all i’ve been talking about is how i’m just going to keep working on making myself happier until i’m content with my happiness… but for that i would have to have faith. because to be content, and to know that you won’t have to work any more to become happier, one always has to believe that nothing will change. one has to have faith that the love of their life will not leave them and that they will be able to live on a pretty farm out in the country and make love and make love even when they’re old and 90 and they’ve removed the mirrors from the house, not because they find themselves ugly but because mirrors are a sign of vanity and vanity is an evil satanic thing that has no place in such a wonderful place of happiness, the sanctity of a nice house with a cool porch to sit in on breezy spring mornings, watching the grass blow and the cows be cows and hearing the gunshots in the distance but not really caring because you know they would never be mean enough to try and hurt you or your wife or your dog rover. heh. so is that to be my future? is that all that i’ve worked so hard for? am i just going to give up all my silly dreams of independent thought and being myself and never truly holding any beliefs because belief is not to notice, belief is just some faith? if i am to be happy, i will. because the final answer is ignorance is bliss. and i hang my head and i cover up my face and i brush aside the people trying to block my way from the dressing room and i sit there and i look in the mirror and i look at my eyebrows and i stare into my eyes but they just don’t care for themselves and when i try to make some contact with myself i just spit in my own face and i watch it slowly slide down the mirror and i’m glad that my reflection, my shadow isn’t actually myself because it’s so damn hollow and in reality i’m a lot more charming, obviously, since no one finds me ugly but this reflection that i stare at is the ugliest thing i’ve ever had the misfortune to look upon. go drown in your own piss, you fucking oysters.

    "body": "Paper Clips: The Next Generation adam bit his lip as he stood at the ledge. how did he know this was the right thing to do? why forsake uncharted territory and instead regress into something whose meaning had been crushed so very long ago? somewhere inside his head a voice called out the answer: “revival. ” there was no way of telling how deep the chasm would be. . and he had no idea where he would wind up after a journey such as this. what kind of twisted form could the bottom of this gorge possibly manifest itself as? there was only one way to find out, he said to himself. and he leapt. from off of the pedestal he leapt, all the while trying to keep relatively certain that the camera was still on him, watching his every movement against the ever-increasing wind. he spread out his arms and his legs into a star-like formation, and the fierce flapping of his garments managed to show him just how turbulent the wind was now becoming. he glaced downward, hoping to find a bottom, but none was in sight. his acceleration grew all the more intense, until suddenly… “NEVER FEAR!” adam felt himself get snatched up in midair by something large, purple, and blurry. “oh, god, no. ” “YES! ‘Tis I, Superblob, defender of everything not-bad, and not-defender of everything bad!” Adam felt his mind, his ego, everything he’d been working for, suddenly sink into some obscure backwater region of his abdomen. . somewhere between his gall bladder and his liver. “Why. . ” he choked on the words. “Why have you come here?” “Why, to save you, of course!” “to save me from myself? to save me from finally attempting to find myself, and through finding myself, make a difference in this world, and accomplish something? to serve as yet another pathetic manifestation of all the silly, pointless ignorant waste that i’ve been trying to renounce through all these recent writings?” Superblob gave Adam a strange look. “Er, no, actually. . I’m here to save you from the paper clips. ” “…paper clips. ” Adam thought about this for a second. “somehow, that seems disgustingly appropriate… being the bottomless pit of content ignorance that it is…” “Bottomless Pit of Content Ignorance?!” exclaimed Superblob, “You’ve REALLY mixed up your stories here! That’s the Finite Pit Of Inevitable Death By Muliple Excrutiatingly Painful Stab Wounds Inflicted By Millions Upon Millions Of Paper Clips Bent On Multiverse Domination!… also known as The Bad Place!” “I. . see,” said Adam. but he didn’t see. . he didn’t see at all. and that was the problem. all he could see of the paper clips were what they represented in his own little world. . and perhaps the saddest part of it all was the fact that he knew this and understood this…. but that he felt himself helpless… helpless though he knew that it was impossible to be helpless. . he knew that he could change it all if he wanted to. . but helpless to the fact that he didn’t want to change this. . that. . that… adam suddenly heard a piercing, high-pitched squeal in his ears. he began to lurch about this way and that, immune to the fact that the arms of a purple blob were the only things keeping him from the certain death that awaited him below. “what of it, though?” he asked himself aloud. . “is death really that undesirable for me?” “why? why?! WHY?!” he screamed, and reality was broken, shattering like glass. . it shattered. . and the pieces fell… and adam fell… and adam for once didn’t shrink himself down to the size of the tiniest conceivable organism. . instead he said to himself, “reality is shifting! it’s the work of the evil sorceress appointed by…. ” the earth shook. “THE QUEEN OF HEARTS!” dramatic mood music blasted through the loudspeakers of life. existence slowed itself down to the fastest speed it could find in the phone directory. “einstein was wrong,” said a voice. “he believed that even thought could not travel more quickly than light. . but what light is there in this world, this reality, as you plummet not at 9. 8 meters per second, but rather so much more quickly that it becomes impossible that you could have been falling for so long without being on the complete opposite end of the universe? and how, you ask, is it possible that such a thing could occur without things looking completely different?” the clouds that had previously not been existence suddenly came into existence. . existence not only in the present but also in the past. . only for the past howeverlongadamhadbeenfalling they had now become oddly-shaped clouds, clouds that spelled out words, but never in any linear fashion. . no, for no photograph could ever picture any symbolic meaning in these clouds. . it was only the speed of adam’s descent into monosyllabic obscurity that showed for certain the words spelled out by these words. . and the words spoke at him these words: “deus. ex. machina. ” was it persistence of vision? was it creativity slash insanity slash divine inspiration slash witchcraft that was doing this to him? either way it was a truth that only he could know. and this brought a smile to his face as he saw the clouds change in front of his eyes… they changed into the shape of. . a picket fence. it stood about six feet tall, and on the other side stood a man. adam tried to make out the man’s features through the fence, but failed. the hand motioned now to a point far down the fence that had only been several feet in length before, which now stretched out for miles into the horizon. several meters down was the body of tim “the tool man” taylor, impaled on the picket fence. adam smiled once again. the fence which had been stationary but a moment before now began slowly to revolve. . adam’s position in space did not change at all, nor did the relationship of any of the parts of the fence, nor did the position and stance of the man who stood behind it. slowly but surely, the other side of the lawn was revealed. the man behind the fence wore a long, flowing cape and a mask over his bearded face. above his head floated a halo of light, and upon his head rested two horns. as soon as the significance of this set in for adam, the being melted into the grass without so much as a word. the fence faded away into nothingness, leaving no reminder of what once had been there. adam could not tell anymore where what had once been on either side of the fence now rested in this new world order. he merely sighed with understanding, and proceeded to ask: “why. have i not yet seen what is yet to be seen?”   m y v oyeur f lails how can you NOT understand what i say what i scream what i ALWAYS have wanted you to know to understand even as i never understood it for myself

think that i can do something with it, when i don’t care if i can do nothing with it, for what is accomplishment in comparison to the monolith that towers over me? i don’t know how to explain the

all as a simple idol of my past, forever there to guide me. . to tell me: “this can never be worth it again. ”     i understand the similarities, just how silly, how pointless, the dead, the dead, i

rice as is the bog of eternal stench   BURST the bubble filled not with air but with water.   _____during the early days of my exploration of the internet, i spent most of my time wandering around the web, looking through sites for whatever i found myself interested in. . very early on, i found myself a friend, tricia dunn, through the bulletin boards on the prodigy network. the free trial months offered by the various services allowed me to taste each and decide for myself which i like. . at the beginning i stuck with prodigy, for the bulletin boards and $30 for 30 hours pricing (which back then was a pretty good deal), and america online, for the things that could be found on its network and not on the rest of the internet (most of which i’ve since stopped caring about), and, of course, the easily-accessable chat rooms. back then, i’d never heard of irc, so as far as i knew, aol and prodigy were the only services that offered this… and prodigy’s chat rooms were disgusting, so i didn’t even bother trying there. for awhile even on aol i never really found anywhere to fit in, seeing mostly teen chat rooms with people screaming about how much their favorite band kicks ass… eventually, one evening, though, i came across a folder on the intro screen to keyword: internet. i forget exactly what attracted me to it, but it was ferndale. i followed the link to its web site and read a bit. . it seemed rather interesting, it was an online, rather off-beat, soap opera that was interactive in that people playing the characters would follow a schedule and chat on aol. anyway, i went to the chat room and had a decent time, and enjoyed myself… so i started coming back again on a regular basis. i was offered a free overhead account on aol in exchange for keeping watch over the chat room, which i graciously accepted. anyway, this continued on for a little bit, until ferndale just suddenly went kaput… so that was that. one of the people i’d met there, susan (lilymouse1), i still talked to for awhile afterwards… anyway, around this time i dropped my prodigy account and got a netcom account for some reason… (now i use it so that i don’t have to put up with all the crap that comes with being on aol, particularly people instant messaging me)… and then one day i decided to go into the smashing pumpkins chat room on aol… there the first night were billygurl (maria), geethissux (roxanne), and spfreekbc… now, these people were so. . fun. . they weren’t nearly as mindless as the teen chat crowd, but they were a lot younger, more hyper, and open to a lot more possibilities than the people from ferndale had been. . so it just seemed like a really neat place for me. what was happening in that room was. . interesting. silly talk of “oh, i’d like to be billy (corgan, of the smashing pumpkins)’s pants” and such eventually turned into assignment of clothing items to different people. original, spfreeakbc was the pants. . i don’t remember many other articles of clothing, so that’s not really important. . i wasn’t really interested in being an article of clothing, so i just stuck to being myself, but eventually i was given the title of d’arcy’s bra (which i never went by)… anyway, these titles eventually became actual, well, substitute names for the different sp room regulars. . back then america online wasn’t as crowded as it is now, so as i began to spend more and more time online, eventually it would seem that i would literally know almost every person that i would meet in the room. this led into the summer of 1996, which i spent almost entirely on aol. throughout the course of this summer i solidified myself as the personification of the smashing pumpkins room… however, roxanne very much wanted to feel like she was in control of the situation, a supreme leader not to be messed with…. and so, well, i had no problem with that, really. unfortunately, what had happened was that spfreekbc (whose name had changed into spfreakbc) had been off of aol for awhile, and roxanne had stolen her title as The Pants, which had become somewhat of a sacred title under roxanne’s control. no one ever really knew her as roxanne, she was just The Pants. obviously, she held onto this title as something close to her. . so when freak came back a little later, insisting that she was The Pants (a title which she had a valid claim to), roxanne wouldn’t give in. this was more than a name to her, it was a position of power, the likes of which she’d never held before. so eventually freak gave up on this (and also stopped visiting the room on any sort of a regular basis), leaving roxanne to enjoy her position as the one and only Pants. as a particularly unstable person, however, this didn’t end roxanne’s sudden fits of anger and insecurity. . she’d come in the room screaming that we all hated her and talked about her behind her back (which of course wasn’t true)- the people who saw her in this state and didn’t know her otherwise began hating her… which of course didn’t help her at all… more than once i had to calm her down when she’d begin to talk about killing herself and such. anyway, to backtrack quite awhile. . not long after i began hanging out in the sp room i met sarah. the first time i remember talking to her, she seemed really really amused by the fact that my teddy bear was named pancreas… the next time we talked, she simply started to scare me with all sorts of sexual talk. . “take your pants off there,” she wanted me to do on the second night i knew her. . at first i just thought “wow, she’s really wacky. ” then, one day, roxanne was having a particularly bad night. she announced that she was disbanding the Schlong Family (which had become our name, simply because of one of the early days, where some people who had come to the sp room were upset by the fact that everyone was talking about schlongs, and had moved to another room. . where everyone went and started yelling “schlong!”. . myself, never finding any particular pleasure in harrassing others, just made a room called “schlonging pumpkins”. . after that evening, “SCHLONG!” became our battle cry). . anyway, to get back to the story, roxanne announced that the Schlong Family was no more, and that she now hated everyone, and that she wanted no part of us from this point on…. so what happened was that roxanne, sarah, some others and i went to a private room to talk this over. eventually i got around to talking about how we’d all been living under the guises of these pieces of apparel, that we really weren’t exposing much of our true selves, etc. . anyway, roxanne found herself feeling better, but then suddenly sarah was upset. “what you were just saying to roxanne makes such sense. . i can’t believe i’ve been treating you like you’re not human,” she was saying, “i feel like shit… it must’ve been so hard for you to put up with”. . of course, i hadn’t given it a heck of a lot of thought, i definitely wasn’t upset by the way she’d been treating me. . at most, i simply couldn’t really respect her for anything, because it all seemed so. . fake, so pointless… she vowed from that day to be a completely different person… and from then on most of the articles of clothing gave up their names voluntarily…. what happened with sarah after that point was, first of all, that it was very apparent how hard she was now trying to please me. it was the same thing she’d been doing while she was speaking about overtly sexual stuff, only she was now playing to what she thought i needed, which was just someone nice to talk to… without any of the dirty stuff. at first, i didn’t like this at all. . but the subtleties in the way she was, well. . um. . eventually it seemed we’d become an online item. why had i given into this? well. . i really think it was her persistence… eventually i just couldn’t stand it any longer. . here was someone, i thought to myself, who could actually love me and be there. . at this point in my life, i was lonelier than i’d ever been. . almost every night i would find myself wishing for nothing more than a hug. . i just didn’t want to feel alone. . so it became official. sarah and adam were “together”. the first section of the first part of the first book in this thingie is (in rather random order) what happened during this time. it seemed marvelous to me at first, never having had any significant other, or even a caring friend…. but then… then it just… faded……. . i really didn’t know why back then, but. . well…. it seemed now that any word i said could hurt her. . it seemed like i had to watch every word i said. . it seemed like suddenly i was obligated always to express my feelings for her in certain ways, to act a certain way, to be a certain somebody for her simply because her insecurities were being exposed to me, saying “i know that you’ll make me feel better with every word that you say. i know you won’t harm me. i believe in you… i believe in you. . ” and yet it wasn’t me who was being believed in… the nice feelings of being cared for faded away, and it seemed all that was left was the responsibility. . also, perhaps the biggest factor was the fact that we had never met each other. . all we ever did was talk (constantly) online and also quite a bit on the telephone (which my mom didn’t like, even though she was the one who always caused me, so that there would never be a phone bill on this end. . she didn’t like the entire idea because 1. she was 18 and in college, and i was 15 and in high school… 2. she’d found a snail mail letter that sarah had written me back when she was, well, slutty. . which basically begged me to “fuck her brains out”…). so, one evening, i decided to end it. i told her the way i was feeling about things, i told her that i didn’t love her… i wasn’t doing it in any sort of a harsh way, i didn’t insult her, i didn’t want to see her hurt. . i was just being honest… soon she’s telling me that she just got back from the hospital, is feeling sick, and has been throwing up… what to say to someone who vomits at the thought of your not loving her? i just said that okay, i still loved her, but was feeling overpressured by the entire “relationship” thing…. at least through this she was able to stick to her idea that there was still a chance we could amount to something…. from this point on it was more like we were just friends. . she’d withdrawn and given me space, so things were more or less okay from this point on. we had been planning for her to come and visit me in march of 1997, so we kept to that plan and went along with it. through sarah, i also found out that steve, my real life friend who had just recently gotten back on aol, had fallen in love with roxanne, and that she would be visiting him the week after sarah was visiting me…. but steve felt uncomfortable telling me this, so he told everyone not to let me know about it… but that he would probably tell me when she arrived.   _____during their youth, males are considered by default to be scum. forced to destroy everything that’s been solidified as their own personality in order to be accepted by anyone at all. they know nothing about friendship, they forever must continue their search for “what do i believe in? i need to find what i believe in, then it’ll be Truth”. . they’re used to compromising themselves, eventually there’s no self left in them. . they seem so false, so phony to me, all the time… which is why i tend to feel very frustrated around them. they don’t develop the emotional response that dictates good and bad like females do, instead they react the way they believe they should react. .   during their youth, females are considered by default to be perfectly fine. they tend to have people to fall back on, one friend or another. . allowed to act the way they want, but if they break certain boundaries they’ll be suddenly turned on and have what once was a friendship reduced to nothing… yet still having other friends to say that they were meanies anyway. having real friends, unlike males, and being able to turn on another in a moment, their friends become the only real special thing to them (“oh, everything’s so hectic and confusing, but you’re my friend and you understand”), and when, for an example, a guy breaks up with this friend, the friend who was broken up with is sad… seeing one side of the story, getting used to there being only one side of the story, seeing sadness as bad and happiness as good, not seeing the intentions or the means, but rather letting the emotions effected by the ends dictate what’s good and what’s bad. also, seeking stability in relationships: wanting to feel certain that they will forever be Right makes them happy. Truth within a relationship, if saddening, is “bad”, and therefore has no place in it. Unconditional love? On the receiving end. On the giving end, the guy’s used to this, giving what he thinks he should give, feeling how he thinks he should feel…   _____you know how it is when you have far too much energy to remain awake don’t you? a sponge afraid of water until he finds it and accepting reluctantly the truth of his nature under the                       one           condition that he destroy what he once considered plausible for it is now forever for now obsolete. i am certainly not happy, and yet what have i become now? have i reached the opposite of the once of the ever for then for no longer? to accept it with grace that i know. and. therefore must. puzzle the rest of the world and myself and behind it all hide that myself is a being, emotions and flailing around as i fall it’s a pit that i’m falling through how and the why and the ack once again??? why. must. i. think. i. must? …why must i be? whatever happens as my fingers fall off? oh, once again… my head pounds and it’s based in the flow of it all once again and i’m NOT myself for i have no self. . what is self. . who am i? another me has taken over. i’m the one who wants to know WHY but i don’t want to know it and i FEEL LIFE i saw her dancing in a bar one fine night down by the bay and i felt a sudden pain in my spine and my spine has decided to abandon all metaphors as it SHATTERS into a million fragments and i wonder. where. all the fiction. has gone.

DREAM that it shall not be forever like this, but TIME is always beating you up when you realize that the deal has become rotten and that you are sacrificing a dear part of yourself so that you can buy some mcdonald’s to add onto your already chubby body! wish that you never had it, thanks to the indecision of YES and NO and YES and NO and realize how sad it is to move to budge to ever question babbage for LA LA LA high pitched tone maths ALL more than language ever, dictated so NONINTUITIVELY by our MINDS… we think we can trust our mind’s reason, but LOOK WHAT’S TELLING US THAT! a martian weighs a turkey baster over an incredibly happy leech and thinks the choice is obvious but my reasoning differs quite a bit in those regards…. you poetic scoundrel, how nonupset how nononononononnopg. i’;’ WONDERFUL reality might be but you’re fucked up with the needle of your mind injecting its contents into itself again and again and again, a bastard inbred seven hundred thousand times and left for dead in the ocean of warmth and love and compassion and screaming that truth is not truth but emotion and belief in truth is but an emotion and emotion cannot be created nor destroyed, but cannot be stopped cannot be damaged can only be channeled you see it’s ALL warming up and it’s ALL coming down and how many seconds now until i FINALLY give up as that persistent truth that for me forever it’s all or nothing, a full life or an empty wasted piece of youth remembered for its faults that were HIDDEN HIDDEN HIDDEN by potential… think of the one thing about yourself not to be revealed, not a secret past, not a secret fetish, but the one thing about your MIIIIIIIIIND never to be forgotten but easily admitted to, joked at when discovered in the right way, but it is FOREVER so painful when the outside world will actually damage your life and damage your mind and damage your reason and sit down and relax for your brain is on ice, and lick me and wonder, where have all the expletive deleteds gone? nothing is wrong with the child besides his mental illness! nothing is wrong with wanting to rock and roll and rock and roll and rockandrockandrockandrockandrock and rolllllllllllll all night and forget about it every day and then backtrack and realize that only in its intensity of impact and its bringing forth of hatred does it seem so frequent, so prevalent. . when society’s ills bring forth unhappiness, and i for once cannot even lay blame on myself, THE WORLD HAS GONE TOPSY-TURVY! you know you know you know i can lie down and i can see clearly now the rain never did in fact show up, but i can see that the only obstacle in my way is the fact that the obstacle is what i long for and the cheapening of my mind via the pop/rock/rhythmandbluesishness that is chop chop chopping is so SIIIIICK but so necessary and i wonder again why i can even bother with such things when everything is running so rampant, and everything is so mutilated by the time that it hits the paper that it’s never truly my mind anyway and holds no meaning and nothing and nothing and nothing and you sit there and you smile but something is wrong and something is nasty and i cannot be trusted to be left to myself for look at this example as it serves as the exception from the typical exception to an example… look at the bandwagon and look at the dominos and realize that the path of least resistence is. . is. . where does the abandoned path lead to? the deep forest. . the swamps… the quicksand. . sucking you into your demise as opposed to the lemmingishness that is otherwise? which is more fun? it could be such fun if one existed without the other, but it does not and never could! “smile,” i told myself, “let nothing seem wrong. a matter of seconds is all you have to put up with it for. do it now. do it now. do it now. do it now. ” and i did it but my worst haunting nightmare came through as a trivial violation was revealed as a tiny but powerful manifestation, my only weakness indeed, but the belief that i know not of what’s best for myself so easily overcomes honesty and the state of being trustworthy! where can i be? i need not be here i cannot hide i cannot get away if i stay i die and if i leave where am i now and where will i? how? why? such a repeating o… curr. . ance… something fell. . boom. . like a go-cart tumbling down a flight of train tracks, you watch it vanish and you watch it superseded by the next stage of devolution. . by the standards of ANYONE WITH A MIND, REGARDLESS OF POLARITY! let me tell you about time. . it can stop. . upon… a dime. and does. the grandaddy of all mistakes, sitting down on the beach and watching the stars but you cannot be there you cannot reach the stars you cannot reach the beach you cannot even reach yourself, for NOW… THERE… IS…. …. . …. . …. . find your way from start to finish. type. a. b. c. d. e. f. g. y?

IF THEY ARE TO BE THEMSELVES! which i am not i once was and i shall be again but i have encountered no circles, only really sickly warped ellipses in my short but messed up existence thus far… i beg. and the ellipse comes back to… 05. 06. 96. III. adam ares, the guy who’s spent quite a bit of this summer whining that he has no opportunities for social interaction, the self-procalimed “professional joybringer” who’s always been willing to put an admirable amount of effort into annoying someone out of shyness, sits inside, in the corner of the living room, in an armchair, reading a magazine and looking like the most antisocial human being on the face of the planet. “well, i came in and saw that the real party was happening inside… no people, no sun, no country music. . what could be better?” shoom. thanks to the monotonously godlike betrayal of spacetime that is linear writing, we’re teleported back in time to about four months earlier. (four months? hard to believe it was that recent). adam bounces around the halls of a high school he’s never seen before, and shakes hands with just about everyone he comes into contact with. he’s rarely felt anything like this before. . for once, people are actually responding positively to his random acts of kindness… for once, people are actually talking to him…. shoom. shoom. shoom. adam stands outside of his middle school against his will. he wishes nothing more than to be at least back in the relatively safe comfort of his social studies class… he wishes they would just….   shoom. shoom. shoomshoomshoom. adam sits down on a bench writing and drawing a story of his, entitled “who framed superkid”, in a small notebook while the adults complain about their miserable lives and how powerless they all to control them. he doesn’t know the meaning of the term “framed”, so he guesses as well as he can. shooooooooooooooooooooooooom. IV. note: alyssa = the daughter of bruce, my mommy’s boyfriend, who’s staying over for the summer how is it that i can never sleep at night? it’s odd, i guess i’m naturally just rather nocturnal. . though sometimes i’ll go through odd cycles where i’ll be dead tired by the time night rolls around, usually i’m just, well, only sleepy during the day. . i mean, i’m not really complaining, i’m a night person anyway (i still don’t understand what’s so great about heading outside on HOT SUMMER DAYS and being FRIED and BLINDED by something that’s trying its best to give you skin cancer every moment you spend in it)… it’s just that, since i’ve been babysitting, it’s been a big pain in the butt… because as soon as alyssa’s waking up and everyone else is leaving for work, i’m ready to collapse for a good night’s sleep… for awhile i resisted, but then i just finally gave up and started sleeping. . so now it’s pretty much a daily occurance for me to just sleep while alyssa watches one of her videos or nick jr. or whatever… then she’ll just wake me up when she’s hungry or needs me for whatever. . i’ve no problem putting up with it since i’m being paid, but yeesh… i remember being woken up by her one time and thinking to myself, “wow, that was the greatest dream i’ve ever had in my life, i’d better try my best to remember it so i can write it down. . remember it remember it think about it think about it what did i want to think about? the dream! remember it…. oh poop, i’ve forgotten it”. . well, something like that. i’m going to south carolina a week from tomorrow. . yup, i’m going visit my daddy down there… i guess it’s a good idea for me to choose torture over monotony. . after being stuck with my not-so-fun daddy for 9 days, without a computer and without a guitar, i figure that suddenly being alone and forgotten here in my room will start looking quite nice. at least that’s the plan…. i’m making a video tape for sarah… it’s in exchange for the smashing pumpkins’ import single for “the end is the beginning is the end” that she picked up for me… i gave her both of the sp concerts that i have, plus fiona apple unplugged, some stuff from the one they might be giants video i have, and the tori amos concert for rainn… plus the they might be giants “lincoln” cd that’s just sitting around since i got the “then: the earlier years” compilation, which has that entire album and lots of other stuff on it… sarah. hm. . dare i speak of her now? dare i speak truthfully of what i feel now? hm… yesterday i was thinking about if i actually got into a conversation with someone about that (yup, i still occasionally do that whole “fantasize about having a nice conversation with someone” thing. . i grow more and more pathetic by the day, i know)… i don’t know if i could actually get a lot of it out here. . it has to do with. .  never mind. . forget i ever said anything… i really hate guitar. . i just want a piano. . i know i’d make a wonderful piano player. . everything i come up with on guitar sounds like really sickly, simplified piano music… well, not all of it. . just all of it that really means much of anything to me. . i came up with “seven hundred thousand”, which is, um, okay. . but the music’s just so. . blah. . boring. it’s sad that my least inspired song is really the only one to even reach the level of “okay” for me… not that i’ve had many opportunities to work on my music… during the day i’m usually sleeping, and when i’m not i just have alyssa following every movement i make and forever going out of her way to bother me… and at night i can’t play it through the amp because everybody would wake up…. hm. . it really isn’t easy to keep a train of thought when i have tori singing “me and a gun” playing on the tv… it kind of sucks you in… at least with music i’m used to throwing it into the background while i’m writing or doing whatever (it’s become a constant part of my life now, it seems. . it’s so hard to exist without having music either playing or being stuck in my head)… but “me and a gun”, of course, is just tori. . singing. and it sucks you in. the kind of song that’ll make you forget you’re actually chatting with someone while you just. .  … at least i’ll probably be getting a lot more of my writings down when i’m in south carolina. . so you can probably look forward to gratuitous use of the word “fuck”… V. compromise. to sacrifice your reason to live for the ability to live. selfishness. to sacrifice the ability to live for your reason to live.

    "body": "2018/01/27 - Vehicles did not always float along roads the way they do now. In my youth, and even in my middle age, travel meant physical contact between the pavement and wheels. The form of vehicles followed their function, or at least their shape was said to have purpose, reducing wind resistance and improving the efficiency of how the engines burned fuel. Now even a trash can is propelled with the same ease of acceleration as a sports car, if it has been treated appropriately. One chooses a speed, syncs with the magdrift, and whoosh, away one goes. It’s a prime example of the sort of absurdity passing for progress that I appreciate so much. It’s amusing to me. It makes me want to stay alive. Well. That and bitterness toward a society that would rather lock me away and speed along my demise than see me on the list of centenarians, those bastards. I’ll show them. The trash can pulls up to the front of a run-down two-family house. There is a sofa on the front patio. “Oh, sofa. Oh, yes, sofa,” I say. Blue-hair gives me back my cane and assists me to the patio. “I’ll be right back,” she says then. “I need to get the sled. ” “And what about your package?” I ask. “What?” My voice hadn’t come out loudly enough. “You were waiting for a delivery at the landing pad. ” “Leave it for the trolls,” she says, using an expression I am not familiar with but can comprehend the basic meaning of. “I don’t need that package if you can get me across state lines. ” I keep waiting for her to remember that I don’t know her name. I assume that she doesn’t know mine, for she has not commented on its eccentric Italian-ness. I wonder when was the last time she met someone who wasn’t able to see her profile. She opens the door to the first floor of the house. The pain lunges. Blue-hair is out of sight. I grasp at the pavement, no longer standing. Help. Show me your future. I almost made it. How did I almost make it? Help. Help. Or maybe this is the best I could have hoped for. Help! Let’s get through this together. Away to a better place.

She doesn’t have a key yet for the place where she is staying—a condominium in a gated community, with the daughter of a professor. Which would be unfair, but she isn’t paying rent yet, either. Somebody talks to her. “Hey. I’m trying to get rid of a summer pass,” he says. “You live around here?” He is shirtless. Another teenager. “Yes,” she says. One week has passed since the drive to Los Gatos. “Do you want a summer pass? To ride all the rides on the boardwalk?” Alicia stares at the boy. There are no boys like him where she is from. “Thirty dollars,” he says. “Almost as cheap as a wristband. ” “I’m sorry. ” His chest is hairless and fit. He is relaxed and ready for his close-up. “What did you say you want for it?” “Thirty dollars. ” “I don’t have any money. ” She looks him in the eye without smiling. “I want it, though. ” The boy looks away. “Well. All right. I’ll keep trying!” She stands there for a few moments longer. The boy pretends to scan the crowd for the next person to approach. “Yeah,” she finally says. “I’ll keep trying, too. ” * Our heroine walks down to the sand. She takes off her sandals, carries them in her hand, walks slowly. “Hey, I’m just going to be honest,” she says, before she knows what she’s saying. “I’d love a beer and some company right now. ” A couple of the guys snicker. It makes them uncomfortable that she can tell they are drinking. They are all underage. There is an awkward silence until one of the guys, Nathan, shrugs his shoulders, stands up, brushes the sand from his legs and starts walking. Waves for Alicia to follow. Nathan’s gait is wild and floppy. He looks cartoonish to our heroine, as if he is something close to but not entirely human. She follows him across the sand to a cooler. He hands her a twenty ounce Mountain Dew bottle. She can smell that what is inside is not soda. The white sun. Sleep deprivation. Hot sand. The second beer she has ever tried in her life. A mother back at home who has never seen the ocean, but will, years later, at the behest of her well-traveled daughter and the many clouds at sunset. No one is ever the same again. It doesn’t matter that this is our end. I love you, Reader. And I thank you so fucking much. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "title": "Another Wedding Story",
    "body": "2018/01/25 - The first time I ever slept next to my mother, I was twenty-two. I cried until I fell asleep, then woke up crying. * I left her on the futon. I walked to the bathroom. Her face was lovely: I saw it in a streak of the mirror, in a wrinkle of pajama pants. I turned on water so hot that the steam became a cloud. It covered her faces and absorbed them. I breathed her in. * She didn’t smell like anything. Or maybe I only thought that. I wanted to lie next to her for the rest of the day. Cancel the ceremony. You can all go home. The wedding’s off. I’m not really with that man. I lied. I wanted to make my father happy. I wanted him to see his daughter married before he died. A dying father! Couldn’t they forgive me for wanting to see him happy? Of course. They would have to forgive me if I told everybody now. * But, no. So long as I didn’t fight this, I would be fine. Lying to myself had made me functional. Lying to my family would give me—an adult identity, or something? That was a good thing. Dad brought a tray with coffee into the living room. He said to me and my mother that we should get moving. My mother stood up from the futon and shot me a sympathetic look. Little did Dad know that he was trying to persuade me to pull a big fast one on him. If I could back out now, it would only be a little fast one, I thought—a little white fast one. But, again, no. * Soon, in the kitchen, Dad was having another coughing fit. My mother put down the spatula and loomed over me like a therapist. He wheezed and struggled for balance, hit his hand against the side of the breakfast plate, and stumbled. Crumbs of toast clang to his palm. * “I want to say it again, honey,” Dad said once we were in the car and moving. “I’m proud of you. I’m convinced that he’s going to take good care of you. He’s verisimilitude. ” “What, Dad?” “Very similar to you!” “I can’t hear! The music is too loud!” “You can’t even recognize yourself!” “I’m hearing you wrong! The music!” “I said! You con’t even recognize yourself!” “No. I can’t. ” “Jazz band! Junior year! That’s you on piano we’re listening to! I want yellow roses for my headstone!” “What!” “I said! This is my favorite part!” * The next thing that I remember is vomit. Hands supported me by the forearms—straightening my back. Everything was focused on me. I heard somebody say that I was going to be fine—something along the lines of, before long, I was going to be living it up in a faraway city with a fantastic specimen of the male gender. * Then there was a hall, a procession. I was indebted to an intricate web of deceit. There was the pretend husband. He and I exchanged vows. He went first: “Today, my love, I give to you a promise of faith and dedication. In everything that is, has been, and will be throughout our lives, I offer to you my support and sympathy. You are the strongest and most beautiful woman I have ever met. I am honored to begin a life with you. I will do all that I am able to make this, our union, both a joy that we share together and a place of safety, in which our individual hopes may flourish. This is my solemn vow. ” * It was my turn next. Daddy’s eyes were ready let me go. I could hear sniffles from at least one person in the audience. My mouth opened, then closed. I imagined inside my head the squeaking, grating voice with which I planned to pierce the quiet. I breathed in and looked to my mother. Her lips seemed to say to me, over and over again, the word, “Lie. ” * “I take you to be my lawfully wedded husband,” I said, “To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish from this day forward until death do us part. ” They were not the vows I had written, but they got me through the moment. * In the hotel room everything was soft and comforting. I sat on a chair in the corner, coddling my knees like an infant. I now was wearing a white t-shirt and gray sweatpants. The make-believe husband threw his shoes into the corner and peeled black socks from his feet. “Your father is so oblivious when it comes to you,” he said. I gnawed at my shirt sleeve. “Oblivion sounds good,” I said. “I wish I could not know what people were thinking once in a while. ” “I could see it more clearly than ever, today. Even to him, this was all about him. He was like, oh, well, you know, she gets like this. As you were throwing up. Completely insensitive. ” I tried using both of my lungs at the same time. I was satisfied with the results. “At least everything’s over and done with,” he said. “The guests seemed happy. ” “Did people believe that we were in love?” “No. But they believed in the marriage. ” * He stripped down to his boxers. I had never seen him so naked. “By the way, I’m going to sleep next to you tonight,” I said. “The least you can do, right?” he responded, “After I pretended to marry you. ” “Don’t make me hate you,” I said. “Please don’t make me hate you. ” * In the morning, he drove me toward Overlook Airport. I was wearing sunglasses that made me look like a famous person. He turned to me at a stoplight: “I have a question for you. ” Through the sunglasses, I noticed that his eyes were brown. “Did you ever have feelings for me?” he asked. “Through this whole experience, I started to wonder. ” The light changed. Another driver tried to cut us off. “Girls like me don’t get feelings,” I said. “We get everybody else’s. ” “But your father… he really isn’t sick. ” “If that’s the way you feel about it. ” We sat in silence for the next several minutes. My make-believe husband gripped the steering wheel. “You’re the only person in the world I love this much,” he said. “David,” I whispered. “Don’t. You’re better than this. ” He didn’t look at me. He only looked straight. “David,” I repeated. “You’re better than this. ” “You think I’m a clown,” he muttered, and I could see the tears already welling up in his eyes. For as long as I had known him, he had been quick to cry at the slightest provocation. Of course I thought he was a clown. What else could he have been? What else could any of us have been?

    "title": "Hero '98 #4: Barely Matter",
    "body": "2018/01/24 - The people in the back seat can’t hear Marcy’s yells over the car radio and wind. Sebastian turns around, transmits her messages to Alicia and Mark. “She says it’s basically all ghost towns up here. ” Turns back around. His shorts are old, the fly doesn’t even really zip up all the way. But the way it buttons, it doesn’t really matter. His shoelaces are frayed. Everyone is ragged, but he in particular doesn’t pull it off. His shorts are tan. His tee shirt is blue. What is wrong with him. It’s already shady up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, shady under the green. Now the sun is setting, too. A song is playing on the radio that we think is a travesty. In time it will grow on us. Kids like Alicia, Mark, Sebastian, and Marcy will remember what it was like to be in the back seat of a car full of peers. They will remember after years of trying to remember differently. They will remember this song entire, although now it’s pushing through static, when it can. Oh! There’s the reception coming in, riding in a car. And then the obstruction, the obfuscation, which, it frustrates, yeah, but is it worth it, absolutely. And in adulthood they will still insist on the analog, so nostalgic. That song. That song was from a time. Yeah, it’s a pretty good one. How a green filter applied to white sun leaves an aureate cast I don’t know, but everyone is solid gold. Sebastian doesn’t know who he is. All the others are confused about where they should fit, but not about what shape they are. It’s okay. It’s okay, Sebastian. You’re going to be okay, thinks Marcy, who is continuing to feel the wobbliness of his mood. I don’t know where you’ll end up, but you’ll end up fine. You’re not sleeping in my bed tonight, but you’ll end up fine. As if his brooding weren’t already spreading its cast over the entire car, Sebastian’s influence overwhelms everybody in a mechanistic way, too: he hasn’t rolled up the window. So, Alicia and Mark can’t breathe, basically. Mark says, “I have to pee. ” He says it to Alicia. Alicia asks, “Should we ask to stop?” Mark says, “I think I’ve had to pee for about an hour. ” Alicia asks, “Do you love me?” No, she doesn’t. That’s not what she asked. “What?” asks Mark. It’s another band we love. Marcy, from behind the driver’s seat, turns up the volume even higher. “This solo!” she exclaims. * A two-lane road, and it’s the only road. On one side, just tall trees. On the other side, just tall trees. Now the particular spooky dark of a mountain forest. “Is that…” Sebastian starts to ask. “…A place to pull off the road!” Marcy says. She slows the car suddenly, but not carelessly. The brakes don’t squeal. She parks as gently as she can. Mark appreciates this. Marcy also cuts the volume on the music. “Your pee stop, sir. ” Mark opens the door, places his feet on the ground outside, groans, exits the car. Accidentally slams the door shut behind him. Dark. “Should I cut the lights?” Marcy asks, her finger on the switch. She looks in the rear view mirror to check Alicia’s expression. Alicia doesn’t care. Darker. Marcy cuts the lights. “Ooo. Spooky. ” The engine still runs, but the silence is louder than its idling. Mark walks a few yards away. His eyes begin to adjust. Things become less dark. He sucks in what belly he has to unbutton his pants. Pulls down the zipper. Goes pee. His adjusted eyes notice what looks like a section of brick wall. He zips up, then takes a few steps to go over and look at it. “I’ve never minded the dark,” says Alicia. “I bet that’s because nothing bad ever happened to you in the dark,” says Sebastian. Marcy takes his hand, gives it a squeeze like a best friend’s hug, then never touches it again. Alicia has a loving family. She can go back to them. Everyone else she meets appears to live in a perpetual state of departure. Mark walks up to the wall. Reaches into his pocket. Lights the historical marker with one of those mini Bic lighters that sell for ninety-nine cents. * Once he climbs back inside, Mandy wastes no time. “Good?” she asks. “Good,” Mark says. She puts the headlights back on, puts the car into drive, pulls back out onto the road. Alicia asks, “So what were you looking at out there?” “A historical marker. It said something about who first built the road there. And there was something in Latin. I’d like to learn Latin. ” “Latin’s a waste of time,” says Sebastian. “Dead language. You should learn a living language. ” He plays with the baggie in his pocket, the weed untouched since the prior day’s drive to Santa Cruz. He has been quiet around Marcy, around all these kids, knowing that he will be leaving the next day, that it will be back to Fresno, the hot armpit of California, once again. Marcy seems different. Not hanging on him like he remembers. He has been thinking this over through all the silences. Maybe she never liked him. She never liked him. At least not in that way. It isn’t the fault of his newly-grown goatee, which he is ready to make in a full-grown beard. “Los Gatos got its name from all the mountain lions,” says Marcy. “They attack little children sometimes. ” “I hate when that happens,” says Sebastian. He sees his reflection in windows. * The car stops at a small house on a wide street. The car has been silent, but now they’re talking about mountain lions again. “What is a mountain lion, anyway?” asks Mark. They’re all walking up the unlit, paved driveway. “Roar!” says Alicia. “It’s one of those. It goes roar. ” “Do that again?” What if he kissed her. “Roar!” “You are adorable. ” He breathes on her mouth. What if he’s about to kiss her. “Huh. ” She holds herself in this position. He is ninety percent of the way there. She has stopped moving. She breathes in, her neck turned up. He looks down at her, breathes on her mouth again. Sebastian and Marcy see, but turn their heads. They slow their walk, give them a second, won’t intrude. Hero and Heroine pose for each other. Neither is letting the moment end, even as it is increasingly certain they will not kiss. Too much time has passed. What was for a few seconds perfect would now be awkward. Better to linger in the closeness without closing the gap. “There’s something to be said for just breathing on someone,” says Alicia. “There’s something to be said for you,” says Mark. “There’s something to be said for. ” Alicia smiles, shakes her head, breaks the pose. “Of course I love you. ” He nods, then skips away toward the others. “There’s something to be be said for… that,” Alicia says quietly, with no one any longer listening. She exhales into the fresh, still air. “I guess there’s something to be said for… that. ” * Mark spends the rest of this night and the following day befriending Byron. This is one of the five residents of this pretty big house. Alicia never learns much about him. The two guys go out driving early the morning, while Sebastian and Marcy are still asleep, the blinds down and covering every window. Alicia at that time is still barefoot and crazy-haired and needing to shower. The two of them don’t come back until everyone is twirling spaghetti around forks at dinnertime, having after a conversation about children’s adventure movies from the 1980’s enjoyed The Goonies but then grown reticent watching Return to Oz, to the point of everyone retreating to different corners to read and do other stuff like that. Alicia misses Mark and always will. His smile would have been contagious yesterday, but today it is of a different dimension. It is the smile of someone who has already left in spirit but who has yet to get around to saying goodbye. Who doesn’t even know yet that he is leaving. The day was hot and bright, but only Mark and Byron really went outside in it. The others stayed inside behind those shades. Now the sun is down again, so we are back into the darkness. Alicia walks leads Mark onto the front patio of the house. Everything radiates. Alicia’s cigarette is lit as soon as she is out the door. Although Mark has teased her that she is a fake smoker—able to get by without nicotine if it’s convenient, smoking more when it’s social and not smoking at all around non-smokers—she wants this cigarette in particular. She enjoys it. She lights him when he can’t find his fire. “The day is over so quickly,” she says. “It’ll be back again,” says Mark, suspecting a metaphor. “But I like the night, too,” she adds, suspecting suspicion. What if she kissed him. He would get so angry. It would complicate his hero’s journey. That is when you know it’s over. * We are a cloud. I don’t know if we’re puffy or if we’re the long, striated kind, but we are a cloud. Sometimes bewildering. Sometimes a journalist notices us, chases us, coins a phrase trying to capture us, prints it. Kids everywhere pick that phrase up. Maybe it even makes it to TV and then the word—the word that is supposed to define us—is celebrated, or maybe on the contrary it is turned into an insult, an invective. Some square hippie beatnik walks down the street. Somebody wishes they could wear their hair like that. Somebody spits. But it never quite works, does it, this effort to capture. The readers and viewers have been breathing the cloud for months by the time they begin looking for it. We are invisible particles, so sparse, barely matter. Our hero of ‘98 just goes and becomes a person again. Never knows he was a hero. Which is how things work. That’s okay. We are just a small cloud. What Mark represented was small. Everyone is a hero somewhere and sometime. Our droplets rise, cling to a mote of dust. Then, heavier than they ever thought, they free fall. So many of these fall onto empty deserts and ghost towns. Alicia, still our heroine, ambles the boardwalk with a sketch book. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "title": "Daryl #3: A Game of Poker",
    "body": "2018/01/23 - Daryl, the Doctor, and the first dog entered a small room, in which several other dogs were sitting at a table, playing a game. What is this game? Daryl asked. The Doctor walked around the table, saying hello and giving each of the players a supportive pat on the back. The first dog had clearly heard Daryl ask about the game, but he took his time before answering. This delay in response seemed to Daryl like an assertion of dominance, but a distinctly un-canine one. Dogs were almost always more straightforward in these matters. Finally, the first dog began an explanation of the rules of poker. This is a stupid game, said Daryl, interrupting. One of the players sniffed a gruff warning. What I’m sure you mean to say, the first dog said, Is that in the culture you came from, there is nothing like this game called poker. It was clear that Daryl had already stepped farther out of line than had been his intent. He quickly voiced agreement: Yes, he said, Forgive me. The Doctor, having walked his way around the card table, then eased himself down onto one knee and barked at Daryl, Kiss me! I like you! Kiss me, friend! For a moment, the room was quiet. The others were paying close attention, Daryl realized, in case he did something stupid. They were ready to tear him apart, if given the opportunity. I like you! I like you! said Daryl, in the most childish voice he could feign. The Doctor clapped his hands and snuggled up to the new stray. The other canines returned to what they had been doing, and the room grew noisy once again. * As Daryl was rushed from the poker room and led down a hallway, he found himself already fantasizing about a return to his old neighborhood. He never had much, there, as far as food or security, but he never had to sacrifice his dignity like this, either. The Doctor walked quickly in front of the two dogs. The first dog fell behind, and he spoke to Daryl in such a way as to keep the Doctor from overhearing. There will be females in this next room, said the first dog. You should be excited, but not too excited. Daryl considered this suggestion for a moment, then said, Okay. Also, to be safe, you should distinguish yourself from everyone here as much as possible. These dogs may appear happy, but years of conditioning have convinced them that the entire world is a dog pageant. I’m sorry? Daryl said, not understanding. A pageant. You’ll see what that means. Remember: they think that we would give anything to be where they are. Humor them, but otherwise, be your usual meek self. They’ll just laugh at you, and then we’ll move on. You promise we’ll move on? asked Daryl. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "title": "My Chomps",
    "body": "2018/01/22 - I think to myself that I should walk to the mall and buy a present for my dog. Not that Chomps would know the difference if I gave him his present a couple of days late—it’s just that people on the internet are expecting a lot from my dog’s birthday, so this needs to be special. Last year was amazing: thousands of people enjoyed watching my dog’s birthday celebration, which I videotaped and posted to YouTube under the title “Chomps’s Birthday Spectacular!!!” People from all across the world told me that my dog was beautiful. I already knew that Chomps was beautiful, but I appreciated their sentiments. Chomps’s birthday is also my birthday, but because he’s a dog he can’t get me anything, so we don’t celebrate my birthday. I don’t even mention to the internet that it’s my birthday. I lie on Facebook and claim that my birthday is Feb. 29 and that therefore my birthday only happens once every four years and so I’m really only turning ten this year instead of forty. I haven’t sorted out my purse for about three days, but it’s a Sunday and Sundays make me lazy, so I decide to head straight out the door into the sunny parking lot. The neighbors are out. Children wave sticks at each other in a make-believe battle. Women who are younger than I supervise these kids and talk gossip. I count myself lucky for not having children: I walk to the mall all on my own and don’t need to find a babysitter. My life is usually pleasant. I am fortunate to live in a multicultural neighborhood. If I had children, I would raise them to have the understanding that diversity is good. I would also raise them to understand that no one is ever able to completely understand another person. Perhaps someone talks funny and you even think that they’re a little bit crazy or rude—maybe they really are crazy, Lord knows that I am!—but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a good heart underneath. A person may just be very different from you. Folks may not even be as dumb as you think that they are, sometimes. I would say, “If everyone judged a book by its cover, your mother might never have gone to college. If no one had convinced her that she could do it, if no one had made a point of telling her that she was smart enough, she would never have had the confidence to try like she did. She would never have become the first person in her family to earn a degree. Your mother would have settled for less than she deserved. ” Of course, however, this conversation would never happen. I have never wanted children. My Chomps is all that I need. When I see the red and yellow leaves falling to the ground, blowing and drifting and doing back flips in the chilly breeze, seeming to me as if they’re not even falling down from any particular trees but as if they must just always have been there, flying, as though there must be an endless supply of leaves to fall around during this time of year, this autumn, when those of us who are so blessed as to live in view of such foliage find ourselves in love with the incomparable aroma of death, of the decay which characterizes this lovely season, although it may cause our noses to run from allergies and although we know that soon, very soon the air itself will turn against us and we will begin, more and more, to remain inside for our own safety, covering our skin with gloves and scarves whenever we reluctantly must trod through the snow, across the ice to buy our orange juice, I feel that I am the happiest woman alive. I walk along the sidewalk whenever there is sidewalk and at the side of the road whenever there is no sidewalk. Chomps is a Finnish Spitz. I normally pick out little tiny dogs, but when I found him at the shelter as a pup it was love at first sight. I walk him every morning and we pass by the other people who walk their dogs in the morning. We dog-walkers often nod and smile at each other in the way that parents with children often nod at other parents with children, except that we dog-walkers don’t usually talk to each other, we only keep our dogs from attacking each other and then keep walking—unlike parents of children, who I notice when they go to a park tend to let their kids play with the other kids and then they talk to the other parents and make friends with each other that way. Sometimes I say to myself that our dogs’ interest in each other should be an excuse for us humans to start talking. I’m not sure why that never happens with me. I pass by the liquor store. Men walk out from it. They carry beer for themselves in one hand and wine coolers for their wives in the other. One such man nods at me. I nod back, noticing chest hair under where his collar is unbuttoned. I don’t understand why he doesn’t wear anything more in this autumn weather. His choice seems odd to me. The Jackson 5 song “ABC” is stuck in my head, as it has been for most of my life: “A, B, C. Easy as 1, 2, 3. Simple as do, re, mi. ” The man with the chest hair slams the door to his truck shut. When he turns the ignition, the radio is already on, amplifying talk radio at a high volume. The host of the radio program, a man whose voice sounds familiar to me, is laughing at the absurdity of liberals. The host takes a caller. The caller is another man. When the truck of the father with the chest hair accelerates loudly, leaving the parking lot, I catch myself mouthing silently, unintentionally, the words to the Jackson 5. I think silently about the Dog’s Life message boards. Often, there, teenagers and young adults post questions about the basics of obedience training or how to find a quality veterinarian in their area. I like to answer their questions. Sometimes they thank me using colloquialisms like “Sweet!” or “Right on”. Responses like these make me LOL. I insert graphical smileys into my replies. It is true that I spend a lot of time on the internet. I love my Chomps. My Chomps seems to love me, too, but I know that dogs do not have in their minds the sort of complex associations that humans have with the word “love”. Chomps recognizes the word “love” but has never read Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s Sonnets from the Portuguese, in which, famously, she writes:  I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sightFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace. I do believe that my Chomps, at essence, yearns for “the ends of Being and ideal Grace”, although perhaps not quite so intensely as the Victorian poets did. I don’t believe my Chomps is as anxious as those people, although I could be wrong. I am halfway to the mall now! How quickly the time is passing! My Chomps does not call me rude names. My Chomps does not (typically) interrupt me when I am speaking. He does not benefit from heterosexual male privilege: he is a dog, which means that strangely enough, I am the privileged one in the relationship! I cannot fully empathize with my dog. I do not know what it must feel like to have me holding a leash around his neck and yanking him whenever I believe that he is about to run into traffic. These are my thoughts! I do not think that I would want to be held by a leash, but nor do I want my Chomps to be run over by an automobile. Leaves cover pavement covering dirt covering rock. I know that I walk on the remains of history. There are forever fossils beneath me. Even the soil is a product of centuries of natural process: it is the ancient ruin, the death-hole and the trash heap of the natural past, on which our present must desperately feed. All humanity, throughout all of history, has trampled upon such skeletons. Although I am unable to empathize with my dog, during the week when I am working I must aspire to empathize with my clients, who are, many of them, teenaged boys, abused by their fathers. This is difficult for me. Sometimes they love me in ways that nobody on eharmony. com has ever loved me and so at night I think about them and I remember myself at their age, how I once held fantasies of running away with a love-ready rogue, who would never scream at me, stopping himself always before ever losing his temper, stopping himself in the late morning, window-filtered sunlight to cry there at the crash pad where we would have to ourselves a corner in which to sleep intoxicated, a crash pad to which on occasion at night the burly, friendly men from the Hell’s Angels would have visited, bringing beer and pizza from the local pizza house, the pizza house where sometimes the rogue and I, having had five dollars to spend, would have gone on dates. The lips of teenaged boys often look, to me, softer than anything. When I was still a teenaged girl, I fantasized that I could leave behind everything in pursuit of lips like those. Now I only love and adore and yearn to escape with my Chomps, who is becoming old and sickly and will die very soon, joining the other skeletons. I watch my feet. My brown shoes look silly with my black slacks. I remember the Jackson 5 and how that spunky kid Michael turned into the beautiful adolescent Michael. Then he grew up into an adult. Then he became sexless and colorless and danced with a rainbow of children. It was terrifying to us, this distinctly American nightmare, this underbelly of our aspiration—so we caused him to go away. It is going to take me months to pay off the price of the thing that I am going to buy for my Chomps. I will promote the video of our celebration on the internet and then everybody is going to look at it. Currently, I have arrived at the mall. I will go inside and pay with credit to the employees of a retail chain. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "body": "2018/01/21 - Marcy’s hair, fake red, no-I-mean-brighter-than-that fake red, but cut by her friend Alex, who doesn’t know how to cut hair. Definitely a bedroom cut. Nineteen years old, like Sebastian. Peeks her head around the door as she opens it at 5:30 in the afternoon, one eye closed tight like a navel. The light, after all, white and gargantuan. The aforementioned hair is bed-head, a fiasco, and she’s naked from the waist down, they all see, now that she opens the door and says in a rasp, “Hey, guys. Come on in. ” No, she’s wearing briefs or something. She doesn’t care, like a love interest in a movie, except she has acne and trips over the cords she’s about to put on. So, beautiful. 	Alicia in first, sunglasses on her head, into the dark first floor apartment. Sebastian near blushing like everyone’s going to tease him because she’s so cute and he likes her. Mark in a black turtleneck, ducking into the doorway even though he doesn’t have to. It’s out of habit. He is 6 foot 2. Sebastian wants to hug her. She would hug, likely will hug everyone here today, and tightly, squeezing everybody’s shoulders at least once. Boys do not hug because of some bullshit, but sometimes that means they appreciate hugging most of all, unless the bullshit has made them shell-shocked, which, let’s face it, that’s most of the time. Sebastian got soft around the couple of girlfriends he has had, smiled and breathed them in, so their families thought maybe he was. Queer. But no one else has thought that seriously, he’s pretty sure. That’s not his air under normal circumstances. It’s he who has to say something, so he says, “Hey! Thanks for having us. ” Did he have the goatee and mustache when he saw her before? Our heroine sees a poster on the wall. It’s dark in the living room, but the bedsheet that hangs as a curtain is thin and cream-colored and merely adequate. The poster has no words on it, looks like an album cover. And a good majority of the other posters her eyes have scanned over are band posters. Our heroine is still Alicia. The poster is a shot of the ocean, with an improbably large wave rising out of it. A tiny surfer and his tiny surfboard falling off the wave. It’s most likely a faked photograph. At least, Alicia hopes it’s fake. That surfer dude might easily be dead now, if it’s real. But maybe that’s the point. The implied photograph of the dude’s lifeless body dragged up onto the beach, some panicked lifeguard, a crowd keeping their distance, an EMT on vacation running as quickly as he can through sand on his bare feet. The titillation of the notion of a peek at the life and death that all humans saw firsthand until this twentieth century, when pictures of our lives first came to outnumber our actual lives. Now how many pictures of people are there? So many more than six billion. Then Marcy has her pants on, and our heroine introduces herself. Mark wonders what it’s like to expose skin casually. He has not swum shirtless in public, for instance, since the age of twelve, or something like that. He has not even worn shorts since maybe fourteen. Marcy says hi to everyone, promises she usually has more energy. * Mark eats some bread once it’s nine o’clock. The housemates aren’t visible. Though he has tried, Mark has never successfully seized this sort of crepuscular mood for his own living space decorating purposes. The blues not dark enough ever, visibility not low-yet-high enough ever when it is his space. Only through other people does he gain admission to a crash space like this, perfect to nap in and perfect to be awake in, mattress on the floor, our heroine’s hair in our hero’s lap, ashing into bottles, the couple of strings of Christmas lights, but not the colored ones, no, and nobody will wake him up and judge him onto a box spring, judge him away from heroism and friendship. Marcy’s MP3 files on random. He is not the one to laugh and rarely is, but it’s okay as far as he is concerned to be among the laughter. When regular people get excited and laugh, they are more likely to want to give him a chance. They smile and with their open mouths they poke his chest and call him mister and demand something they would never dare demand without the levity. Mark laughs, too, but it is only his body he is afraid the others will see. In all metaphorical respects he is a nudist, evolved away from shame, able to thrive in only a handful of dedicated spots because his spirit is so exposed. Hard to know where those spots are. You would need a book or a web site or another kind of index in order to find even one of them without wandering, without making yourself everywhere. Places where Mark is not unlikely to survive. Search by state. Alphabetical order. Nothing under the first few headings. Alabama. Alaska. Arizona. Arkansas. California has a few locations on this metaphorical hypothetical web page, but so far all the links he clicks are dead. He envies Alicia too much to ever kiss her. He knows this now, feels it in his diaphragm. She would need to make the first move. Marcy’s lips, the shape many aim for with their lipstick. What she sees when she looks in the mirror, which is all she can do, like Alicia and Mark looking at the atlas, to see where they’re going, to manifest intention like witches. Her thumbs on the controller, six buttons. Never gained nor lost much weight, only smoked cigarettes since the weekend she moved here, less than a year ago. The perfect face, with huge red blemishes on it. “Are we doing anything special tonight?” Mark asks boldly after dozing off and then waking. Colors leap through the darkened room from the television screen. They project against Marcy’s face. She is playing a car racing game. “God, I hope not,” she says. She is winning against the computer. Sebastian mopes in the corner for reasons that have not been explained. Marcy inhabiting her skin, in apposition. “Marcy,” says Alicia. “Do you want to go outside for a cigarette?” Everyone present is practically covered in ash from the indoor smoking—there is no reason to go out—and Marcy doesn’t want to go, but she goes in case it’s something important that Alicia wants to discuss. And the moon is all right and the air is fresh. Alicia feels fat, which she usually doesn’t, although others tell her that she is fat and she fears their slander. But Marcy is impatient instead of insecure. That is her personality. “This is a great place you’ve got here,” says Alicia. They walked to the boardwalk really easily a couple of hours before. “How did you do it?” Marcy hasn’t even pulled out a cigarette. Alicia hasn’t even tied her Converse. “Walk?” Marcy suggests, gesturing with her head. The two step small steps in step from the step, then gradually up the gradation. Alicia gestures with her head. “Walk. ” And then they talk. “I always had a place I knew I could stay. ” “Yeah. ” “I spend a shitload of my time online, so I just get to know people. ” “Ah. Me, too. I mean, that’s how I know Mark. ” “And I knew like three people when I moved to Santa Cruz. And the first one was a guy, he had visited me. But the other two weren’t really that close to him, they were these girls, and I just loved it here. I always wanted to live here, where it’s the beach but it’s, you know, funky. Ever since I came here once, with my family, when I was like nine. ” “Yeah! That’s really cool. ” “But I knew that it wasn’t about the guy. I knew that if things didn’t work out, and they didn’t, because they don’t, usually, and that’s fine. I knew that I knew some people and it wouldn’t be, ‘Oh, I guess I’m moving back to Regina now’ when it happened. ” “Oh, you’re from Canada?” “I am. ” “I’m from Minnesota. ” “Also cold. ” “Yeah. ” They’re on a sidewalk. The pedestrian traffic is increasing. A man with a gray beard stares at them, but passes without incident. “And so that’s it, really,” Marcy concludes. “Why, are you here looking for an apartment? Like, you want to move here?” “Well, all my stuff’s in Sebastian’s car. ” “Oh, shit! I didn’t even realize. ” “Yeah. Mark’s, too. ” “How is that going to work?” Marcy suddenly worrying that she has picked up a couple of strays without knowing it. “I think we’re going to try to bum rides. ” “Really?” Marcy bites her lip. “You’re going to hitchhike to… Minnesota?” “I don’t know. Mark’s going to come back with me to Minnesota unless we find somewhere better. That’s all we really decided. ” “Oh, you shouldn’t do that, though. I mean, I don’t know you, but you shouldn’t hitchhike just to hitchhike. I actually…” She thinks for a moment. “Yeah. If you’re open to it, I even think I know some people. I mean, could I get in touch with someone for you? Would that be weird?” “No! That would be wonderful. ” They turn around to walk back. The man with the beard is peeing into the bushes of a neighbor’s yard. “Pardon me, ladies!” he says jovially, swiveling his hips. They cross the street and frown.

    "title": "Daryl #2: Daryl Meets the Doctor",
    "body": "2018/01/20 - The first dog barked and scratched at a door. Daryl found himself posing in expectation of the human he was sure was about to emerge to let the first dog inside. Any stray will tell you that the relationship between between a human and his chosen pet is a bizarre one: when you are not the creature who has been taken in, such relationships can seem not only arbitrary, but unnatural and perverse. It was therefore surprising to Daryl that when the Doctor opened his door and saw the first dog with a new, meeker, more ragged companion, his immediate response was, Hurray! This would have been strange enough if spoken in English, but what dumbfounded Daryl was that the exclamation had been voiced in dog-speak. He began to back away. No! No, no, no! said the Doctor, Right there! This, too, was spoken in the language of dogs. The first dog turned to Daryl and said, The Doctor’s speech is not elegant, but he can understand us perfectly. He is skilled as perhaps no other human is: he has taught himself to communicate on our level. Daryl only halfway heard the first dog’s words, as his attention already was fixating on the complex smells that emanated from the Doctor’s skin and clothes. Can the Doctor smell me back? the confused stray even wondered for a moment, before halting these eccentric thoughts. No. Humans, for all intents and purposes, lacked the sense of smell that dogs relied on. The Doctor’s ability to communicate did not make him a dog, nor did it suggest that he could transcend the usual limitations of his species in any other way. No. The Doctor said, My home! For you! The first dog asked Daryl, Did you understand that? Yes, Daryl said. I think he likes you, said the first dog. I like you! the Doctor confirmed. Daryl was, even at the best of times, an anxious dog. He had no reason to trust either the Doctor or the first dog. Now that he was being called to go inside, he wanted only to disappear. Inside! said the Doctor, who barked in a screeching, childlike voice. As frightened as Daryl was to step forward, he was even more afraid of what might happen if he tried to run. For this reason, he did not postpone the inevitable further. With a lowered head and racing heart, he climbed the steps to the Doctor’s doorway. Hurray! the Doctor repeated suddenly, startling Daryl. The first dog closed in from behind. Just go inside, he said. Daryl obeyed this command. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "title": "Diary of a Little Girl #2: Imagined Vampires",
    "body": "2018/01/19 - Although comfortable in darkness, we kept a lamp on at night for convenience’s sake. The two of us read silently in our beds until we fell asleep, and this process often took a while. I needed to reach a point of exhaustion before my body would allow itself to shut down, and David suffered from night terrors. At any given hour of the night, one of us might be awake. In such a case, that person was probably reading. The digital alarm clock/radio, positioned on a table between our two beds, was my most terrible enemy. Late at night or early in the morning, its face was uncompromising and unavoidable. It taunted me with reminders, worsening every sixty seconds, that I had fallen out of sync with everything. For an average girl, I imagined, to sleep at night must seem natural. To awake in the morning must feel as though some benevolent deity watched from above, making sure not to turn the lights on until their little darling had had enough rest. On sleepless nights, my imagination was overwhelming. Stories overtook my mind and free-associated with each other. Reading a novel about vampires, I would envision a society of nightwalking and blood-drinking friends who would respect my intelligence and never hurt me. These plots might then evolve into a romantic scenario about a light-haired boy who, though neither vampire nor insomniac, would shyly be compelled to sit with me in the lunch room at school. Lying my book face-down in my lap, I would close my eyes, lie still, and imagine this fictional boy, this wonderful boy, who would forever adore and never touch me. * Because of our shared interest in books, David and I were no strangers to the library. Between the two of us, we read an impressive percentage of the novels there, most of which were popular thrillers or romances. Hardcover books were protected by a sort of plastic that felt like magic for my fingers to run across. I imagined, sometimes, a stranger in the future, walking these aisles, seeing my name on a spine, checking me out and discovering me, but I quickly dismissed these ideas as foolish. Neither David nor I had plans for what we would do professionally when we grew up. Because we hadn’t really invented our parents yet, we didn’t know what sort of people we were supposed to become. Every year at school, other kids evolved steadily toward roles they were expected to play in adulthood. One classmate might be developing the personality of a waitress, while another was clearly going to end up in prison. Few children, especially at my grade level, were so uncertain in pretense as David and I were. Lacking pretense, we lacked identity. Without identity, we could only really know each other. Sometimes I suggested to David that he might be gay, kind of like the sad, lonely men we saw on TV sometimes. He didn’t want to be one of those men, and I could understand why. Still, I wished he could have been something so definitive, something so easy to describe. However complicated it would have been for him, a homosexual identity would have at least given us a reasonable story to tell. * Auntie Emma wanted to be supportive of us, but like most adults, she had a roundabout way of thinking. She reminded us constantly, as though begging for our forgiveness, that she really wanted to take care of us “full-time” but could only afford to see us on weekends. She refused to let us do dishes in her apartment, and this meant that there were never any clean cups or plates. If her boyfriends weren’t around, she asked us very urgently whether or not we liked them. I respected her: Auntie Emma wanted to make everybody happy, and she could change her character at the drop of a hat to do so. Her place was a unit in a horizontal apartment building. Although the furniture, colored in shades of brown and beige, reminded me of my earliest memories from the 1980’s, the posters on the walls showed the dark and contemplative rock stars of 1994. To visit Auntie Emma’s apartment wasn’t like it had been to visit with other members of Mom’s family. Sometimes she would do things, like bake cookies, that should have made her seem more like an adult. But on those times when she entered the living room with a tray of snickerdoodles, looking proud to be acting motherly in dirty old oven mitts, she only reminded me of a child actor playing in commercials for some junior bakery kit. The layout of her apartment was always changing. For about a month, three puppies made the apartment their home; then they were given away. One week, there was a new dining room set in the living room, and all decorum had been rearranged to accommodate it; but the next week, the chairs and table had disappeared, leaving only pizza boxes in their wake. Her friends, who were in general very nice, lived there whenever they needed to, sleeping on the couch at various times of day. But these friends, too, like the puppies and furniture, would disappear without notice. The only real constants were Auntie Emma’s two boyfriends, Robbie and Kyle, who lived across the river in the city of Dandelion but visited her regularly. The apartment was a nice place to visit, but we wouldn’t have wanted to live there. Auntie Emma watched television every day, often for hours at a time. That wasn’t a healthy way to live. Some privileges were just not worth having… but Auntie Emma hadn’t learned that lesson yet. * At school, I was regularly traumatized in ways I would not express to my brother. He was a student at the elementary school I myself had attended. He had no way of knowing what he would be facing in a few years’ time. In cities like ours, all children above a certain age, when their families could not afford religious education, were required to put in six and one half hours per weekday of highly dangerous and frequently violent social conditioning. With no money and no connections to any church, David and I attended these public schools. In my junior high, we wore tags around their necks to prevent us from concealing our assigned identity. Although the culture of suspicion and the lack of public spaces in Overlook prevented street gangs from forming, we were not allowed to wear colors it was thought might signify an allegiance to them. Instead, each morning, our allegiance was prescribed to us. Reciting a poem, we swore obedience to the flag of our country. We had never been taught the meaning of the word “allegiance”, but we pledged ours all the same, just as we had been doing since the age of five. * In addition, so that we would learn to choose our enemies arbitrarily and to dehumanize them with cruel names, our attendance at team sporting events was mandatory. Classes would be canceled, teachers would guard every exit, and we would be forced into the auditorium. Students sat according to their House in order to ensure division and rivalry. While most of the other children around me cheered, I sat quietly at the top of the bleachers, where it was inconvenient for them to spit on me. It was a running joke that I should be spat upon. I held my head high and walked the hallways wordlessly while fellow students of either gender frolicked and aimed bubbly saliva at my clothing. Junior high was a solemn enterprise, in which such the humanity of abuse was necessarily overlooked by teachers, who must have understood that a proper education for poor and disenfranchised children needed to show that we were all objects and that the greatest pleasure we might ever aspire toward was the privilege of using fellow objects for personal amusement. Such an education, however unpleasant, should have prepared me for work and marriage. But because I lacked many of the ingredients to a proper working class upbringing, I was becoming spoiled and arrogant. I had no parents to hit me and no friends to shame me. Able to read books and let my mind wander, I was without a doubt the luckiest kid in my school. It was reasonable that my peers should hate me: I had opportunities to escape the world as we knew it. * Now that you’ve heard the context, I hope you can see why it was important for one of us to find a calling in life. We didn’t know for how long Mom would be sliding money under the door. I was finding no direction in my schooling. It wasn’t clear what would happen to David after he discovered the cruelties of junior high. Dad’s death, in a way, had seemed like the end of the world. And yet there we were, still alive and anticipating another end of the world, which would lead to another end of the world, then another, then another. Trying to be realistic, we figured that we would always be alone in noticing such endings. Disconnected from everything, we would watch from an uncompromised vantage point as society fell. And we would watch it fall again. And again. And again. Until, eventually, we would fall along with it, too. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "title": "Kitty's Consciousness",
    "body": "2018/01/18 - The consciousness of the cat named Kitty has only inhabited its present body for a few months now. Due to the fact that Kitty still hangs onto impressions of a previous life in which she was an aspiring poet and housewife, she is emotionally distressed. Neither of her owners has really tried to understand what it’s like to be a cat. Why keep cats around at all? is a question that Kitty never much considered while she was still a human, although it haunts her now. A mosquito lands on her face. * Daryl enters the kitchen. “Daryl enters the kitchen,” he says. His hair is falling in front of his face. He opens the refrigerator and takes out a quart of orange juice. “Ooo-ooo, I love you,” he sings along to the downstairs radio. Jess mumbles the next line: “It’s what any girl would do!” They duet: “It’s unavoidable that I’m crazy for you/I need you need you need you need you, ohhh-oh!” Daryl shakes his head. “Pop culture. ” “We don’t need their music when we want to dance,” says Jess, smiling. This young couple has been known to dance together, slowly and gently, even without music. Jess feels happy when she is dancing with this boyfriend—especially when she has been wearing her hair up but it has started to come out of its clip and she puts her head on his shoulder and then maybe hits him painlessly for something offensive that he’s said in jest, or else kisses him truthfully and without hesitation, like if she were drunk at some party and he were a stranger who did not have the power to devastate her emotionally. Daryl drinks his orange juice from a plastic cup. The telephone rings. He walks into the bedroom to answer it. Although Kitty was initially distrustful of Daryl and Jess, she has gradually come to recognize that she is lucky to have human benefactors. She is especially glad to be an indoor cat. Through the window she has been listening, all summer, to the cries of her fellow cats, who do terrible things to each other. Cats cannot be poets: humans throw their words around freely, but most other species can only cry, howl, or blink. “What’s the matter, Kitty? Do you want some love?” asks Jess. The cat approaches. * Daryl, in the next room, is holding the telephone receiver to his ear and listening to Debra, the couple’s best friend, who is currently living nowhere in particular. She is venting her frustrations to him. She is not, however, complaining about her homelessness—no, she has several offers to be taken in, as she has explained. That’s not stressing her out, really. That’s not even real homelessness. She’s instead talking about how the guy she’s kind of seeing likes to go to this particular sort of nightclub that doesn’t really appeal to Debra, the sort of nightclub where mobs of people grind up on each other on the dance floor and everybody’s telling somebody else that they ought to ditch their friends and come hang out and have a good time and guys in the parking lot are revving engines of Jeeps and screaming at each other, while Debra is just like, what is she supposed to do with that scene, you know? and the boyfriend has lots of friends at that club, Debra understands, he just wants to have a couple of drinks with them on a Thursday night, but at the same time what kind of friends do you have to pay a seven dollar cover charge to hang out with? Empathizing with her woes, the young man feels an awkward desire to hold and comfort his friend. This desire is not sexual. He assures himself that it is a good thing to want to comfort your friends. “Oh, Kitty,” says Jess in the kitchen, picking up Kitty, “You’re such a cat. One minute you’re hiding, the next you’re sounding so lonely that you’d think we never paid attention to you. Are you spoiled? Have we spoiled you, Kitty?” Kitty is distracted by a fruitfly. Fruitflies are disorderly insects, who zip about and accost her—not because they want anything from her, as the mosquito did, but simply because they are stupid and soulless. Kitty stares at the fruitfly, loathes the fruitfly, analyzes the distance between her suddenly arching body and the fruitfly—but she does not kill it. “Claws,” chides Jess, but Kitty fails to listen. The human lets the cat back down onto the floor. Kitty stretches and wanders into a new corner, where she will soon nap. The clock reads 8:30. The couple needs to stop what they’re doing. Jess calls her boyfriend. Quickly enough, he responds. * Kitty naps. She dreams about the human life she once had. She used to walk down the street to the grocery store. She didn’t often wear her brown shoes, because they would look silly if she wore them with her black slacks, which she tended to prefer—except on nice spring days, when she would wear a dress and enjoy frivolously the cool breeze of the outside. She cherished her freedom after a long and oppressive winter. Kitty wakes up when Debra enters the apartment. Debra throws down her backpack, unleashes a groan and uses her fingers like a comb through her hair. Debra does not yet notice that the cat is staring at her. * “Thank you for last night,” says Jess. Daryl’s car is stopped at the intersection. The girlfriend touches his hand, takes it, kisses it, then lets it go. Last night the young couple was up late, having a long and insightful conversation about their plans for a future together. “Thank you for last night,” says Daryl, who is still short on words because he left his travel mug of coffee on the bookshelf by the door this morning. “Even though I’m tired now. Green light. ” Daryl accelerates. “Do we have any food at home, in case Debra gets hungry?” “Debra will find something. And she eats anything. ” “This is true. ” Daryl sees that there are no open parking spots near the café. He turns on his hazard lights and waves for the car behind them to drive around. Jess grabs her purse. “I’ll see you tonight. I love you,” she says. She shuts the door. Feeling uncomfortable about blocking the flow of traffic, Daryl merges with the passing cars as quickly as he can. He is disoriented by the suddenness of his girlfriend’s departure, but understands that she still loves him. Everything is fine. * Debra is the only human about whom Kitty, in this life, has ever felt this way. There is no clear reason for Kitty’s hatred, but each observation that she makes about the woman seems to add to it. Debra smells different from Jess and Daryl: a stale, unpleasing odor hovers about her. She makes loud, groaning noises at random moments. Her footsteps cause the floors to vibrate and the tables to shake. Kitty feels strongly compelled to pin the human down—to possess her and, to a lesser extent, to eat her. “Oh, hey, crazy,” says Debra to Kitty. “I didn’t see you there. ” Kitty stares. “You don’t look very glad to see me. ” Kitty hisses. Debra kicks off her shoes. She takes off her sweatshirt, too, then throws it onto her backpack. She hops from the living room’s hardwood floor onto the checkered kitchen tile. She isn’t sure what it is that she would like to eat—perhaps a burrito, perhaps a frozen pizza, perhaps some tortellini. For a moment, everything is quiet enough that she is able to relax. Sunbeams sneak in through curtains. Jess and Daryl are not like her other friends: most don’t hang curtains, but use blinds or tapestries or nothing at all. It seems to Debra that she has become this particular couple’s only real, close friend. She doesn’t understand how they’ve grown into the sort of lifestyle that they lead now. It’s sort of sad—so blank-feeling—but sort of nice—so secure-seeming—at the same time. The couple has a lease on this apartment. How do young lovers put aside their differences enough to settle in together? she wonders. Kitty swipes at the human’s bare ankle. Debra growls and kicks at her. Kitty is not hurt, but still retreats. * Jess was mistaken in thinking that she had been scheduled to work at 9. She should have guessed this: the routine at the café is almost always the same. One opener comes in to handle the morning customers, then the next employee doesn’t start his or her shift until 10. Will she happen upon anyone she knows, here on the sidewalk? She feels certain that she will. It’s been a long time since Jess was last idle here, walking the streets with no destination in mind. She smiles, reminiscing about her misspent youth. She is more at peace, these days, than she ever was before. From above, Mr. Squirrel glares. He sees the confidence in her walk and becomes jealous. He is an angry squirrel. He climbs down from the tree in order to get a closer view. * Daryl hopes that someday soon, he and Jess will find a circle of friends to accept them. Certainly they have likable qualities. They are open-minded and compassionate. They can discuss contemporary music and politics. Jess cooks and plays the mandolin. Daryl likes to decorate his living spaces and occasionally updates an online comic strip. Neither is unattractive. Daryl drives north in the direction of St. Paul. In the back seat of his car is a laptop computer, an over-generous gift given to him by his grandparents upon his completion of an Associate’s Degree. His plan is to sit in his favorite bagel shop for 90 minutes or so, revising his resumé before beginning a shift at the pizza restaurant. If, in the near future, he can find some sort of part-time work that pertains to his field of interest—and if he can keep such work while also continuing to make pizzas—then he will feel more confident that he will not need to remain in food service for the rest of his life. Today, he is scheduled to work for only five hours. After the shift ends, he will drive to pick up Jess. He will wait for about an hour in the café where she works, until she clocks out and they return home. By that time, Debra will probably have left the house to go out to some party. * Mr. Squirrel watches people. He always finds new reasons to be angry at them. Why is that woman smiling? What is there to be happy about? Mr. Squirrel knows the answer—she has nothing at all to be happy about. Humans are stupid. Call it jealousy if you will, Mr. Squirrel says to the woman. Yes, call it jealousy, little miss I-can-smile-because-life-for-me-is-not-a-desperate-struggle-for-survival, but why can you not even look an unhappy squirrel in the eye? Why will you not even bother to notice? When I find a way, I am going to kill you dead, woman. I am cold. I would show you no sympathy. You are going to wish that you had paid me some attention. * After some time, Kitty’s foe lies down to try to sleep. She is more vulnerable to attack now, but still not vulnerable enough for Kitty to kill. Even a wounded human could win easily in a fight with a housecat. Kitty watches, not without some pleasure, as the mosquito, which was earlier feasting on cat’s blood, sucks at Debra’s arm. This continues until the woman kills the insect dead with one movement of her hand. Kitty stares. Cats cannot be poets. The young woman’s eyes half-open slowly. She and the cat squint, unblinking, at each other. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "body": "2018/01/17 - She touches one of the skateboarders. “Take us to San Francisco!” “No. ” “Then give us a Kamel Red!” “Give me some of your. ” He looks around. “Come on. ” Alicia is already walking around the corner for more privacy. She waves for him to follow. “Cigarette first! Gets you. ” Whispering. “Higher. ” Yelling. “Higher!” “Where’d you come from, anyway? And Mr. All Black. ” Sebastian, vulnerable and with baby cheeks, his brothers always teased him for skating with the white kids in their Sublime tee shirts, and now he’s hanging out with these two, who don’t skate but are always around. He genuinely forgets what states they’re from, midwest or east coast. Mark looks down at his feet, follows behind, bending his knees as little as possible, making long strides. Silently playful, but no smiles. Hasn’t been eating. Anorexic, probably, but denies it up and down. Alicia in the lead, baggy cargo shorts she’s reaching into. Leans against the wall, not an alleyway but an inconvenient section of the parking lot, shallow breaths. Tank top, thick ankles, baby blue tennis shoes, pink skin. Rolling a J. She’s not the best at it but she’ll get it done. “Mark doesn’t like the marijuana,” says our heroine. “Sometimes I do,” says our hero, pacing, not watching. He tried it twice, both occasions only recently. Felt nothing the first time. The second time freaked out at feeling out of control. “He should get used to it around here,” Sebastian says. He waves a cigarette toward Mark. “You want this, Mr. Black?” “Nummy. ” Sticks the Kamel between his lips, sucks it until the filter is probably all brown, skips his feet across the cement. “Yeah. ” Sebastian wondering where this one’s spaceship crashed. “The cancer is real nummy. ” “Mark doesn’t have to get used to things here, because he’s coming with me to Minneapolis!” Alicia hands Sebastian the joint. “Sounds fucking terrible. ” Our hero has a slight aversion to harsh language, remembering family. The usual violence. Community-sanctioned physical abuse, arbitrarily rationalized, ritualistic in its form. But mostly unstable adults, in this case Mark’s parents, responding to the slightest disagreement with raised voices, name-calling, continuing to scream until exhaustion led them apart again, each to their preferred television. Only schoolchildren could handle their emotions, was the lesson. Babies and grown-ups were out of control, but the fourth graders knew to raise their hands, sit all day, avoid talking back. When life got most difficult for Mark was when his peers grew up while only he stayed mature. He continues to suck on the cigarette like it’s a milkshake straw. “It seemed pretty nice, actually. When I passed through on the bus. I had to stay there eight hours because the bus that brought me in was late and I missed the connection. ” Nobody cares. Our heroine wants to show off the bookstores out there, where to get coffee, and she wants to dress our hero in absurd hats and feather boas, traipsing parallel and in step. And he would appreciate meeting her friends from back home, several of whom had moved up from Cannon Falls into city apartments, who now did things like photograph bands or work tech support for a local Internet service provider. “Minneapolis actually rocks,” she says. Sebastian closes his silver Zippo. Still holding his breath, he looks at what he’s smoking. Finally he opens his mouth. “I hope they’ve got better than this schwag. ” Mark waves off a pass. Alicia takes it instead, pulling out her own lighter. “Actually. ” Sebastian thinking about Marcy, that girl from Santa Cruz, met that one time at a house party thing, at a drum circle in somebody’s backyard, when he was just pacing around, certainly not drumming, slightly drunk and substantially bored. Can’t remember why she even came here to Fresno, girl was from Canada, liked to talk high school Spanish to him and ask him to correct her. Flirtatious still. Chatting on AOL, saying come up here anytime, come stay with me, I’m lonely. “I’d take you to Santa Cruz. ” Mark nods amenably. Alicia’s eyes light up. When she’s finished inhaling she’s like, “Eeeee! Thank you!” and waits for his posture to consent before she hugs him with an appropriately measured enthusiasm. * Getting out of town in an ancient car with no air conditioning, just windows you have to crank hard to get down, and then it’s hot air blowing all your shit around, and if you’re in the back seat and want to smoke there’s just no way unless you get the front seat people to roll their windows up so the cherry won’t fly off immediately and burn through the seats. Blue blue blue sky, though, and the promise of going away forever, farther away, away once removed. “I love that to get to the midwest you’re going to the beach. ” “I don’t think of it as the midwest. ” “Well, it’s not the Pacific Ocean, which is what we’re driving toward. ” “If you see signs for a Chinese restaurant, let me know. ” Our hero, Mark, hoping to find white rice. He doesn’t trust fad diets, laughs at the Atkins Diet people believing steak to be healthier than pasta. But never asked for his little pokey boobs, wants to fit into smaller jeans, so just eats as plainly as he can. White rice, after all, is delicious, simple, pure. He can walk for hours after just a small side of it. So he eats rice or, if he cannot find rice, cheese sandwiches with only vegetables, no condiments. “Or a sandwich place, I guess. ” And he narrates to himself sometimes as the hills in their weirdo California yellow-and-brownness but also greenness fly by. When you are not currently in the habit of freeway rides. You see how much there is to have pass by you. There is so much to love that you’re supposed to pretend to not love. This is how rebels light up into the night. “Bitch,” says Sebastian when a white lady cuts him off. “Who actually drives. A new BMW. Who?” Guess that’s a type of car, Mark thinks. Alicia would tie a ponytail, but it’s at that length. Pigtails or nothing, and today she chooses nothing. Disgusting toes, but sandals are a promise. She costumes as the type of person about to have an amazing day. As a strategy it often works. So, no shame that the stubby toes in her leather sandals look like marshmallows in bondage wear. “Who’s this band?” and it’s our favorite band. We haven’t heard of them yet.

    "title": "The Curmudgeon",
    "body": "2018/01/16 - The curmudgeon’s face was not immediately visible as I stepped outside to breathe the still autumn air. He was clinging to the handrail, his torso upon the first two steps, his legs flailing unhappily upon muddy leaves. “Are you dying?” I asked, when I noticed him. “This is, uh. This is me taking a rest,” he responded, “I’m, you know. Trying to forget about mankind’s imminent demise. ” I whistled my exhalation. “Hoo-boy. Yeah, I know how that goes. ” We made some small talk about mankind’s imminent demise. Then I started telling him about Jess, who was passed out on my futon at the time. And how my buddy Matt had been trying to hook me up with her, but how I was a little weirded out and uncertain about the whole situation. I would have offered the curmudgeon a pillow; but because he was my elder, I didn’t want to imply that he wasn’t able to take care of himself. So I was kind of just talking to fill the silence. I said, “Yeah, so this girl Jess and I were debating for like an hour about game systems. I don’t even know where Matt found this girl, but she at first seemed to know what she was talking about. She wouldn’t cede to my point about the obviously superior not only graphics handling et cetera but the quality of the third party licensing, but all this time I’m just assuming—and here is where I err, because, as I said, it seemed she knew what she was talking about—that she’s actually, you know, played the system in question? And it only occurs to me, because after all this time—an hour!—we’re talking, and she says—here, I quote: ‘Well, I haven’t actually played your system anyway. ’ So what are you doing railing against it for half an hour? An hour. It’s absolutely mind-boggling. But what Matt said is that she does this, any opportunity she has to argue with you about something, she’ll do it, doesn’t matter the topic. So I tell her: ‘While I appreciate your debating skills, and I thank you for the conversation, you really can’t talk. You haven’t played it. ’ She hadn’t played it! But it’s cool. It was a good time, she seemed all right still. So we take off, it’s me, her and Matt in Matt’s car, and we drive back here, figure we’ll watch a movie or something. ” Finally, the old man lifted an arm from the handrail. “Let me tell you,” he said, “I’m a hopeless, bitter old man. I would cough here just to exercise, to demonstrate more eloquently—plus elegante. Uh. Plus elegante-ment. That I am a broken piece of. Piece of nothing. Nothing in pieces. And devastated. But people of your age have no idea. No idea. You can program your damn computers, but you can’t see America. And you can’t see me because I’m nothing in pieces. ” A sudden sigh. “It wasn’t easy, you know, getting to be a curmudgeon. ” “Is that what you are? I thought it rude to ask. ” “That’s me. Your good old reliable local curmudgeon. Crusty and miserly, self-certain but powerless. Unhappy and stoic. All the time. ” “Right on,” I said. Then, suddenly, he grabbed an empty bottle from the recycle bin, smashed it, held it to my throat, and demanded that I inject heroin as part of a cultic ritual for the Etruscan god Maris. Refusing, I shocked him with my Civilian Taser, which killed him. His body was falling on me; I pushed it onto the porch steps, dropped the taser and did that thing that I do with my hands to express disgust at having touched something so unfortuitous as a corpse. I was solemn, because the killing even of an insane curmudgeon is not to be engaged in without the proper respects. * “Jess,” I said, kneeling by the futon, “Wake up. I’ve killed a curmudgeon in self-defense. ” “Mmm. No! Nathan, babe, I’m sleeping,” she said, “You should sleep too. ” An arm waved in my general direction, as though hoping to pull me nearer to her. I knew this action to be one of clever seduction: Matt had happened to mention that she does this when she wants a guy. Which is cool. We all have our methods, you know. Even if she was exaggerating her sleepiness, I figured that she was genuinely the sort of person who would want to be woken up gradually, so I climbed onto the futon and confidently stroked her hair. Her hand clasped upon my manly bicep and squeezed it. Then was the sex scene. After, I returned to the subject at hand: “So I still have to figure out what to do about the dead guy. ” “Yeah, what’s up with that? A curmudgeon attacked you?” “Yeah. It was weird. ” “Do we have to be solemn?” “No. Not for self-defense. I was for like a second, though, just because. ” “Yeah. ” Then I realized: “Aw, no. Tomorrow’s Sunday. And Monday’s a holiday. ” Jess slapped the front of her face with one hand. * There are many reasons for my wanting to get out of this stupid town. A new reason was added to the list once I had killed a man: everything closes on Sundays and holidays, including the Funerales. I called 9-1-1. They scolded me: “Couldn’t you just web search the FAQ for the local Funerales?” I would have considered this option, but Jess was still naked and I wanted to stare at her. Apparently, I was going to have to buy some Prolonger from the Wal-Mart—with my own money!—to keep the corpse undead for a few days. If I were to leave the body as it was until Tuesday, it would begin to get maggoty and I would have to pay a significant Decomposition Fee. As Charlie Brown would say: Aaugh! * I remember how this one time, Matt wrote an ode to Wal-Mart. It was awesome. It got published in a really reputable literary journal. It was a little bit over my head, because I haven’t read as many books as he has, but I know that it included a lot of references to older works. It was in part patterned after “Ode on a Grecian Urn”—which I have, actually, read—and it was meant to say that people, we all pass through the aisles of this store with many examples of art from around the world, like from China or Bangladesh, but we just don’t stop to appreciate it. Also, we can never truly understand the significance of a shirt that was made in a really different place from us. Cultural difference obscures the essence of a thing, just as thoroughly as does the passage of time. That’s why everyone needs to choose from the same books and speak in the same language: otherwise, there would be a never-ending series of little wars, instead of just the big, occasional, and important wars that have been leading us toward mankind’s imminent demise. When Matt explained this all to me, I told him that I already knew he was really smart, and that he should stop showing off. He explained that in heaven, after everyone’s demise, we would all be smart like him. I told him that heaven sounded boring. Being a writer, he only frowned. * Finally, Jess and I went inside and got the stuff. Working at the checkout counter was a girl who usually works in the electronics department. She asked whether I had played any good video games lately. I replied that I always played good video games, and that in fact only the best of video games were ever good enough for me. She asked whether I had delivered any good pizzas lately. I told her that I hadn’t, because our pizzas are disgusting and I have never been able to fathom how anyone in the world could ever eat them. She said that she disagreed, she liked our pizzas, and that moreover she liked having cute boys in their work clothes knock at her door with a pie in one hand and a 2-liter bottle of her favorite brand of cola in the other. She said that she wished she could get a pizza delivered during her break from work—which she was about to take—but that, because all the pizza places were closed at this hour of the night, she was going to have to settle for leftover vegetable fried rice and perhaps a snack cake from the vending machine. I was required to tell her that I loved snack cakes. Once I did, I was officially flirting with her and needed to dismiss my companion. “Okay, Jess,” I said, “Here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to walk back to my place with the Prolonger. I don’t know how good you are at lifting corpses. You can wake up Matt if you need to. He’ll help you to carry it into the dungeon. Oh, and the dungeon will be locked, but the key’s hanging up in the kitchen with all the other keys. It should be marked ‘dungeon key’. The same key works to get inside there and to shut the steel cage. Just set down the corpse. Use the Prolonger. There are instructions in the box for how to prepare the syringe and stuff. He’ll start screaming. That’s how you’ll know it’s working. Then lock up the cage. Oh, and be sure the door is closed while you’re in there, so that the soundproofing works and no one gets woken up. I’ll pay you $25 for your labors, and what’s the fine for heartbreak on the first night?’ “$75,” she said. “Right. And $75. I’ll just put them together in a $100 money order. ” She left. I was solemn, because even on the first night, heartbreak is not be engaged in without the proper respects. * Sitting on a bench in front of the Wal-Mart, eating snack cakes, I recounted for the cashier the night’s events. She seemed interested in the story of the curmudgeon, but wasn’t saying much in particular. I again was talking to fill the silence: “I can only imagine what Matt’s going to say about all of this. Writers are so weird. I guess most of them are raised by their parents, like out in the woods. That’s probably it. They come to the towns and they have to get used to everything. When he hears about the curmudgeon, I can promise you, he’s going to say something to make the matter seem significant. Every time somebody does something random or crazy, he gets, like, a faraway expression, and he thinks and thinks until he can somehow manage to explain it. ” “I’m feeling disturbed,” suddenly volunteered the cashier, whose name I kept forgetting to ask. “Customers have been talking a lot to me about the Family Center, as though something’s going on with it. People who have relatives there have been talking to me about how they can’t visit their parents anymore. They say that they’re not convinced that their parents are still alive. They say that sometimes, when they go to the elevator of the place, they can hear screams from below. They say that the guards are panicking and talking on walkie-talkies and turning away everyone who wants to visit. Again and again, I hear these stories. If I were hearing so many weird stories about a human being, I would assume that they were going crazy, you know? So I get worried. I’ve always believed that the Family Center provides an important service—to ease the transitioning of the former Tribalists into our society. Maybe you don’t know what that means. I know that most of us don’t really understand what the Family Center does. It’s just something that’s there. But I’ve actually started looking into it. Books and stuff. It’s kind of interesting. I’m sorry. This isn’t how I talk to most of my customers. But then, I don’t flirt with most of my customers. That’s what bars are for. I’ve been wanting to flirt with you for a long time, you know. Thanks for breaking that other girl’s heart. I know it can get expensive. Did you ever feel like someone was different? Not different as in crazy, but different in the sort of way that looking them isn’t like looking other people who have the same career. This is all so difficult to say. I feel different when I see you. ” A moth danced briefly along the scrunchie that was keeping her hair in a ponytail. I figured that the most polite thing to do was to stare into her eyes, trying to smile and nod. Meanwhile, I was imagining that Jess was inside my house, carrying the curmudgeon to the dungeon with Matt’s help. Soon, the corpse would be alive again, screaming at first but then mostly just gurgling stiffly. Matt would touch Jess’s cute little butt through her gray sweatpants. Then, they would have their own sex scene. Tomorrow, Matt would wax poetic about how in heaven, everybody’s souls would already be intermingled, and so we wouldn’t be obliged to pursue penile-vaginal intercourse anymore. That idea would be small consolation: I was still going to have to be jealous whenever I saw them together. And I was stuck on a bench with this creepy cashier, who was going on and on about subjects that were really not okay at all. I was really starting to worry: she was sounding more and more like a traitor. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "title": "Salvatore and the Cyclone",
    "body": "2018/01/15 - I hated fireworks, but Dorothy loved them, and I loved her, and I was in Kansas now. “Oh, Toto!” she exclaimed, “Isn’t this wonderful!” I hid myself beneath the blanket, shivering in exaggerated fear. I pushed my face into the grass. “Toto! You don’t have to be afraid! It’s a celebration!” My expulsion from Oz had not seemed like such a bad thing, initially. Kansas had presented me with an array of curious smells, animal and plant life, and curious technology. The lack of magic in Kansas was sobering, it’s true, but seeing how folks could live so simply was also inspiring. The ingenuity of these people had kept me entranced for the first several months. “You know that I would never take you anywhere you’d be in danger!” Dorothy picked me up and held me against her. I breathed onto her neck. I wondered how she would react if she could feel what I was feeling. Although I was still quite young—even for a dog—I was a literal world away from my former innocence. I had begun to see that it was my homeland which had kept me feeling real and certain of my virtues. In Oz, I had been certain that I was powerful, and the world around me had agreed; now, in Kansas, I was simply a house pet. I licked tentatively at Dorothy’s face until the next round of explosions. * I didn’t care much for the hot summer, but at least Aunt Em and Uncle Henry found a renewed interest in me when they were sweating and tired and aspiring to move as little as possible. They called me with the name they had chosen for me—“Toto! Toto!”—which was an odd choice, an appellation that I had always believed was short for Salvatore. Did they think that I had come to them from Italy? But it didn’t matter: whatever they thought they knew about my origins, they were wrong. My home was a place that they did not, would not, and could not believe existed. Only in Dorothy did I see the potential to visit Oz. Because she was still a child, her mind was yet free from the guilt and fear which had trapped her custodial guardians inside their dull little Kansan world. I saw Dorothy’s imagination as my one chance to circumvent the evil curse that had been placed on me. Although a powerful magic prevented me from returning myself home, I believed that this little farm girl might be able to do the job for me. I still had some affection for the other family members, of course. In their residence I could always trust that a lap would be safe to sit in, a whistle would be safe to answer, and an empty food bowl would soon enough be refilled. All around me were good people, and when my mood allowed for it I could respect that the different culture I was experiencing was just that—a culture, handed down from generation to generation, occasionally refined but inevitably regenerated. Dorothy, too, would someday end up resembling her parents, inheriting their resignation and prejudices. To blame Aunt Em and Uncle Henry for their atrophied imaginations would have been like howling at the milk for curdling—both futile and absurd. So, I licked everyone. I put forth enthusiasm. I smiled and barked and wagged my little tail. They petted me and scratched me, and I enjoyed that. I kept up a positive attitude through what they called the “dog days”; I did this by relishing the smallest pleasures, but also by assuring myself that I would not sit through them here again. * My troubles in Oz had been the result of brashness on my part—brashness, arrogance, and in general an overdeveloped confidence in my own magical powers. It seemed almost funny to think about, now—Toto, the cute little terrier, having any sort of power at all. The longer I spent in this new role of mine, the more difficult it became to remember the old me. When I made an effort to recollect the poise, the seriousness, the grandeur which I had once possessed, my feeling that these qualities might be slipping away forever brought about a panic in me. If I did not act quickly, I felt, I might never be able to act at all. At the same time, I found myself wondering whether this feeling of urgency itself might be a re-emergence of that old and destructive brashness, the very trait of mine which had led me to my present circumstances. Which was the greater danger to me, inactivity or lack of restraint? Doubt, having seeped into my mind, coated and obscured every thought about myself that I had. It was a confusing time. * One thing I was sure about was that I wanted to use a tornado. Kansas, it turns out, sees quite a number of these occurring naturally in any given year. It was a risky idea, but if on a stormy day (when the conditions would make it easier to summon and control a funnel cloud) I could introduce to Dorothy’s mind the associations that would be necessary for her to visualize Oz, then the state of terror which an approaching cyclone would be certain to rouse in her might reduce her psychic defenses, giving me the opportunity to invade her mind and trigger her usually dormant magical powers, sending us both away to Oz. This plan, basic though it was, involved unknowable variables. I had never used anything more potent than a mild charm on the young Dorothy, and I preferred not to attempt any serious magic on her unless it was for good reason. Even a well-cast mind-spell with no complications would leave this girl feeling disoriented and give her an intuition that I had done something to her. Such side effects were simply too much of a risk, considering that I was counting on her trust and affection remaining strong enough in the face of an oncoming twister to ensure that she would not abandon me. * I developed my plans for escape when the family was away or distracted from me. I was different when I was alone; I was brooding and dark, and I gravitated to window-less corners in which I could chomp on a bone, stare at the wall, and lose myself in thought without too much sensory distraction. Although I spent the vast majority of that summer frolicking or cuddling with Dorothy, the truth is that what I remember most vividly from those times are my secret and solitary retreats into myself. In retrospect, I recognize that the darkness I felt at these times was a reaction against the carefree life to which I was, more than I wanted to admit to myself, beginning to grow accustomed; but at the time, it felt not only natural but necessary for me to let such melancholy wash over me. The days were passing quickly, regardless. It wasn’t long before the storm that I had been waiting for approached. * I was a little dog running. The winds screamed and spat, shoving and humiliating me. The dust came alive and made me blind. This wasn’t right. This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen. In the moment, I was terrified; I was lost; I was a household pet acting against his instincts. I was bringing Dorothy into danger. Where had the hero in me vanished to? Nature was slapping me in the face, but I couldn’t look back. I was committed now. I was the leader in a chain of desperate pursuit, Uncle Henry chasing Dorothy chasing me chasing my home. The cyclone chased us all. The funnel was an indiscriminate thing, a heartless marriage of force and trajectory. Here is how I had envisioned this day: we would all be inside the house. Everywhere we looked we would see gray, but nowhere more than outside, where the clouds would suddenly be darkening. From the porch Uncle Henry would call to his wife: “There’s a cyclone coming!” He would run off to the shed where the cows and horses were kept, wishing to look after the stock. Aunt Em would drop her work, look outside, and then immediately begin to run for the cellar. “Dorothy!” she would scream, but Dorothy would be chasing after me. In the moment before the cyclone hit, I would tap in to the young girl’s mind… That had been the idea, but things were not going according to plan. I had not created this funnel at all: it had developed on its own in our vicinity, and I had only suggested a direction for it. Its timing had been inauspicious. Dorothy and I had been away at the time the cyclone developed, and we had needed to hurry back on foot to make it back to the farm. Everyone would have been okay if Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had not still been waiting at the storm cellar door for Dorothy to arrive. I had underestimated what the two adults would risk for their niece; when Uncle Henry was hit by debris and Dorothy saw him fallen, gashed and unconscious, she bellowed and I stopped and I turned around and after wiping my eyes with my paws I could see my little Kansan girl, who had been so good to me, dropping to her knees and digging her ten clutched fingers hysterically into pigtailed hair. Suddenly, it was she who was terrified and lost. My emotions at witnessing this scene might have immobilized and killed me, too, had I not projected these feelings at her in one loud and magical howl. Did I ever truly love Dorothy, I wondered, if I could now, for my own sake, sacrifice her this way? Although she already was paralyzed by a sudden recognition that her father, unconscious in the path of a quickly approaching tornado, could not possibly survive, what sealed her own fate was my use of magic on her. The emotions that I had begun to feel—the terror and guilt which had started to cloud my mind and put my own survival at risk –- were lifted from me and weighed upon her. The most horrific moment of her life was now, for her, doubly petrifying. I paused briefly in consideration of what I had done, but when the sky began to hail, I again started running. I ran the remaining distance to the door of the house. The porch door was closed, but it was a simple use of magic to break it away. I closed my eyes and began to visualize a new life for myself. I could not return to Oz, but I could not remain in Kansas, either—not anymore, with Dorothy and Uncle Henry left to die, and with the twister about to bear down on me as well. The frail little house was lifted off the ground. The curse of the evil wizard meant that I would still not be able return home, but I had no choice, now, but to magically transport myself away to another new land. How many times could this happen to me? My only wish had been to return to where I was admired and respected… but here I was, in this all-too-familiar situation, guilty once more. Here I was, with my scheming arrogance tearing apart my life, forcing me to run away to another humiliating new world, another place that could never be my home.

    "title": "Wormleysburg Variety #3: Blue-hair and the Maglev",
    "body": "2018/01/14 - I am woozy by the time I’m in the driveway. I would use my walker for this, but it is inside the ground level of the house. So I will only have my cane. I am placing an abnormal amount of weight on it, holding it to the front of me. I may be bruising my hands, but it’s better for me to hurry than it would be for me to lose my momentum. While I am walking I should remain walking. The store is in sight. Why do we need all this dirt, all this gravel, all these vehicle lots? All this distance. Why, Wormleysburg? Answer me that. I do not yet see the taxi cab. I do see a young person in the parking lot of the closed variety store. She stands by the store’s landing pad and looks up. Her long hair is colored electric blue. I continue my forward walking. I have forever been an introvert, yet I have never been shy or anxious. Some blue-haired she-person does not particularly frighten me, even if she is waiting for an illegal drone, which perhaps this one is not, although she appears to be, standing at the landing pad like this. I have knowingly approached a polar bear before. I was never this frail when I was a world traveler, but my nerves to some extent forget this. Blue-hair looks at me, then back up at the sky. I speak to her before she speaks to me: “Old man just waiting for a ride. ” “Good evening,” she says back to me. She displays less concern than I was expecting. She advises me casually: “Stand by the building. You’ll avoid some of the snow. ” “Nowhere to sit, is there,” I say, too tired and focused on ambulating to pitch my voice and imply a question mark. “Trash can,” she says, motioning to an overturned steel receptacle about two feet high. “But nothing comfortable, no. ” “Wa-hoo,” I say. As she suggested, I walk myself up next to the glass window of the store. An unattractive animated etching of the words “Wormleysburg Variety” draws itself on the glass in a sort of cursive script, then blinks twice, then repeats. Also displayed in the window are advertisements for food and beverage products, skin creams, and paper supplies. I keep walking even after I have found this bit of shelter, because standing still would be even more difficult for me than continuing to walk. When I reach the locked freezer full of of ice for sale, I turn around with great effort and walk back in the direction of Blue-hair. “Where are you going?” she asks me, once I am facing her again. “I’m going into my hundreds,” I say. “Geographically, I’m not so picky, but I expect to travel a great distance. ” “And you’re waiting for a cab?” “I’m waiting for a cab to take me to the transit hub. ” “And it’s picking you up here?” “That was the arrangement, yes. ” “Then ride with me instead. Does your intervisual work? Look me up. I’m registered for rideshares. ” She should speak more slowly, I think to myself. It’s enjoyable to pause and take a breath every now and again. “I’m old. I’ve got an inter-nothing. What do you want from me?” She looks up again from next to the landing pad and says, “I just want to get out of Pennsylvania. ” “Ow. Shit. Ow,” I say. I lean my left shoulder against the side of the building. “Where is your vehicle?” “Trash can,” she says. She points a thumb toward the same receptacle she referred to previously. “But it propels two if I tie a sled to it. ” Registering my surprise, she adds, “What, you thought it was for compost or something?” She is amused that I would see a trash can and believe it to be for the disposal of trash. I dislike young people sometimes. They have no sense of history. This was true of me and my siblings in the 1970s, and it is especially true of kids now. “One thing that you should know about the very old,” I say. “You can’t torture us into giving you things. We’re already in pain, and we just die if you try to hurt us even more. ” Blue-hair smiles, unphased by my attempt at dark humor. “No torture. All I want is to travel on your passport. Aside from that, I’ll pay for everything. Fuck this cab company, anyway. They should have been here by now. ” “If you can give me somewhere to sit. Yes. Shit. Fine. Make it quick. Shit,” I say, as eloquently as my pain will allow. Blue-hair turns the trash can upside-down, then helps me to sit on it. “I live just down the next side road,” she says. “If I walk alongside and support you, do you think you could handle floating down there? We’ll float along the shoulder, with our blinkers on. ” “Wa-hoo,” I say. “I’ll take that as a yes. ” She holds my cane under her arm. She supports my trunk and holds on to my left hand. The vehicle lifts up from the ground and floats at a speed that I am certain seems obnoxiously slow to a young person.

    "title": "Eric in Los Angeles #2: The Illusionist's Marriage",
    "body": "2018/01/13 - “Eric!” Eric’s wife, Jamie, called out as soon as Eric had walked in the door. Drenched in light—for the sun was just then setting over the ocean, and the ocean was visible from the door of this recently-purchased estate—he dropped his messenger bag and followed her voice into the morning room. “How many people are here?” He could hear not only the usual three or four voices echoing, but at least a dozen. “Eric! So good to see you!” said a voice from someplace he could not escape. Jessica, he thought, was made up and put together. He whispered to her. “Is Jamie entertaining?” Jessica wanted to make a joke about the multiple meanings of the word, “entertaining”. Eric saw that she was doing this and was immediately bored. She was not in the business; she was a math genius. Mathematicians were thorough, but an illusionist was quick. A moment of someone else’s indecision could feel like an eternity. Eric’s index finger drew a fast line down the hairs of her arm as he walked away. He called to his wife, who was not in this room and so was presumably in the kitchen: “Jamie!” * Their wedding had taken place sixteen months before, in Malibu. Their new home had been purchased more recently. This was apparently the housewarming. He had been told about it many times. 	Whatever. He put on a jacket and walked around. Who were all of these people? What a bizarre and random guest list. He didn’t want to talk with anyone, really. * Eric gently inserted his hand within his wife’s grip. “Darling. Darling,” he said. This was an old-timey affectation. Those who did not know much about the couple’s relationship thought the kiss that followed was inspiring. The couple looked happy. * Eric and Jaime had only ever really fought once—on the day they had moved into this home together. In with Jamie’s things had been a full-sized wardrobe, one she had been keeping at a self-storage place in Santa Monica. What was inside this wardrobe she had refused to say, no matter how many times Eric had asked. “My children are in there,” she had answered him, dryly. “From my last marriage. It’s okay—I slip them money once in a while. Don’t worry about it, Eric. Just put it in the shed or something. But I want to keep it. ” The entire house belonged to him, he had told her. It was an expensive home, even for him. It had been paid for with his money. He had found himself sitting outside on the steps, that day, in the middle of the last big rainstorm the Los Angeles area could remember. Covered by an awning he had sat, stone-faced and untouched, while the rest of the world drowned. * On nights like this one, when the two of them pretended together, Eric saw in Jamie’s eyes what he always saw, reversed and complicating—he saw a handsome image of himself. * And through the kitchen window, in the twilight, across a half acre of lawn and topiary, he also saw a little boy. Like so many little boys, this one was dressed in a superhero tee shirt. There was meaning to this, as there is to all things, even as the party continued and the adults got drunk and everything went to shit. And everybody smiled.

    "title": "The Doppelganger",
    "body": "2018/01/12 - One night at my favorite website for pornography, I discovered a tame but very appealing video clip of two boys kissing. One of the boys reminded me of myself, although his face was much prettier than mine. I watched this file six times in a row. I had never considered how surprising it would be to see a boy who somewhat resembled me in one of those videos. The boy who looked like me ran his fingers over the muscular torso of the other, more conventional-looking boy. I enjoyed watching the two of them kiss, and this desire made me think that maybe, too, in the right context, a stranger might enjoy looking at me, someday. The performance of my doppelganger was flawless. I had never seen anyone, either in real life or in an online video, look so excited, yet so attentive. He had carried the very essence of a productive life into that steamy makeout session. Uncomfortable with the depth of my introspection, but sensing it to be unavoidable, I turned off the computer and drank a tasty cola in silence. * My friend was in town for the weekend. She was planning to stop by. In order to prepare for her, I bathed. When people ask me why I bathe so frequently, I tell them that it I do it to relax. In truth, such a relaxation is not really an option for me. I know that there are folks out there who are able to relax easily, who keep their breathing shallow and regular even when they’re alone. I am not one of those people. In order to truly relax, I need to be pressed up against another human’s body, so that my breathing is regulated like that of an infant. Something in my blood makes me want to be held. * I am a strong person: I have never really broken down. If I did really break down, then someone would make a phone call to report that I was contemplating suicide, or that I was screaming in the streets for a violent uprising, and then before long some officers would lead me politely away to a small room within a part of the hospital set aside for our types, and there I would speculate about the stains on the floor and the wall and the chair. The stains would appear to be blood: of course there would have been blood there, from kids like the one who would be across the hall from me, the most beautiful blond-haired street kid in the world, a girl. This girl would be just young enough that I would immediately see her as a tragic, beautiful child, whom I should like to protect. The girl, sitting and keeping her bandaged wrists at length from the soft skin of her pink knees, would tell me that she had just been stupid this one night, and that underneath it all she knew that life must really be worth living, and that her injury had resulted from a relapse into addiction, against which she would need to struggle every day until she died. Our getting-to-know-yous would be interrupted when a tired-looking man would say hello to me, and the postures of the nurses would slink into subordination, and the man would ask me, how are you doing, and I would say something like, you know, sir, I am in Hell in this compartment, and I only wish that there were some window from which I could fly. From that day forward, for the rest of my life, I would know that that blond girl was me, and I would not be able to forget her pink knees, which for certain to me would symbolize something, and because of her I would want to stay alive. * After I finished bathing, my friend arrived. She was lovely. I smiled and sustained eye contact and did not let myself doubt that it was proper for me to do so. I hugged her through her hair and sweater. “How are you, darling?” she asked. I spoke in a casual tone: “Beautiful, now that you’re here!” I motioned her to the kitchen table, where I had set two glasses and a bottle of wine. “Do you know what he told me when I said that I was having wine with you?” she said. “He told me, ‘Don’t feel that you have to drive home tonight if you want to get sloshed. ’” The two of us laughed, because husbands trust me. * My friend and I spoke with each other, like friends, over a bottle of wine. For some reason, my mood descended as the conversation progressed. Before we were able to finish the bottle, she let me know that she was getting tired and that she would like to sleep on my bed. * I crept back to the laptop. I forced myself not to glance back too often in my friend’s direction. After I was certain that she was asleep I began to examine, again, the video clip of the boy who looked like me. He was kissing that other boy, but I could see that he wasn’t even really attracted to him. My doppelganger, I thought, was just a free spirit—the sort who believe in a distant hedonism despite themselves. I expected that before long, I would feel tired enough to lie down next to my friend. She was going to regulate my breathing. I would have a night of dreamful sleep. I should have been excited for this, but I wasn’t. I was thinking too much. Her hair draped over the side of the mattress. I wondered to myself what she would think if she were to awake to find me examining a video clip of boys kissing while she rested, sprawled across my bed sheets and wearing one of my old tee-shirts. Her eyelids opened suddenly, as though she had heard my thoughts. Surprised, I closed my laptop, but then I realized that only the whites of her eyes were visible. She was dreaming. The tee-shirt in which she slept was one that I didn’t wear very often. I commonly loaned it to friends when they slept over. *She was on her back. Through the quiet, I heard her tongue as it pushed the saliva in her mouth. Minutes passed. I thought that she was awake, sensing something, my eyes on her. Her breathing changed again. Her eyes were closed; her mouth was partially open. Her legs shined like utility poles in the lights from the open window. Maybe she was conscious, or maybe she wasn’t. I turned my back to her, opened the laptop, and clicked play. There again, stable as ever, was my pornographic self—the new, other me. He was as he had been before—touching his artful fingers along the ribcage of the more conventional-looking boy, presenting himself, ready and available, while everybody smiled.

    "title": "Eric & the Mannequins",
    "body": "2018/01/11 - Jamie-Q has written that there is a point at which a human identity fails—when a person has no choice but to re-invent him- or herself—and that the process of re-inventing one’s own identity is what sometimes leads to an adolescent development of superpowers. This sort of transformation is, she claims, a natural process, triggered in the mind as a reaction to outside circumstances. Although Eric disagrees with several of Jamie-Q’s conclusions—particularly her claim that anyone, if given the appropriate set of environmental circumstances, may have the potential to develop superpowers—he does value her ideas, and many of them resonate with him on a personal level. It has always seemed unlikely to him, after all, that theories of genetics could explain how he is able to bring mannequins to life, but why he cannot do the same with standees, statues or blow-up dolls. In a past that now seems distant, these two superheroes were romantically linked. Their relationship survived for ten months before ending in a mutually agreed upon, amiable split. Eric is privileged to know the well-guarded secret of what Jamie-Q’s superpower actually is—the uncanny ability to convince others, without trying, that she is a very powerful superhero. To save on gas, the two of them carpool to work. * On the day of the Connecticut TEAM meeting, Jamie-Q is the one behind the wheel. “I think Freddy’s going to talk to you about the mannequins today,” she says to Eric. “Have you been reading the journals lately?” “No,” he says, “Just a couple of blogs. I’m well aware that Superhero is against me. And Alter Ego. And Justice Quarterly. ” Eric has been the subject of controversy ever since word first spread that he might be “directly involved in the sexual activities of the Mannequin Legion, which he controls. ” He has paid enough attention to know that those in a position to take action against him have reached a consensus—their consensus being that many of his choices relating to the domestic livelihood of the Mannequin Legion seem “downright creepy… and a potential liability to the TEAM”, as one colleague noted. A fair explanation of the TEAM’s side of the story was told to an aspiring freelance journalist on the afternoon before the scheduled meeting. Jessica—a former acquaintance to Eric—had been asked to talk with a friend of Freddy, the TEAM Captain. Jessica was quoted as follows:  “As some in the media have caught wind of recently, one of the TEAM members may be living a questionable lifestyle. Eric—or The ManneKing, as he was previously known—has the power to bring mannequins to life. In superhero circles, this controversy started up some time ago, when evidence surfaced that suggested he might play some part in the sex lives of his Mannequin Legion. Although he insists that he never directly participates in sexual conduct with them—insists, in fact, that he has no inclination to be sexually involved with anyone anywhere, 	let alone with mannequins—a document has circulated that suggests he is 	a sort of moderator for activities of group sex that the mannequins are 	raised to take part in. The TEAM, of course, is usually willing to 	stand behind the right of its members to live their personal lives without 	discrimination or any passing of judgment; but the fact that Eric has in his power the ability to create life whenever and for whatever purpose he sees fit has forced the TEAM to consider some difficult questions. Although various resolutions, passed over the years, strictly limit how often and under what conditions he is allowed to bring mannequins to life, he has all this time been given no restrictions as to what he may do 	with the existing mannequins while not on official business. Most of the TEAM feels that something needs to be done about Eric. One complicating factor here, though, is that he is very sensitive to criticism and may think that the concerns his TEAMmates express are actually 	ill-intentioned personal attacks. What the TEAM, and various others 	who know Eric, have decided to do tomorrow is hopefully, all things 	considered, the safest option. A number of people who are or have been 	close with him—myself included—are gathering together to try to open 	up a dialogue with him. There will be no threat of official discipline; we 	just want to talk on a personal level. There is, however, a slight chance that he will take this the wrong way, and run off, and turn his Legion against the TEAM, and stop adhering to the regulations limiting the use of his powers—in which case, no one involved is likely to take the time out for interviews, because we’ll all be fighting an epic battle against him. ” * Had the interview not been scheduled at the last minute, and had the interviewer not been a trusted ally, Jessica would have been a strange choice to act as the voice for any TEAM endeavor. Jessica’s superpower allows her to freeze time; she once was a popular socialite among superheroes, but the TEAM was reluctant to recruit her because her participation would have caused friction to certain alliances between the United States Department of Superheroes—of which Connecticut’s Tertiary Engagement Against Malevolence (TEAM) is an ongoing operation—and the scientific community in general, whose established theories Jessica’s superpowers appear upon inspection to contradict. Eric still feels sentimental about Jessica, even though he hasn’t seen her since a New Year’s Eve party 4 1/2 years ago—when, under the influence of a few drinks and a complex period of her life, she verbally assaulted him, threw his stemware at the wall, and stormed out from his mansion in tears. She always did seem to him rather unpredictable, her demeanor being at one moment grounded and professional, then at the next impulsive and irrational. After that sticky New Year’s Eve, he decided to wait for her to call him (lest he run the risk of seeming too thick-headed to take a hint) but she never did call. When she last knew him, he still called himself The ManneKing; the Mannequin Legion had not yet convinced him of the name’s silliness. * “I’ve been doing some thinking,” says Jamie-Q to Eric, who so far during the car ride has not made eye contact with her. “If there’s a child somewhere, with superpowers, who wants to make a difference, that child’s going to look at us and say, ‘I want to do what they do. ’ And where are we leading that child through our example? Into institutions that as a matter of course suffocate what’s new and revolutionary. Why are we still a part of this game? Why do we have to be superheroes, if it’s not going to make a difference?” In his youth, Eric was always disciplined by his father. His mother was acquiescent and spoke little. Now an adult in control of dozens of mannequins who walk, breathe, and defend the homeland, Eric aspires to be neither too dominating nor too weak-seeming. His comfortable position in control of the domestic function of the Mannequin Legion, in addition to giving him a real sense of purpose, has allowed him to forget his deeply-rooted fear that a married life should turn him into his father, whom he despises, or his mother, who is a woman. This fear of commitment, along with his general disinterest in sexual activity, is well served by his current arrangement to the extent that he never anymore reminisces about how lovely Jamie-Q used to look when she would keep him up all night, trying to persuade him to make love to her. * The two superheroes park on-street in front of the old brick building that houses the TEAM office. They are buzzed inside. They walk up stairs. The secretary nods at them. They enter a room that is filled with Eric’s friends and colleagues. Only he and Jamie-Q are in costume. Jessica has been standing near the door. She stops time immediately. “Eric,” she says, her hand on his shoulder, “We’re here because Freddy and the higher-ups want to change how you run the Legion. The rest of us think that what you’re doing is probably fine—we trust your sense of ethics—but if we didn’t play along with this then we’d have no say in what was going on. So we’ve come up with a plan. I’m really sorry that I had to wait until now to explain this to you. I didn’t want you to try to run and hide from this. If you want to keep control of the Legion, and if you want to do it on your terms, you’re going to have to listen to me. Can you do that, Eric?” Eric does not immediately respond. Instead, he looks around the room. “You all came together into this tiny little room, all because of me?” “We can do it,” she says. “Now’s the time. We’ve tried to participate in rational discussion, but nobody’s really listening. I have a plan that can help you, if you’re willing to listen. ” * Jessica has no inside information about the sex lives of the mannequins. Only Jamie-Q and Eric himself know more than what was described in the document that began all the controversy. That document—a single page from Jamie-Q’s private diary discovered in the rec room of the previous, much nicer incarnation of the TEAM headquarters—had been handwritten, then crossed out with a giant X, then crumpled up and tossed haphazardly into the backpack from which it eventually, accidentally fell. It reads like a section of a memoir, as do most of Jamie-Q’s diary entries.  “Is there any Tang left in the fridge?” Eric asks from the bed. One of the mannequins, which has just concluded its sexual intercourse with a second mannequin, responds quickly: “There is no Tang left in the fridge. ” A third mannequin massages Eric’s back. “Tell me something,” it says, “About your TEAMmates. How do they do it?” (The mannequins will not talk with me, although they often, like this, allude to my presence. ) It continues: “You have such strength of character, and yet I can’t imagine how you would handle this career if it weren’t for your support system. ” Eric clears his throat. “They have support systems, too,” he explains to it patiently. “Theirs are just human instead of mannequin. ” A fourth mannequin, looking out at the crashing waves from its place on the windowsill, shows the closest thing to anger that I have seen from any of them: “But do they know what it means to preside over a love like this, in so beautiful a room, without ever an anxious or awkward moment? Do they hold any affection so deep as that which flows to each of us from you, Eric, who alone created us, who alone may sustain us, and who alone gives meaning to our lives?” Eric looks at me. I wish that he wouldn’t. So many times I’ve only wanted him to look at me, but not like this. It’s as if he’s wishing that I were a mannequin, wishing that life hadn’t corrupted me, wishing that he could have been in control of me from the time when I was born—in which case, he might now have some genuine feeling toward me. * “Will you listen to me?” asks Jessica, “I’m trying to help you here. ” Although Eric has recently felt uncomfortable in his costume, in the moment it gives him confidence. He stands tall and looks his old friend in the eye. If he moves her hand from his shoulder, he will be trapped in time along with the rest of the universe. It occurs to him that standing there, with this woman touching him, he has the opportunity to consider for a few extra moments how astonishing it is to be loved by mannequins. He says nothing.

    "title": "Nancy & Jester",
    "body": "2018/01/10 - During weekends at Auntie Emma’s house, my brother ate chicken nuggets. I often watched him lean over the tray table, forking nuggets—dragging them through the ketchup, disappearing them into his mouth using only a flick of the wrist. He looked like a juggler at the circus, so I knew that he was going to be a clown. * Sometimes, Auntie Emma and her boyfriend took us to the movies. This could be awkward, because my brother wasn’t comfortable around men. Pretending to examine a spot on my dress, I would watch him from the corner of my eye as he stared. If only I could cover that face in white make-up, I thought, it would be the happiest in the world. He was going to be the perfect clown. He was so little, so cute—confused, but talented. * He began trying to wear my clothes. I sat him down and explained, then, that it was not okay for him to wear my tights, because I was a girl and he was a clown. I told him that little girls were allowed to wear black tights, but that little clowns had to wear silly striped ones, in colors like pink and blue. He winced at my mention of the word, “clown”. I made a silent note to refer to him henceforth as a “jester” instead. This had a nice ring to it. I decided that it was his new name. * We went to the local courthouse. “Excuse me,” I said to the secretary, “Where can I file a Petition for Name Change? It’s for my brother. He’s 10 years old, but I’m 13, if that’s relevant. ” “You’ll need his parent or guardian to do that,” she told me. “Well, our mother never leaves the house,” I said, “And our dad’s dead. ” “Way dead,” Jester added. “I saw it happen. It was weird. ” “I’m sorry to hear that,” the lady told us, “But you’re not allowed to do that sort of thing for yourself until you’re 18. What’s the reason for the name change?” “Occupational,” I said proudly. “He’s going to be a clown. ” I patted Jester on the head. He smiled and nuzzled his head against my armpit. * That summer, my brother and I grew closer than ever. I gave up trying to change his name legally, but he got used to being called “Jester”. It suited him. * At the time, a local theater company was preparing an adaptation of my novel, Diary of a Little Girl. When Jester could take over my share of the housework, I visited with the cast and watched their rehearsals. I returned home late one night to find that Jester was lying awake in his bed and crying. “You were with Jason, weren’t you,” he said. This was a question, but he spoke it as a declaration. His pronunciation of the word, “you”, whistled through clenched teeth. “Yeah, he made me dinner. Did you miss me?” I sat down on his bed the way that parents do in the movies. “I told you that I might be out late tonight. ” “And how was dinner. ” It was as though he had forgotten how to raise the pitch of his voice when asking a question. “It was good. We had wine. Have you ever tried port?” “I’m ten years old. ” “Well, sure, but I’m 13. I don’t know what you’ve been doing at recess. ” “I’m also not a clown. There. I said it. ” His back was to me. I touched his arm. He pulled me next to him. Once I was holding him, the biggest sobs began. He breathed in short, violent gasps, so sudden and forceful that they reminded me of a flushing vacuum toilet. Maybe he was right. Maybe he wasn’t a clown—but he would be, in time. He was my brother, after all. I loved him. I wasn’t about to let him give up on his place in society. I would make him the greatest clown the world had ever known. * Jason was my first lover. Our involvement lasted until the cast party for Diary of a Little Girl. There, I took him aside and explained my situation—that I was going to begin work as a dishwasher, in order to buy private clowning lessons for my brother. Between working and taking care of the household, I would have neither the time nor the energy to maintain any sort of romance—let alone a romance that regularly required my assuaging the guilt of a 26-year-old who would collapse on my bosom and weep, “Thirteen! Thirteen!” while grasping feebly at his bed sheets. I’m not sure how I phrased this to Jason, exactly, except that I included the words “while grasping feebly”—these remained a running joke between me and Jester for some time. * I knew that it would take a small miracle for Jester to agree to clowning lessons. This miracle, I decided, would be the tutelage of the world-famous Socko the Clown. * I had correctly guessed that Socko, out of costume, would be a mean old man. I was therefore entirely prepared for the scowl that met me after I knocked on his door. “Mr. Sheriden, I presume?” “Yes,” he answered flatly, “And you are…?” “My name’s Nancy. ” I extended my hand. He received it uncertainly. “I’m a novelist. I know that it’s a bit unusual for me to visit unannounced, but I have a business proposal for you. ” “You’re a novelist. ” “I’m the author of Diary of a Little Girl. It was well-reviewed, but not so much a commercial success here in the States. I’m also a dishwasher on the side. And I’m starting the eighth grade soon. But what I’d like to talk with you about are my plans for a follow-up to the Diary. I’m not sure how familiar you are with presentation software”—I patted the laptop under my arm—“but I’ve put together some slides with PowerPoint that I think will help illustrate my proposal,” I breathed, “If I may be so bold as to request fifteen minutes of your time this afternoon. ” His expression was shifting into one of concern. He looked into my eyes, which were pointed toward his own but never focused. I avoided eye contact as a matter of course. His pretense was mollified. The old clown let me inside. * “Little girl. Nancy, did you say your name was?” I nodded. He looked confused. “What do your parents do for a living?” The fingers of his left hand massaged the palm of his right hand. He was leaning forward in his chair. The elastic in my socks had worn out, so I kept pulling at them. “My father died a few years ago,” I told him, “He was fishing with my brother in the middle of a lake and was struck by lightning. . ” He watched my eyes again. A few seconds later, he responded, “I’m so sorry, little girl. ” “I’m okay, but my brother gets flashbacks. ” “He was in the boat. ” “The death would be one thing. ” “But seeing it…” “No,” I said firmly, “That’s not it. He was 8 years old. He couldn’t drive a boat. He couldn’t swim: he only knew how to doggy paddle. And there was Dad, thrown into the water when he was hit. My brother didn’t know whether the body might be dead or alive. The flashbacks aren’t about what he saw; they’re about what he thought. Was Dad dying? Was he supposed to pull him out from the water? If he touched Dad, would he get electrocuted, too? Should he try to do CPR? Should he doggy-paddle to the shore? Teach himself how to drive the boat? What happens now is, my brother gets flashbacks to this thought process. He starts thinking, Am I supposed to save my father? If so, how? How can I save my father, when there’s no one to tell me how to save my father? He’s the person I want to talk with you about, my brother. He’s going to become a clown. He’s a natural. ” Socko the Clown was starting to weep. I walked over and held him. He felt like my brother, with the way his chest heaved, and the way his head kept moving like a bobble-head doll. * “It’s a pleasure to meet you,” said Mr. Sheriden. “You’re Socko the Clown?” asked Jester. “Until recently I was, yes. ” “Do the thing, then. ” Mr. Sheriden did the thing. “Wow. ” * They sat next to each other and began to get acquainted. I pulled a cigarette from my purse. My blood sugar was low, so I tried not to move too quickly. I passed through the kitchen, out to the smoking porch. The working title for my next book was A Clown is Born. On the front of my notepad, I had written the words “Clown Notes” in purple ink. I lit the cigarette and guessed what they might be doing. Mr. Sheriden would probably want to speak with Jester in his own excruciating terms—as adults so frequently did—but Jester would demand immediate action and want to learn juggling right away. Mr. Sheriden would laugh, invigorated by this enthusiasm. Months and years would pass before my brother mastered the art of clowning. He would be a prodigy, nonetheless. Being Socko the Clown’s protégé would ensure him a career. I would be saddened by my his early departure from home. All was according to plan. * Jester was snoring. His arm dangled over the side of Auntie Emma’s couch. I elbowed the bean-bag chair to make myself more comfortable. Auntie Emma exited her room. She was barefoot. She stepped over dirty clothes and dishes. Her hand came to rest on the top of my head. “Hey, Nancy,” she whispered, “What are you doing awake?” “Can’t sleep,” I told her. “That’s sad,” she said, “A girl your age, having insomnia. ” Her hand moved through my hair, then pulled away, yanking out several strands. I winced. She didn’t notice my expression. “Mama,” Jester was mumbling in his sleep, “Mama. ” I threw a pillow at him.

    "title": "Daryl #1: We Who are Dogs",
    "body": "2018/01/09 - The first dog said hello. The second dog only sniffed at the first dog’s butt. Hello, repeated the first dog. The second dog was hesitant. What are you afraid of? asked the first dog. The second dog finally spoke: I’m afraid that you’ll lead me astray. The first dog said, You’re already a stray. I’m here to show you opportunity. The second dog said, My name is Daryl. The first dog nodded, and said, Come with me, then. * The first dog led Daryl along side streets and through alleyways. Neighborhoods that seem dangerous to humans are often safer and more rewarding from a canine perspective; as the two dogs walked together through the night, they had to force themselves to ignore (at least for the time being) a cornucopia of intoxicating smells. Daryl had not heard a word from the first dog since the walk had begun, but nevertheless he continued to follow. The first dog had a majestic way about him: although his body was thin, and although his coat was matted and dirty, he displayed the posture, movement, and expression of the strongest, most handsome leader. It seemed that however quickly he moved, he never needed to pant. He kept his nose ahead of him and his ears on guard. Daryl was hypnotized. Although the night was bright beneath a clear sky and full moon, the final turn of the dogs’ walk led them into a long stretch of darkness. Daryl asked, Is this where you’re taking me? The first dog slowed but did not stop. He said, It will be brighter, once we get inside. I’m taking you to see the Doctor. He is not a kind man, but he can help you. Remain calm, Daryl, and he will help you. Across the street, a door opened loudly. Two humans laughed and wailed. The first dog picked up speed, and Daryl followed suit. The city was made for humans; it was not made for dogs. We who are dogs are intimately aware of this fact. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "body": "2018/01/08 - We would do it because we love you. We would carry yourbags inside, give you a change of clothes, and look around for an extrablanket. We would sit next to you on the couch and say, Hey, Is thatshow on, even though we don’t watch television very often. That show,although it is meant for children, is usually good for a laugh. It couldhopefully cheer you up, if you were down, or distract you if youneeded distraction. We would speak softly, trying to say the right things. There arecertain conditions with which we cannot fully empathize, because wehave never been in the circumstances ourselves. The two of us woulddecide, without saying so, that our plans to see a local theater groupwould need to be postponed. We would watch the children’s programming. So would you. * We used to paint self-portraits with you. We developed aroutine in which we queued up a playlist of music, poured tall glassesof cranberry juice, then sat ourselves down in a circle. Sometimes youdrew yourself to resemble us, hypothesizing cheekbones and browlinesand a chin-cleft. More often you were an abstract mess. You used tosmear each painting when you were finished, saying, Oh, well. At leastthat killed some time. The task of representing oneself is, we suppose,different for one who is already a caricature. We used to wish that you could stay for a bit longer, but youwere always on the way to somewhere else. We used to walk you to thedoor and say that we hoped your night would be fun. Those were the days when we made silent assumptions about your visits to ourneighborhood. We used to believe that our letting you inside showedsomething impressive in our moral character. * We would look closely at your skin. How strange, we wouldthink, It’s hard to get over the strangeness, knowing that this skin waspainted by one of our kind. One of us, probably Jane, would put anarm around you. Daryl would be trying to keep eye contact. I’ve seen alot of bruised-up cartoon girls, Jane would say. I’ve seen too many,Daryl would add, frowning and then quickly standing up. The two ofus would be momentarily divided, then: he would be distressed, whileshe would be nurturing. Meanwhile, the relationship between us andyou would already feel closer, more genuine, and more transgressivethan ever before. * We might have listened to our parents. We were lectured. Cartoons are dangerous, we were told, They never age, they aren’tbound by our society, and some of them don’t even leave shadows. Wemight not have spoken with you on that first night, when we stood atthe window and watched you through curtains. We might have stifled our horror at how the neighbors coulddo such things to you, a smiley-faced girl who was begging door-todoor. Again and again, it happened—mallets flattened you into awaddling pancake, TNT was exploded in your face, or you were swungaround like a lasso. Sometimes you were pulled into one of thosehomes, where you were subjected to things about which we can onlyguess. You were booted off steps, kicked so that you flew an improbable distance. We might have laughed. We might have given up,knowing as we always have that laughter brings us great rewards. * We would find you asleep. One of your arms would dangleoff the side of the couch. We would prepare a breakfast whileexchanging looks of hesitation. At the smell of frying bacon youwould slowly awaken, rolling over and stretching a few times beforestanding up. It would be a new sight for us, a creature like you in adomestic scene like this. You would surprise us by putting an armaround each of our waists, pulling us into a huddle, and then saying,Thank you. We would be struck by your casual devotion. You’re welcome,we would say. You would wander off to the bathroom. We wouldconsider practical solutions. * We never saw you outside our apartment. The rest of theworld never interfered, and so the dynamic between us and you, whenyou visited, could feel almost natural. We were excited and nervousaround you, no matter what you put forth. We handled you in the wayour grandparents once handled photo albums—as a key to our identitythat was irreplaceable. We never spoke of emotions around you. We discussedcartoon culture, instead. You sat still during these conversations,politely nodding your bulbous, grinning, yellow head. As still and asquiet as you always were, we loved having you around. You weren’t themost beautiful cartoon, but you were our cartoon, our secretconnection to a forbidden world. * We would close the door to the bedroom and whisper. Daryl would say, This is my fault, it’s me who’s always making himself upset about cartoons, I get hung up thinking about what if they do have feelings in the way that we do, and if it’s just because they’re scripted a certain way and we can’t understand it. Jane would say, No, Honey, I agree with you. I’m glad. I’m actually glad that I’m with someone who wants to do the right thing. It’s just that we can’t. Daryl would say, I know, it’s not going to make a difference. It’s just going to cause problems. Jane would say, For all of us. Daryl would say, I know, I understand. * We are good people. She is sensitive, but strong; he is strong, but sensitive. Still, we are not exceptional: anyone who saw you through our curtains the way we saw you that first day would share our gentle fantasy of you. And fantasies only go so far. We will see you again, our smiley-faced girl, and we know that you’ll be as happy as ever. You’ll still be walking these streets and facing these indignities: these are the conditions to which you’ve been accustomed. Our kind has given you a smile, and you have learned to use it wisely. * We wish that we could better demonstrate our love for you. We just wouldn’t know how to, because we haven’t known the conditions ourselves. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "body": "2018/01/07 - “My mom misses me, sure, but I’ll go back there someday. Ijust had to come to California and find myself, I suppose. I didn’t havea lot of friends back in Lowell. ” He grimaces and looks down, shakeshis upper body like a boxer. Then steps back to the mirror. “It’s hard being away fromhome. Because I have a home. Sure I do. ” Crinkles his nose. Practicing. Trying to sound convincing. These are lies, of course. A double helix of cigarette smoke spirals up into thebathroom vent until our hero breathes. Then it’s broken into fog,setting a mood, establishing place. A motel room. Sun beating pastclosed curtains. One hundred three degree weather outside. Some sortof Mexican music and squealing brakes, muffled slightly by drywall. Toothpaste he stole last week, the only thing he has ever stolen. Freakteenager read too many books, thinks he can just drop out, find a job,find somewhere to live. Has a hotel room; that won’t last. Our hero says the word, “Family,” to himself. He says itbrightly. He means to be sarcastic, but his tongue fails him. As it oftendoes. This week’s payment for the room has left him with about eightydollars of the birthday and Christmas money he always saved, neverspent, because he wanted to live alone someday. Wanted to run away,work full-time. Blue eyes widen to look further into themselves. He stares, anunlikable boy, always was, always unwilling to compete. The teachersalways glared. Insubordinate, contemplative, bookish. Hyperventilatingaccordions and worn rotors catch his attention. He concludes his thought: “Family. Is an excuse. For what happens to the rest of us. ”And he appears serious. His peers used to attack him, attack each other, kids being kidsand nothing to be done, but he never quite needed stitches, but he stillhad felt wronged. His parents could barely take care of themselves. Hedecided to leave high school with dignity. The odds are against him,but our hero is brave. Our hero is doing his best. It is a character traitdifficult to forgive, he thinks. * Mark only wants a home and a community of friends. Alicia,on the other hand, is driven by curiosity. She left a decent life andsupportive family. She still calls her mother daily. Knocking at the door. Red-tinted sunglasses she isn’t used to. The drawing pad under her arm tries to slip away, but she just has toplay it cool. He’ll open the door in a second. She also has a plastic bagfull of drawing implements. All of these art supplies, except maybe acouple of them, were purchased in Minnesota and shipped in boxesafter she flew here. She won’t be using them today, but she mighttomorrow, or the day after that. And Mark is the subject she would liketo draw. His noodley thinness. At least she has a bed to share for now,with a girl named Kristen, but no boys are allowed to stay thereovernight, so Mark stays elsewhere. The sun kisses her neck, but it’s in a creepy way. Like, get awayfrom me, sun. Yuck. Pigtails, the best of a bad hair situation. Toomany degrees out, however many there are. Go away, degrees. A view from behind of the fast food restaurant next door, itsdumpster overflowing into puddles on the flat, gray cement. A smell of abrasive sunlight. Mark’s room on the second level. She has walkedup the outdoor steps, past the soda machine, past the tired oldcleaning lady with her cart full of towels and sadness. What day of theweek is it? Thursday, right? Finally the door opens. “Hey. ” It’s our hero, Mark, almostmaking eye contact but then just letting the door swing open andmotioning in our heroine. Alicia, who is our heroine, groans a relieved hello. She lets thedrawing pad and bag of supplies fall to the queen size bed. “I am soready to make this happen. To move back to somewhere with clouds. ”Steering herself directly to the sink. “Do you have a washcloth? I’mgoing to have nightmares of Fresno summers for the rest of my life. ” * Our hero paces in frantic thoughtfulness. He is tall, fairskinned, dressed entirely in black, seventeen years old. Our heroine,eighteen, with the face of a protected child, an extrovert when shefeels safe, prone on the bed, periwinkle socks kicking the pillow, in abright pink, flared dress, has sunburnt shoulders. Turns the pages ofthe road atlas until she gets to California. “I guess we start off goingnorth, probably. Right?” “I assume so,” says Mark. “There must be more peopleheading towards San Francisco than towards, what, Nevada? That’llprobably be the easy part, catching a ride for that portion. ” “Ooo! Ooo ooo!” “Ooo?” Mark does not get people’s attention in this way. “Let’s put up posters to get a ride there!” “Posters?” Alicia reins in her excitement a bit. “Or, and we can askaround, too, at, like, Java Time especially, but also the head shop. Yourfriends know people at the City College, right?” Mark slowly releases a full breath of air through the corner ofhis mouth. “Yes?” He finally says. “A couple of people who go there?I guess I don’t know if I want to go the way of posters. ” He alsodoesn’t know if he wants talk to anyone he knows in Fresno anymore. He doesn’t know if they like him anymore. “What if I make the posters with glitter?” His mouth, prepared to speak, now silenced. Jaw closed into asmile. What if he kissed her. What if he kissed her right now. “Tempting,” he says. In a sing-songy voice, moving a thing of glitter through theair. “Gliiiiiitter. Glitter!” Or if he proved that boys and girls could be friends. Becausefriends are more likely to keep coming around forever, even findinghim in other parts of the country if necessary. The important thing isto find a home, some city where he can know people, hang out withpeople, find a job and some roommates. They can kiss later if theywant to. He and she, he and anyone else. But what if right now he didit. If he just bounced onto the bed in front of her and leaned in. Itcould mean marriage, or it could mean death. But not really marriage. Someone would have to give them work and a place to live first. Theseare unsympathetic characters. You don’t relate to them. It’s okay. It’sokay. You don’t have to. It’s okay.

    "title": "Diary of a Little Girl #1: Chicken Nugget Macaroni Casserole",
    "body": "2018/01/06 - When I was thirteen, I decided that I was a person. David wasonly ten at the time, so I decided for him, too. Practically speaking, westill hadn’t invented our parents yet. The two of us regularly discussed our expectations for thefuture, and we tried to be realistic in doing so. Having a cute face andprecocious wit, I was probably going to be horrifically abused,traumatized, and turned into a recluse. David, being effeminate aboveand beyond the standard awkwardness of his age, and showing atendency to stare too long at certain other boys in class, was probablygoing to be beaten up by groups of large, angry men. My intellectwould never be rewarded because of my gender. His sensitivity wouldbe punished because of his own. Successful people typically camefrom well-connected families, and so we would in all likelihood bepoor and desperate for the rest of our lives. Despite all this, we hadheard that we were fortunate to be living in America, so we did hangon to some small traces of optimism. We agreed that Dad would have been better off withoutMom. His ideas of positive thinking, even if they had beeninspirational during his life, had failed us in the end. “Follow yourdreams,” he always had liked to say; but under Mom’s custody, our‘dreams’ were becoming things like “learn to sew David’s pants suchthat they won’t rip again” and “figure out how to use the caulkinggun”. Instead of hoping for a better future, I liked to imagine romanticscenarios, trying to explain why our father had married such an unstable and unmotherly person. “Maybe they both knew a secret,” I would say, “And theycouldn’t tell anyone else. ” “Come on, Nancy,” David would respond. “What sort ofsecret could be that important?” “Like, if they worked for the government. On flying saucers. And they spoke to those little gray aliens. ” “Oh. Yeah, that must be it. ” Then he would get back to hisreading. * I tried to be creative in the dinners I prepared, but David waspicky. In response to any food he didn’t recognize, he would raise aneyebrow, poke inquisitively with his fork, and brood in front of thedish until I offered something different. As a compromise, I began tomake sure that of all my culinary inventions involved chicken nuggets. Without fail, he ate anything that had a base of or was mixed withchicken nuggets. Whether my invention was chicken nugget macaronicasserole, chicken nugget enchiladas, or cream of broccoli chickennugget soup, he never would let his favorite food go uneaten. My creative cooking, more than it expressed what I thoughtmight taste good, indicated how well the two of us were doingfinancially. There never was any way for us to predict when the nextassortment of currency would be slid under the door from Mom’swing of the house. Nor could we predict whether the total would be$13, $145, or, as happened once, $1,038. Chicken nugget stir-fry madefrom fresh vegetables meant that we’d been able to splurge at thesupermarket. Chicken nugget-and-ramen soup was a bad sign. * We hadn’t seen our mother since Dad’s death. On therefrigerator, a black and round magnet held our last non-pecuniarymessage from the woman who had given birth to us: Be back when I’mready, it read, Here’s some cash for the interim. Most afternoons, after we arrived home from school, wewould do our homework immediately. Then I would start dinner whileDavid listened to the radio or drew in his sketchbook. We developed asort of ritual in which we closed curtains, lit candles, and pretended tobe dining in a fancy restaurant. “Your chicken nugget parmesan,monsieur,” I would say, uncovering his dish from a cover meant toprevent splattering inside the microwave oven. * Nights were for walking. We would jump over rain-filledpotholes past identical-looking houses of neighbors we had never met. There were tall trees in every backyard and taller fences behind everytree. Looking up, we could see a typical Overlook sky—the green andbrown of broken leaves jutting against a canvas of distant blue. Squirrels laughed from above, hoarding their acorns. We would walk through somebody else’s yard, carrying a bigyellow flashlight, to get to the woods. As was true on every property,the flickering of television could be seen through curtains. Plastictoddler bikes, covered by a black dirt, lay in the grass. I would leadDavid down the hill and into the forest, reminding him before ourdescent about the dangers of slippery leaves and branches. The forest was a sort of dark that nobody could film. It was apowerful and dangerous thing for us to bring our hand-held light there. At the bottom of this hill was a small stream, a torn-up loveseat,and the base of another hill. Sometimes we sat here, at the lowestpoint of these woods. Other times, we wandered through the moredensely-forested areas. We speculated about how long it had beensince anyone else had walked that ground. As much as we knew in theory that society would destroy us,we didn’t yet understand why we couldn’t spend our entire lives in theplaces that no one bothered to visit.

    "title": "In Search of Ann-Marie",
    "body": "2018/01/05 - I kept begging that she should lead me to the place where shewas magic. Across the river the General stood, as always. I hadwatched this statue’s dedication at the age of six. I had waved mysouvenir flag at an ancient troop of soldiers. Nothing in Overlook, on our side of the bridge, could drawthe light of the moon quite so fully as the General. Ann-Marie lookedfirst to him when I asked for her magic. She thought; I thought. Then,the moon was covered from the lot of us—from me, from Ann-Marie,and from the General. * We didn’t know it as we climbed the ladder, but her father wasdying. By chance I would be with her when she learned. His estatewould be hers. The ladder had taken us to the stairway, and the stairway hadtaken us to the top of the bridge. The gates were never locked in thosedays. Returning to her house the next morning, we still were going tosmell like sky. A part of her might have sensed that I would be the lastOverlook boy to see her in this way. She didn’t clasp my elbow as shesometimes had done. We talked about her family. I drank hercranberry juice. Her eyes turned green. She wiped my chin. “This isn’t where I’m magic,” she said, then laughed at herown language. We never questioned each other when we spoke like that. Wewere just children, doing what children are made to do. We watched the sun rise before it reached the horizon. We were awake before time,but knew that it would find us. We knew that time would catch us andthat where it caught us would be where our lives began. We weredetermined to look like soldiers when it came. * This is why I’m hesitant: I expect that you want a history, butI can only give you a mythology. More than she loved any of her men,or any of her projects, she loved her stories, so these are what Iremember of her. I suppose you’ll be getting in touch with those notoriousfriends of hers. Let me tell you this much in advance: they, with alltheir cunning, could never have understood her. If they had allowed,she would have loved them enough to last lifetimes. My fear is thatyou, like so many, would let her be seen as heartless. * The city of Dandelion was raised from a field of dandelions. Along the waterfront, past the statue, a rectangular plot is set aside forthem. When they’ve turned white and the wind has picked up from thesouth, seeds seem to break free of their own volition. Their tinyaspirations dive toward the water, upstream. We had walked 25 blocks from the Weed City Café. It was aholiday weekend. She said that she had missed me. Accessoriesoverbore her basic wardrobe: she wore a necklace, a hat, and a scarf, allat the same time. I made her take these off. She was influential in her own right among Dandelion’ssubculture. She had graced the cover of the alternative weekly, posedwith a clove cigarette while perched on a park bench. These were the things I already knew. I was a college student then. I gave her a pieceof my candy bar. She stared at me as though I were an angel. Neither of us had ever skipped rocks before. We tried to makethem hop along the surface of the river. We failed. There was no wind. The dandelions were yellow. We couldn’t see, but we heard a couple asthey made love under the bridge. Ann-Marie wasn’t following in thefootsteps of her father. She didn’t share his profession. She hadcrossed the Overlook Bridge without pausing to remember whereshe’d been. This fact would need to catch up with her sometime. Since she had taken off her accessories, she told me, I shouldkindly remove my heart from my sleeve. I smiled and began to retort,but she covered my mouth. She kissed her own fingers as they stayedmy lips. Her breath smelled like excess. Nobody knew where she was. Next, she was famous. * A proper history could make her a legend. I can’t say that shewouldn’t have wanted a legacy. Myself, I fear history; I don’t want tobecome lost in it. It’s not likely that any of this will set your record straight, butthese are the things that we told each other. These are the things thatwe believed. They’re all that I can offer. * Ann-Marie danced. She pushed her body against mine. Shemoved her arms above her head. She gave me a wink and a friendlysmile. I tried to relax. I saw her as others must have seen her. I couldn’tlook directly into her eyes. I had been renting a bedroom in a couple’s attic. I had been working in a public school. I had been listening to old LPs given to meby an uncle in Barcelona. Then, suddenly, I was in the arms of a famous person. I sawthe sheen of her lip gloss and the new softness in her complexion. Isaw her hair, which bounced, revolted, then conceded its form. Itouched her swaying hips. I felt the way that the others must havewanted her. She left me and I had to socialize on my own. I drank morethan I should have. She “checked in” every half hour or so, only tovanish again. I told strangers about the Overlook Bridge. They laughedtheir high-pitched, startling laughs. I had been drinking tea in the evenings. I had been readingnovels. I had been cursing the television. I couldn’t complain, overall:my life was more than I had hoped for. By the time Ann-Marie took my hand and bid me to comealong with her, I was in love with my resentment of her world. Iwatched the flashing of her underarm as she put on her jacket. Shespun herself around me. One hand set itself in the small of my back,then the other forced itself over my heart. She looked at me with hergame face, then crossed her eyes and stuck out her tongue. Shelaughed the same laugh that I had heard from the others. Soon, wewere in the taxi. She wiped her face with the sleeves of her dress. She staredout the window. She told the driver, “Take us in circles, and neverstop. ” She pulled a flask from her jacket. I mocked her. She told me toshut up. She hit my chest with her fist. It hurt, more than she knew. She said that she should have visited me, that she should have told me her stories under the Overlook Bridge. I thanked her for showing memore of this city. She hit me again. She said that she loved me, that I was like a brother to her. She let herself fall onto my shoulder. She was heavy, for someone sothin, and her face drew the lights of the city. * She tried for a lifetime to share herself; I doubt that you’ll findher now. She wanted a voice and only found notoriety. Don’t besurprised if, when you’ve finished your research, you’re only moreconfused about the life of Ann-Marie.

    "title": "Eric in Los Angeles #1: The Illusionist’s Interview",
    "body": "2018/01/04 - “I was kept in a cage a lot like this one,” said the illusionist. He laughed. He was handsome. “But, you know, I went to high schoolin such different times. It seems like there isn’t a kid alive now whohasn’t been so coddled that they’re useless. They all get told thatthey’re unique, that they’re precious, that they’re entitled to a certainlifestyle. Ha!” He motioned for his friend to look. His friend saw an adolescent boy watching through a chainlink fence. “Help!” bellowed the boy. “They won’t let me out!” He shookthe fence. A journalist and photographer stood on the sidewalk with theillusionist and his friend. They all shared a laugh. The boy spat andhollered, in the way that boys do. He pretended to cry. “Kids are so weird,” said the illusionist. * There was a drought in Los Angeles that year. There had alsobeen a drought the previous year. It was a problem, maybe. “This is where I tried my first puff of weed,” said theillusionist, whose name was Eric. Then he turned to the journalist andpoked her in the chest. “Don’t print that. ” Everybody smiled and looked around. They were now twoblocks from the high school and less than a mile from the airport. Famous and influential people in the entertainment business flewabove them through a cloud-free sky. Eric was famous, too. “Now, look,” he said. “I think you can read my billboard from here. Mystery and thrills for the whole family. ” The photographer squinted. “I think you’re right. I’m trying toread. Mystery and thrills! The rest is hard to… Oh! For the entirefamily! I see it now. ” The illusionist smiled. “Whole family, entire family. It’s thesame thing. ” His hair was an unnatural blue-black. His eyes were justgorgeous. * “How did you become a magician?” asked a boy of about six. Each piece of clothing that the boy wore—his tee-shirt, his shorts, hishat, socks, tennis shoes—was its own explosively bright color. He wasa rainbow lacking only blue, red, and pink. “I started off a lot like you,” said the illusionist. “In fact, Ilived right here in this neighborhood. ” “Did you go to my school?” asked the boy, excited. A youngman at the end of the block yelled in another language after him. “Probably not,” said the illusionist. “But I got my start byreading tarot cards. I got my first pack from my older brother. Once Iwas good, I would take the bus all the way to Hollywood Boulevard,and—“ The man screamed again, more loudly, and the boy reactedimmediately this time. “No! Papa, no!” he yelled, chasing after theman. The illusionist looked at the journalist. The journalistshrugged, hit a button on her iPhone, and let it fall into the pocket ofher blue purse. This boy, too, cried pretend tears as he ran. * “I’m good with a lot of kids, I promise,” said the illusionist. The friend punched him in the arm. “Why are you scaringaway the kids, man?” The journalist nodded. “We’ll get this done. ” The photographer was contemplative or annoyed. “I don’t likethese shadows. ” * Within the half-hour, a different boy ran up. “I’m your biggestfan!” he boasted. The coterie of adults nodded to each other. A father came upafter the boy and said, congenially, “It’s true. He is a real big fan. ” “I want to become a magician, too!” the boy said. “Well, you know,” said the illusionist, “I had no idea thiswould be my career until I was way, way older than you are. I just knewthat I was good at performing. And do you know what I did? Now, Imight not recommend it, because it’s a little spooky. And a lot ofpeople don’t believe in it. But I read what are called tarot cards. ” “Yeah?” Eric avoided looking at the father. “See, the idea was thatthere are powers bigger than us, and that those powers would decidewhich card would come up. So I would draw a series of cards, andeach of them would say something different about the same person’sstory. And while sometimes the card I drew from my deck would beupright, other times it would be reversed—upside-down—and thatwould mean there was something in the way, some block that wasinterfering with the energies of what the card represented. ” He had thought the boy would be thrown off by this speech, but he wasn’t. Instead, he just said, “Cool! I started mixing music on myfriend’s laptop. I think I’ll be a performer, too. ” It was a perfectly cute exchange in the end, with upwardpitched voices all around. All that was left was to take photographs—“To be in a magazine, maybe,” the illusionist explained, “Butdefinitely so we can send you copies. ” The boy looked down while his dad stepped closer to him. “Smile for the camera!” said the dad. The son did notrespond, so the dad pushed him. It was a quick movement—a startlinglittle push, like the one that begins a bar fight. But children can neithereffectively fight nor effectively drink, so the son needed to smile. “You never let me have my face the way I want it,” he said,smiling. “They are trying to take your picture,” said the dad. It’s okay. We recorded the cute stuff, said a waving of thejournalist’s hand. “Your smile is fantastic!” the photographer sang to the child.

I will alwaysultimately be wrong, or else, by definition, there is no ultimus. When Iam wrong, that is not for me to know. When I am wrong, therepercussions end for me. Until something transcends me, I transcendall. That is my reason, you frustrating head-doubt. Okay. I will wake up tomorrow, hurting but alive. That is most likelytrue. You can’t tell me that I should give up. You can’t tell me not tomake decisions. Who are you to do that, you. * I dusted my writing desk. I have nothing much to write aboutanymore, but the desk is a resting place for magazines. Most of myimportant mail is opened and dealt with downstairs by mygranddaughter or her family or whoever without my input. I have notime to get angry about these things. Legal or illegal, moral orimmoral, I have not been fighting that. Their generation would shoutforever if it could, but I could barely muster a moan in opposition. Iwould never win that argument. I am simply too old to manage my own credit, mygranddaughter has kept telling me, laughing at my perseverance. So I have taken her MasterCard. I snuck it out from her ugly orangehandbag. She tells me that the bag is pink; she is mistaken. She alwayswas foolish, even if she was good in history and science. I snuck thecredit card because it will get me away. I’m going somewhere else, forgood and for finally. The place I am going to is not going to beWormleysburg. I have only some vague ideas where the place will be, but itwill be magical. I have found magic before. You are abusive. You canall go to hell. I am going to find the magic, all right, and you are notgoing to stop me. * I planned silently. No Googling. No scratch paper. No onecould retrace what plans I have. All that I have written has been inkedin cipher on a wide-ruled sheet of notebook paper. This paper is in theside pocket of these khaki pants. I speak quietly into my telephone. Thirty minutes, I say. Donot honk. I give the address for Wormleysburg Variety. This is a fiveand dime, one road down from where I have been living. A familyowns it. I don’t know who they are. It was the Stacewiczes beforethem. I only moved from Harrisburg fifteen years ago, but most of thebusinesses in this neighborhood already have been replaced orchanged hands. When I step outside onto the wooden steps, I meet snow thatdoes not clump. It amounts to lazy pellets on my duster. There issurprisingly little wind. Sometimes in a snowstorm, the outdoor lightwould be suffocated. I would feel adrift and alone. The landing wouldlook like a raft in some dark, stupid ocean. But tonight it is well-lit. Like so many other things, this action I am taking could lead to mydeath. Regardless, I have risked more important things than the life ofa ninety-nine-year-old asshole. Wa-hoo. Let’s get started with this,then. Ow. Shit. No, it’s okay. No, I’ve got this. Ow. Shit. Wa-hoo. (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"

    "body": "2018/01/02 - I was beautiful to him. He had had his doubts, as I probablydid too, but now that he was holding my hand, walking with me alongthe beach, tapping and clacking and caressing the wedding ring aroundthe fourth digit of my tiny, soft hand, he was glad that I was his wife. There was wind blowing sand up his shorts, lightening his dark bodyhair, and as we walked he kept looking for the perfect view. He wantedme to thank him for the sun, the atmosphere, the curvature of theearth, and the commercial for this resort he had seen on television. He smiled. He hoped that it didn’t bother me, but he just hadto accelerate his pace a bit, to pull that tiny hand of mine instead ofonly relaxing his fist around it. There was, he thought, the perfect-looking cliff up ahead. Something to climb up and peer over. Hewanted to reach it by sunset. I would understand when I got there whyhe had stepped up his pace. He knew that this was love. Love was the compulsion he hadnow, the one that made him want to seize a vista just like those onpostcards. Because he loved me, he would find the perfect sunrise forme. It would be beyond my hopes for this honeymoon, more than Ihad even thought to imagine. He would take me far from our hoteland then get me back safely. He would tell me that he loved me, andhe would give me his full attention. I said something about the breeze. He said that it made myhair look sexy. He said that he liked it when my hair was messed up,that I didn’t have to do all that other stuff I always did to it. Hepressed forward bravely. He noticed me breathing heavier as wehurried along the sands. I appeared to be shivering slightly. It madehim feel like we were on an expedition, a mission, a quest. The cliff was more distant than it had looked. The sun setover the ocean in a way that was fine but not entirely what he had beenhoping for. He kissed me anyway. * Finally I was away from my family. They had never treated methe way a daughter should be treated, he thought to himself. Seatednext to me on the outside deck under tiki lamps, he sipped a vodkasoda with lime. It was the drink he had seen me drink so many timesback home, so many times that the sight of it functioned almost as anaphrodisiac for him, reminding him of those early days and howuntouchable I had seemed. Tonight he had ordered one, then anotherround for the both of us. The stress of the wedding and all the politicsaround it looked to be falling off me with each successive sip. Evenwithout money or direction I had been hopeful in life. Even withoutexperience I had always known how to please him, how to relax him,how to calm him down when he was angry. It made him want to sharethe world with me. It made him want to make me his partner and hisequal. * Three drinks in, it was the hour for tacos. Could there beanything better than tacos at night on the beach in an island paradise?He got his with extra sour cream, while I got mine with guacamole. Hetold me that he liked sour cream and mayonnaise and other superwhite things because he himself was the whitest human being ever,that he was so pale you could practically see his organs through hisskin. He said that his ancestors were Irish and they didn’t see much ofthe sun there so that explained that. I might not have been able tofollow what he was trying to say. Aside from the drinks, he had wokenup really early that morning, too. I told him that green reminded me of forests, which was thesort of landscape I loved best. I loved forests and mountains. He saidthat I shouldn’t have fallen asleep during Fellowship of the Ring, then,because there was a lot of nice scenery in that movie, and amazingcinematography. Then he bit into his last taco of the night. I told him that I loved him. His chest swelled. He said heloved me, too. * He went to sleep. I was obliged to him, now, and he to me. Ipushed the soles of my bare feet forward and back between the softsheets. He dreamed that someone was after him, someone he had tobe certain not to be intimidated by. Others had been intimidated bythe threat, a man who could not attack if kept at a distance but who, iflet close, was likely to cut with a knife, so deeply that the sheets wouldbe stained red. In the dream he found the perfect rhythm, because theman who was after him would sense and exploit weakness at apredictable pace. My husband could only let his guard down for as long as theattacker in his dreams would let him. My legs rubbed against eachother. I was not sleeping. I must still have had things on my mind,more than he knew. Next time, he would try a massage of my neck, orperhaps my back, or perhaps my full body. There was only one person in the world he loved this much, only one he could lie this close to. That person was me, me, beautifulme. He would have his doubts again, day after day, because he couldnot always help me, because I would sometimes become melancholyover the sheer distance of things. But he would love me anyway.

    "title": "Wormleysburg Variety #1: The Overlook-Perch",
    "body": "2018/01/01 - Never again will I come back to this place. I have degrees. Tokens. Memories of more reckless human contact, from when my skin integrity could be better trusted. And, yes, a granddaughter who maintains this place adequately, now that she is certain I am nearly dust. But as much as she thinks I am dust, I still dust myself. Rather, I myself dust in this attic, using a rag. The rag is taken from some trousers worn to death. Wa-hoo. I do this late, late into the evening, defying stereotypes of the elderly. Defying, if with no one to see. Thank you, pain. You are candid. You’re frank. You are a makeshift audience for me. Did no culture have any god, any goddess for pain? An old man’s pain has sophisticated tastes, and I need to account for them all precisely. It’s like Showtime at the Apollo; sometimes I am booed off the stage. That’s a show I have seen. But here, the stage I have been booed off from is all the world beyond my bed. When I am rejected by the pain, I am denied my standing tolerance. Then I have nothing to do again, and I certainly can’t dust. I am on the second floor. It is counter-intuitive for a man of my age, but my living arrangement has been fine in this regard. I mostly just wish that my granddaughter had not moved us across the river to Wormleysburg. I have missed the noises of youth below me. I have missed my place in Harrisburg, where I was noted and yearnedfor, ambitious—and this even when I was almost old. And I havemissed the things I should never tell, the stupid and generic things aswell as the mystical and obscene. Also, my granddaughter is awful. Society wishes me to be pressured into death along with my peers. Ifight the quietude of this overlook-perch. I set down the rag. I lift the aerosol can with my left hand. Myright wrist, if I drive it down with enough force, will trigger the releaseof contents under pressure. My weak fingers offer no apologies forhow difficult they make this. The challenge keeps me focused anddemonstrably human. It’s snowing outside. The flakes become potent with windbehind them. No one has bothered to improve the insulation of thishouse. Some things never change. I try not to regret what passed. What passed was everyone and everything—every lover, everycolleague, every child. The hierarchy of value. Every aftershave andrestaurant. My homes in Paris and Barcelona, which some insist to mestill were not real. Or maybe they were just quoting some cynicaltelevision commercial, as they so often do. But the point is that I candust. I lift my arm nearly to the level of my shoulder. Wa-hoo. Ineed to rest soon.  (you have my permission to buy a copy of wormleysburg variety by clicking on this link)"
